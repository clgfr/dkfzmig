We conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify germline variants associated with survival in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

Methods We analysed overall survival in relation to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among 1005 patients from two large GWAS datasets, PanScan I and ChinaPC. Cox proportional hazards regression was used in an additive genetic model with adjustment for age, sex, clinical stage and the top four principal components of population stratification. The first stage included 642 cases of European ancestry (PanScan), from which the top SNPs (p10(-5)) were advanced to a joint analysis with 363 additional patients from China (ChinaPC).

Results In the first stage of cases of European descent, the top-ranked loci were at chromosomes 11p15.4, 18p11.21 and 1p36.13, tagged by rs12362504 (p=1.63x10(-7)), rs981621 (p=1.65x10(-7)) and rs16861827 (p=3.75x10(-7)), respectively. 131 SNPs with p10(-5) were advanced to a joint analysis with cases from the ChinaPC study. In the joint analysis, the top-ranked SNP was rs10500715 (minor allele frequency, 0.37; p=1.72x10(-7)) on chromosome 11p15.4, which is intronic to the SET binding factor 2 (SBF2) gene. The HR (95% CI) for death was 0.74 (0.66 to 0.84) in PanScan I, 0.79 (0.65 to 0.97) in ChinaPC and 0.76 (0.68 to 0.84) in the joint analysis.

Conclusions Germline genetic variation in the SBF2 locus was associated with overall survival in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma of European and Asian ancestry. This association should be investigated in additional large patient cohorts.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>63 (1), 152-160</Feld596><PubVol>63</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>152</StrtPage><EndPage>160</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Wu C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Kraft P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Stolzenberg-Solomon R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Steplowski E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Brotzman M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Xu M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Mudgal P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Amundadottir L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Arslan AA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Gross M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Helzlsouer K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Jacobs EJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Kooperberg C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Petersen GM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Zheng W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Albanes D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Boutron-Ruault MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Buring JE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Canzian F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="20" name="Cao G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Duell EJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Elena JW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Gaziano JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Giovannucci EL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Hallmans G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Hutchinson A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Hunter DJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Jenab M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Jiang G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Lacroix A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Li Z" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Mendelsohn JB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Panico S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Patel AV" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Qian ZR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Sesso H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Shen H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Shu XO" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Tobias GS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Trichopoulos D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="44" name="Virtamo J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="45" name="Visvanathan K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="46" name="Wactawski-Wende J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="47" name="Wang C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="48" name="Yu K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="49" name="Zeleniuch-Jacquotte A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="50" name="Chanock S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="51" name="Hoover R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="52" name="Hartge P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="53" name="Fuchs CS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="54" name="Lin D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="55" name="Wolpin BM" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>23180869</PMID><DOI>10.1136/gutjnl-2012-303477</DOI><KST>C055</KST><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUSCEPTIBILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>chemotherapy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GEMCITABINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE POLYMORPHISMS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LUNG-CANCER PATIENTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MYOTUBULARIN-RELATED PROTEIN-2</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SBF2</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>35545</publishedID><Artikel>Blinded versus unblinded covariate selection in confirmatory survival trials</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Biopharmaceutical Statistics</Journal><ABSTr>Adjustment for covariates and specification of the correct covariate set are important issues in the analysis of clinical trials. Edwards ( 1999 ) proposes a model selection approach where the model is chosen on the final data set, which remains blinded for treatment group allocation. We investigate this method for time-to-event endpoints and compare its performance to variable selection within an adaptive design. This adaptive design integrates the methods of Schäfer and Müller ( 2001 ) and Keiding et al. ( 1987 ) and allows variable selection on the unblinded data during an interim analysis. Monte Carlo simulation shows that Edwards' method-though blinded-outperforms the adaptive method in terms of ability to select the survival relevant covariates and power. The application of the methods is illustrated by a clinical trial example.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>24 (2), 398-414</Feld596><PubVol>24</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>398</StrtPage><EndPage>414</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kunz,C."

The present study was conducted to investigate whether white matter tracts associated with these regions are also affected in the early stages of the disorder.

METHODS: Using a 1.5 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner and fiber tracking, the optic radiations and the middle cerebellar peduncles were examined in 13 adolescents with first-admission schizophrenia and 13 healthy controls matched for age, gender, school type, and handedness.

RESULTS: Patients with schizophrenia displayed significantly decreased fractional anisotropy in the optic radiations, but no differences in the middle cerebellar peduncles compared to healthy controls.

CONCLUSIONS: Our findings of altered fiber integrity in the optic radiations in adolescents with schizophrenia are in line with gray matter alterations in the visual cortices previously reported in the same sample and are in accordance with other studies that found decreased fractional anisotropy in these regions. These findings support the view that the visual system plays an important role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and may enhance our understanding of associations between the visual cortex and symptoms of the disorder.

Design: Cross-sectional observational study. Setting and Participants: A total of 1,697 subjects with a mean +/- standard deviation age of 74 +/- 2.8 years were included. These were recruited from among the participants of an ongoing epidemiological study of the elderly general population in Saarland state and had been recruited 5 years earlier on the occasion of a health screening exam by their general practitioners. Measurements: Cognitive functioning across six sub-domains was assessed using the Cognitive Telephone Screening Instrument. Data on prevalent diabetes at baseline were obtained from the study participants and their general practitioners. Baseline fasting glucose was assessed as part of the screening exam, and baseline HbA1c was determined centrally by standardized methods. Results: The association of cognitive functioning with self-reported diabetes (N = 189) was more pronounced than with physician-reported diabetes (N = 280). HbA1c showed a nonlinear association with cognitive functioning, with a peak of cognitive performance in the central quintile of HbA1c. In the case of fasting glucose, lower cognitive functioning was only observed in the highest quintile. The estimates were robust in confounder-adjusted models, but attentuated when excluding subjects with baseline prevalent or follow-up incident diabetes. Conclusions: Future studies of diabetes-related biomarkers and cognition should take possible nonlinearity of the relationships into account, as the strength of the associations otherwise might be underestimated.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>22 (11), 1105-1115</Feld596><PubVol>22</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>1105</StrtPage><EndPage>1115</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Breitling LP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Olsen H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Mueller H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schoettker B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kliegel M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Brenner H."

However, the quantification of diffusion parameters in fine structures is especially prone to partial volume effects (PVEs).

MethodsIn this study, a phantom for the investigation of PVEs and their influence on diffusion parameters in fine structures of different diameter is presented. The phantom is produced by winding wet polyester fibers onto a spindle. The resulting fiber strands have well defined square cross-sections of 1-25mm(2) and provide a homogeneous and high fractional anisotropy (FA approximate to 0.9).

ResultsSeveral PVEs are demonstrated and analyzed. It is shown that inferred results such as the fiber geometry and diffusion parameters strongly depend on the relative position of the structure of interest to the voxel-grid. Several implications of PVEs on post-processing methods such as Tract-based Spatial Statistics and fiber tractography are demonstrated.

ConclusionThese results show that the handling of PVEs in common post-processing tasks can be problematic, and that the presented phantom provides a valuable tool for the improvement and evaluation of these effects.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>71 (3), 1108-1116</Feld596><PubVol>71</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>1108</StrtPage><EndPage>1116</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Bach M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Maier-Hein (Fritzsche) KH" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Stieltjes B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Laun F" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>23657980</PMID><DOI>10.1002/mrm.24774.</DOI><KST>E020</KST><KST>E130</KST><KST>E011</KST><KST>E132</KST><KEYWORD>MRI</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>brain</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECONSTRUCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>superresolution</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONNECTIVITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AXON DIAMETER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DTI</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>40817</publishedID><Artikel>Disorder-specific white matter alterations in adolescent borderline personality disorder</Artikel><Journal>Biological Psychiatry</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of borderline personality disorder (BPD) is complex and not fully understood. Using diffusion tensor imaging, recent studies suggest that white matter abnormalities may occur in adult patients with BPD. However, deeper insight into the disorder-specific developmental psychobiology (e.g., analysis of adolescents with BPD; inclusion of clinical control groups) is missing.

METHODS: Twenty adolescent patients with BPD (aged 14-18 years), 20 healthy, and 20 clinical control subjects were assessed using diffusion tensor imaging. All subjects were right-handed girls, matched for age and IQ. Microstructural parameters were analyzed via tractography of the main bundles in the limbic system and using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics, an explorative, global approach.

RESULTS: BPD was associated with decreased fractional anisotropy in the fornix when compared with clinical (p &lt; .001) or healthy (nonsignificant trend) control subjects. Using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics, significant disorder-specific white matter alterations were found in the long association bundles interconnecting the heteromodal association cortex and in connections between the thalamus and hippocampus.

CONCLUSIONS: The study strongly supports the hypothesis that white matter alterations play a key role in the pathogenesis of BPD. These disorder-specific alterations include white matter pathways involved in emotion regulation but also affect parts of the heteromodal association cortex that are related to emotion recognition. Our findings unify previously documented deficits in emotion recognition and regulation and suggest that a large-scale network of emotion processing is disrupted in BPD. Continued research is essential to evaluate the predictive value of these early disruptions in a clinical context.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>75 (1), 81-88</Feld596><PubVol>75</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>81</StrtPage><EndPage>88</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Maier-Hein, KH" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Brunner R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Lutz K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Henze R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Parzer P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Feigl N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Kramer J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Meinzer HP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Resch F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Stieltjes B."

Several of these variants demonstrate associations with multiple cancers, suggesting pleiotropic effects and shared biological mechanisms across some cancers. We hypothesised that SNPs previously associated with other cancers may additionally be associated with colorectal cancer. In a large-scale study, we examined 171 SNPs previously associated with 18 different cancers for their associations with colorectal cancer.

Design We examined 13 338 colorectal cancer cases and 40 967 controls from three consortia: Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE), Genetic Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer (GECCO), and the Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR). Study-specific logistic regression results, adjusted for age, sex, principal components of genetic ancestry, and/or study specific factors (as relevant) were combined using fixed-effect meta-analyses to evaluate the association between each SNP and colorectal cancer risk. A Bonferroni-corrected p value of 2.92x10(-4) was used to determine statistical significance of the associations.

Results Two correlated SNPs-rs10090154 and rs4242382-in Region 1 of chromosome 8q24, a prostate cancer susceptibility region, demonstrated statistically significant associations with colorectal cancer risk. The most significant association was observed with rs4242382 (meta-analysis OR=1.12; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.18; p = 1.74x10(-5)), which also demonstrated similar associations across racial/ethnic populations and anatomical sub-sites.

Conclusions This is the first study to clearly demonstrate Region 1 of chromosome 8q24 as a susceptibility locus for colorectal cancer; thus, adding colorectal cancer to the list of cancer sites linked to this particular multicancer risk region at 8q24.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>63 (5), 800-807</Feld596><PubVol>63</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>800</StrtPage><EndPage>807</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Cheng I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Kocarnik JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Dumitrescu L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Lindor N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Chang-Claude J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Avery C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Caberto C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Love SA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Slattery ML" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Chan AT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Baron J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Hindorff LA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Park SL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Schumacher FR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Hoffmeister M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Kraft P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Butler A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Junkins HA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Duggan D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Hou L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Carlson CS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Monroe K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Lin Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Carty CL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Mann S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Ma J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Giovannucci E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Fuchs C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Newcomb P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Jenkins M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Hopper J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Haile R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Conti DV" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Campbell PT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Potter J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Caan B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Schoen RE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Hayes R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Chanock S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Berndt S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Kury S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Bezieau S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Ambite JL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Kumaraguruparan G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="44" name="Richardson D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="45" name="Goodloe RJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="46" name="Dilks HH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="47" name="Baker P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="48" name="Zanke B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="49" name="Lemire M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="50" name="Gallinger S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="51" name="Hsu L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="52" name="Jiao S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="53" name="Harrison T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="54" name="Seminara D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="55" name="Haiman CA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="56" name="Kooperberg C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="57" name="Wilkens LR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="58" name="Hutter C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="59" name="White E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="60" name="Bush WS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="61" name="Heiss G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="62" name="Hudson TJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="63" name="Crawford DC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="64" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="65" name="Casey G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="66" name="Le Marchand L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="67" name="Peters U."

Knowledge about genetic alterations in DIA/DIG is limited. However, a previous study on BRAF V600E mutation in paediatric glioma revealed a BRAF mutation in one of two tested DIAs/DIGs. The limited number of cases in that study did not allow any conclusion about mutation frequency of BRAF in this tumour entity.

MethodsWe collected a series of 18 DIAs/DIGs for testing BRAF V600E mutational status by BRAF V600E immunohistochemistry (clone VE1). Cases with sufficient DNA were tested for BRAF V600E mutation by pyrosequencing.

ResultsThree out of 18 DIAs/DIGs presented with VE1 binding. A considerable proportion of BRAF V600E mutated tumour cells was detected in the cortical tumour component, whereas the pronounced leptomeningeal tumoural stroma was predominantly negative for VE1 binding. Pyrosequencing confirmed BRAF V600E mutation in two of three VE1-positive cases.

Detection of p.V600E mutation by immunohistochemistry was recently reported in several tumor types. Objective.-To evaluate the interobserver reproducibility of BRAF p.V600E detection by immunohistochemistry in melanoma. Design.-Immunohistochemistry with VE1 antibody was performed on metastatic melanomas of 67 patients. Staining interpretation was performed on digital image virtual slides of tissue microarrays. The p.V600E status was determined by 7 pathologists from 3 European laboratories, blinded for other interpretations and for molecular biology results. Results.-Melanomas had p.V600E (n = 30), p.V600K (n = 4), p.K601E (n = 1), p.600-601delinsE (n = 1), or no p.V600 mutations (n = 31). Staining of p.V600E within mutated cells was cytoplasmic and diffuse, and for each case the staining on the 3 tissue microarray cores was similar. In 53 cases (79.1%) the 7 pathologists had perfect concordance. Agreement of interobserver reproducibility was almost perfect (kappa = 0.81 [0.77-0.85]). Only 2 false-positive responses (0.9%) were obtained. The specificities reported were 100% for 5 pathologists (two of whom previously trained for p.V600E interpretation), and 97% for 2 untrained pathologists. Conclusions.-Detection of BRAF p.V600E mutation by immunohistochemistry in melanomas has an excellent interobserver reproducibility. Our results suggest that immunohistochemistry could be used as a first step for detection of BRAF p.V600E mutation, to identify patients with melanoma as candidates for BRAF inhibitors.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>138 (1), 71-75</Feld596><PubVol>138</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>71</StrtPage><EndPage>75</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Marin C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Beauchet A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Capper D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Zimmermann U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Julie C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Ilie M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Saiag P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="von Deimling A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Hofman P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Emile JF" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>23651150</PMID><DOI>10.5858/arpa.2013-0031-OA</DOI><KST>G380</KST><KEYWORD>VEMURAFENIB</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SENSITIVE DETECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>V600E mutation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIAGNOSTIC-TOOL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SPECIMENS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HER2</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>tissue microarray</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>validation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BREAST-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MALIGNANT-MELANOMA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>41017</publishedID><Artikel>Improved molecular classification of serrated lesions of the colon by immunohistochemical detection of BRAF V600E</Artikel><Journal>Modern Pathology</Journal><ABSTr>BRAF V600E mutation in serrated lesions of the colon has been implicated as an important mutation and as a specific marker for the serrated carcinogenic pathway. Recent findings point to microvesicular hyperplastic polyps that have similar histologic and molecular features to sessile serrated adenomas/polyps, as potential colorectal carcinoma precursors. The aim of this study was to evaluate BRAF V600E mutation status by immunohistochemistry in serrated lesions of the colon with regard to histomorphology. We investigated 194 serrated lesions of the colon, comprising 42 sessile serrated adenomas/polyps, 16 traditional serrated adenomas, 136 hyperplastic polyps and 20 tubular/tubulovillous adenomas (conventional adenomas) with the novel BRAF V600E mutation-specific antibody VE1. In addition, BRAF exon 15 and KRAS exon 2 status was investigated by capillary sequencing in selected cases. All sessile serrated adenomas/polyps (42/42, 100%), 15/16 (94%) traditional serrated adenomas and 84/136 (62%) hyperplastic polyps were VE1+. None of the VE1- serrated lesions showed BRAF V600E mutation. Forty out of 42 (95%) sessile serrated adenomas/polyps displayed areas with microvesicular hyperplastic polyp-like features. In microvesicular hyperplastic polyps, VE1 positivity was significantly associated with nuclear atypia (P = 0.003); however, nuclear atypia was also present in VE1- cases. Immunostaining with VE1 allows not only the detection of BRAF V600E mutation but also the correlation with histomorphology on a cellular level in serrated lesions. VE1 enables a subclassification of microvesicular hyperplastic polyps according to the mutation status. This improved classification of serrated lesions including immunohistochemical evaluation of BRAF V600E mutation may be the key to identify lesions with higher potential to progression into sessile serrated adenoma/polyp, and further to BRAF V600E-mutated colorectal cancer.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>27 (1), 135-144</Feld596><PubVol>27</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>135</StrtPage><EndPage>144</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Mesteri I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Bayer G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Meyer J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Capper D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schoppmann S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="von Deimling A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Birner P."

A p.S151A missense mutation in exon 6 of the Sgcd gene was reported to cause severe isolated autosomal dominant DCM without affecting skeletal muscle. This is controversial to our previous findings in a large consanguineous family where this p.S151A mutation showed no relevance for cardiac disease. In this study, the potential of the p.S151A mutation to cause DCM was investigated by using two different approaches: (1) engineering and characterization of heterozygous knock-in (S151A-) mice carrying the p.S151A mutation and (2) evaluation of the potential of adeno-associated virus (AAV) 9-based cardiac-specific transfer of p.S151A-mutated Sgcd cDNA to rescue the cardiac phenotype in Sgcd-deficient (Sgcd-null) mice as it has been demonstrated for intact, wild-type Sgcd cDNA. Heterozygous S151A knock-in mice developed a rather mild phenotype of cardiomyopathy. Increased heart to body weight suggests cardiac enlargement in 1-year-old S151A knock-in mice. However, at this age cardiac function, assessed by echocardiography, is maintained and histopathology completely absent. Myocardial expression of p.S151A cDNA, similar to intact Sgcd cDNA, restores cardiac function, although not being able to prevent myocardial histopathology in Sgcd-null mice completely. Our results suggest that the p.S151A mutation causes a mild, subclinical phenotype of cardiomyopathy, which is prone to be overseen in patients carrying such sequence variants. Furthermore, this study shows the suitability of an AAV-mediated cardiac gene transfer approach to analyze whether a sequence variant is a disease-causing mutation.European Journal of Human Genetics advance online publication, 22 May 2013; doi:10.1038/ejhg.2013.97.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>22 (1), 119-125</Feld596><PubVol>22</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>119</StrtPage><EndPage>125</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Rutschow D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Bauer R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Gohringer C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Bekeredjian R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schinkel S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Straub V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Koenen M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Weichenhan D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Katus HA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Muller OJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>23695275</PMID><DOI>10.1038/ejhg.2013.97</DOI><KST>C010</KST><KEYWORD>CARDIAC GENE-TRANSFER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>cardiomyocytes</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DYSTROPHIN-GLYCOPROTEIN COMPLEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SARCOSPAN COMPLEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LAMIN A/C</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSDUCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUSCULAR-DYSTROPHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECOMBINANT ADENOASSOCIATED VIRUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VIRAL VECTORS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>41075</publishedID><Artikel>Early epigenetic downregulation of WNK2 kinase during pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma development</Artikel><Journal>Oncogene</Journal><ABSTr>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is usually incurable. Contrary to genetic mechanisms involved in PDAC pathogenesis, epigenetic alterations are ill defined. Here, we determine the contribution of epigenetically silenced genes to the development of PDAC. We analyzed enriched, highly methylated DNAs from PDACs, chronic pancreatitis (CP) and normal tissues using CpG island microarrays and identified WNK2 as a prominent candidate tumor suppressor gene being downregulated early in PDAC development. WNK2 was further investigated in tissue microarrays, methylation analysis of early pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), mouse models for PDAC and pancreatitis, re-expression studies after demethylation, and cell growth assays using WNK2 overexpression. Demethylation assays confirmed the link between methylation and expression. WNK2 hypermethylation was higher in tumor than in surrounding inflamed tissues and was observed in PanIN lesions as well as in a PDAC mouse model. WNK2 mRNA and protein expressions were lower in PDAC and CP compared with normal tissues both in patients and mouse models. Overexpression of WNK2 led to reduced cell growth, and WNK2 expression in tissues correlated negatively with pERK1/2 expression, a downstream target of WNK2 responsible for cell proliferation. Downregulation of WNK2 by promoter hypermethylation occurs early in PDAC pathogenesis and may support tumor cell growth via the ERK-MAPK pathway.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>33 (26), 3401-3410</Feld596><PubVol>33</PubVol><PubIss>26</PubIss><StrtPage>3401</StrtPage><EndPage>3410</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Dutruel C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Bergmann F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Rooman I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Zucknick M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Weichenhan D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Geiselhart L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Kaffenberger T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Rachakonda PS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Bauer A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Giese N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Hong C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name=", Xie H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Costello JF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Hoheisel J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="14" name="Kumar R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Rehli M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Schirmacher P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Werner J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Plass C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="19" name="Popanda O" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="20" name="Schmezer P" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>23912455</PMID><DOI>10.1038/onc.2013.312</DOI><KST>B070</KST><KST>C010</KST><KST>C060</KST><KST>C050</KST><KEYWORD>intraepithelial neoplasia</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>genetics</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA methylation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BIOLOGY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEIN-KINASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHWAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>proliferation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ABERRANT METHYLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL TRANSDIFFERENTIATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>41079</publishedID><Artikel>A genome-wide association study identifies 6p21 as novel risk locus for dilated cardiomyopathy</Artikel><Journal>European Heart Journal</Journal><ABSTr>Aims Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is one of the leading causes for cardiac transplantations and accounts for up to one-third of all heart failure cases. Since extrinsic and monogenic causes explain only a fraction of all cases, common genetic variants are suspected to contribute to the pathogenesis of DCM, its age of onset, and clinical progression. By a large-scale case-control genome-wide association study we aimed here to identify novel genetic risk loci for DCM.

Methods and reuslts Applying a three-staged study design, we analysed more than 4100 DCM cases and 7600 controls. We identified and successfully replicated multiple single nucleotide polymorphism on chromosome 6p21. In the combined analysis, the most significant association signal was obtained for rs9262636 (P = 4.90 x 10(-9)) located in HCG22, which could again be replicated in an independent cohort. Taking advantage of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) as molecular phenotypes, we identified rs9262636 as an eQTL for several closely located genes encoding class I and class II major histocompatibility complex heavy chain receptors.

Conclusion The present study reveals a novel genetic susceptibility locus that clearly underlines the role of genetically driven, inflammatory processes in the pathogenesis of idiopathic DCM.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>35 (16), 1069-1077</Feld596><PubVol>35</PubVol><PubIss>16</PubIss><StrtPage>1069</StrtPage><EndPage>1077</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Meder M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Rühle F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Weis T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Homuth G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Franke J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Keller A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Huge A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Frese K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Peil B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Lorenzo J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Vogel B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Haas J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Witten A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Völker U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Ernst F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Teumer A, Ehlermann P, Zugck C, Friedrichs F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Kroemer H, Dörr M, Hoffmann W, Maisch B, Pankuweit S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Ruppert V, Scheffold T, Kühl U, Schultheiss H-P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Kreutz R, Ertl, G, Angrmann C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Charron P, Villard E, Gary F, Isnard R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Komajda M, Lutz M, Meittinger T, Sinner M, Wichmann H-E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Krawczak M, Ivandic B, Weichenhan D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="22" name="Gelbrich G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="El-Mokhtari N-E, Schreiber S, Felix S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Hasenfuß G, Pfeuffer A, Hübner N, Kääb S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Arbustini E, Rottbauer W, Frey N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Stoll, M, Katus HA."

However, it is unknown whether the improvements in survival have extended equally in all ethnic groups. Using data from the United States Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program, we assessed trends in survival and disease-related mortality for patients with myeloma by ethnic group, including non-Hispanic whites (nHw), AfricanAmericans (AA), Hispanics and people of Asian and Pacific Islander descent (API) from 1998-2001 to 2006-2009. Overall, age adjusted 5-year relative survival increased, from 35.6% in 1998-2001 to 44% in 2006-2009. The greatest improvements were observed for patients aged 15-49, for whom survival increased by + 16.8% units for nHw and + 14.4% units for AA, whereas improvement was less pronounced and not statistically significant in Hispanics and API. Excess mortality hazard ratios were 1.20 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.09-1.33) for AA and 1.25 (95% CI: 1.11-1.41) for Hispanics compared to nHw in 2006-2009. Although survival increased greatly for nHw with myeloma between 1998-2001 and 2006-2009, smaller increases were observed for people of other ethnic groups. Persistent excess mortality was seen for AA and Hispanic patients with myeloma. Ethnic inequalities persisted or even increased from earlier periods to 2006-2009. The results suggest that ethnic minorities may not have benefited from newer treatments to the same extent as nHw patients have.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>55 (5), 1083-1089</Feld596><PubVol>55</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>1083</StrtPage><EndPage>1089</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Pulte D."

Neuroimaging studies in schizophrenia patients have shown regional thinning of the cortical mantle, but it is unknown at present whether NSS are related to cortical thickness changes. Whole brain high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging at 3 Tesla was used to investigate cortical thickness in 28 patients with recent-onset schizophrenia. Cortical reconstruction was performed with the Freesurfer image analysis suite. NSS were examined on the Heidelberg Scale and related to cortical thickness. Age, education, and medication were considered as potential confounders. Higher NSS scores were associated with morphological changes of cortical thickness in multiple areas comprising paracentral gyrus, postcentral lobule, precuneus, inferior parietal lobule and temporal lobe. Our results confirm the hypothesis of a significant relationship between cortical thickness changes and the extent of NSS in schizophrenia. Investigation of cortical thickness may help to explain subtle motor symptoms such as NSS in schizophrenia.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>27 (2), 296-306</Feld596><PubVol>27</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>296</StrtPage><EndPage>306</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hirjak D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Wolf RC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Stieltjes B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Hauser T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Seidl U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Schroeder J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Thomann PA" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>23660871</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s10548-013-0292-z</DOI><KST>E010</KST><KST>E011</KST><KEYWORD>SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>1ST-EPISODE SCHIZOPHRENIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CEREBELLAR VOLUME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THICKNESS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>psychosis</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOTOR CORTEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BRAIN MORPHOLOGY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>41366</publishedID><Artikel>Colorectal Cancer</Artikel><Journal>Lancet</Journal><ABSTr>More than 1.2 million patients are diagnosed with colorectal cancer every year, and more than 600 000 die from the disease. Incidence strongly varies globally and is closely linked to elements of a so-called western lifestyle. Incidence is higher in men than women and strongly increases with age; median age at diagnosis is about 70 years in developed countries. Despite strong hereditary components, most cases of colorectal cancer are sporadic and develop slowly over several years through the adenoma-carcinoma sequence. The cornerstones of therapy are surgery, neoadjuvant radiotherapy (for patients with rectal cancer), and adjuvant chemotherapy (for patients with stage III/IV and high-risk stage II colon cancer). 5-year relative survival ranges from greater than 90% in patients with stage I disease to slightly greater than 10% in patients with stage IV disease. Screening has been shown to reduce colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, but organised screening programmes are still to be implemented in most countries.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>383 (9927), 1490-1502</Feld596><PubVol>383</PubVol><PubIss>9927</PubIss><StrtPage>1490</StrtPage><EndPage>1502</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Brenner H."

These techniques can also be used to image other nuclei with short relaxation times (e.g., K-39, Cl-35, O-17). Twisted projection imaging, density-adapted 3D projection reconstruction, and 3D cones are preferred because of uniform k-space sampling and ultra-short echo times. Sampling density weighted apodization can be applied if intrinsic filtering is desired. This approach leads to an increased signal-to-noise ratio compared to postfiltered acquisition in cases of short readout durations relative to T (2) (*) relaxation time. Different MR approaches for anisotropic resolution are presented, which are important for imaging of thin structures such as myocardium, cartilage, and skin.

It positively controls angiogenesis by regulating Vegfa as well as the transcriptional regulator Cbfb and its target Mmp13. In line with these findings, it has been demonstrated that tumor cell-derived JUNB promotes tumor growth and angiogenesis. In contrast to JUNB's function in tumor cells, the role of host-derived stromal JUNB has not been elucidated so far. Here, we show that ablation of Junb in stromal cells including endothelial cells (ECs), vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and fibroblasts does not affect tumor growth in two different syngeneic mouse models, the B16-F1 melanoma and the Lewis lung carcinoma model. In-depth analyses of the tumors revealed that tumor angiogenesis remains unaffected as assessed by measurements of the microvascular density and relative blood volume in the tumor. Furthermore, we could show that the maturation status of the tumor vasculature, analyzed by the SMC marker expression, -smooth muscle actin and Desmin, as well as the attachment of pericytes to the endothelium, is not changed upon ablation of Junb. Taken together, these results indicate that the pro-angiogenic functions of stromal JUNB are well compensated with regard to tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth.

What's new? JUNB is a subunit of the AP-1 transcription factor and a critical activator of Vegfa, the master regulator of angiogenesis. Here, the authors used conditional Junb knockout mice to define the role of stromal JUNB on tumor growth and angiogenesis. Surprisingly, although tumor-derived JUNB is known to critically regulate these properties, stromal, host-derived JUNB is dispensable for these processes. The study indicates that loss of stromal JUNB is well compensated by the tumor itself as well as infiltrating immune cells that provide pro-angiogenic factors and matrix metalloproteinases otherwise induced by JUNB expression in the tumor microenvironment.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>134 (6), 1511-1516</Feld596><PubVol>134</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>1511</StrtPage><EndPage>1516</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Braun,J."

We aimed to illustrate and quantify an often-overlooked bias that may occur in such studies if CRC mortality in the general population is not restricted by the date of diagnosis (whereas screening participants by definition do not have a prior CRC diagnosis).

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We illustrate and quantify the expected bias using cancer registry data from the United States.

RESULTS: Unless an incidence-based mortality approach is used, expected numbers of CRC deaths in screening cohorts (and hence estimated screening effects) are substantially overestimated. Overestimation of expected CRC deaths is most severe (more than fivefold) during the first year of follow-up and rapidly decreases in the subsequent years. Nevertheless, overestimation of 5- and 10-year cumulative numbers of expected CRC deaths is still as high as 60-70% and 20-30%, respectively. Substantial bias even persists if the initial years of follow-up are excluded from the analyses.

CONCLUSION: Careful restriction of expected CRC deaths by an incidence-based mortality approach is indispensable for deriving valid screening effect estimates.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>67 (2), 184-189</Feld596><PubVol>67</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>184</StrtPage><EndPage>189</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Hoffmeister M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Jansen L" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24210777</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.jclinepi.2013.08.017</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>DEATH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BREAST-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURVEILLANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>UNITED-STATES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SEER program</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AMERICAN-COLLEGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>sigmoidoscopy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>colonoscopy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENDOSCOPY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>41838</publishedID><Artikel>A novel culture device for the evaluation of three-dimensional extracellular matrix materials</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine</Journal><ABSTr>Cell-matrix interactions in a three-dimensional (3D) extracellular matrix (ECM) are of fundamental importance in living tissue, and their in vitro reconstruction in bioartificial structures represents a core target of contemporary tissue engineering concepts. For a detailed analysis of cell-matrix interaction under highly controlled conditions, we developed a novel ECM evaluation culture device (EECD) that allows for a precisely defined surface-seeding of 3D ECM scaffolds, irrespective of their natural geometry. The effectiveness of EECD was evaluated in the context of heart valve tissue engineering. Detergent decellularized pulmonary cusps were mounted in EECD and seeded with endothelial cells (ECs) to study EC adhesion, morphology and function on a 3D ECM after 3, 24, 48 and 96 h. Standard EC monolayers served as controls. Exclusive top-surface-seeding of 3D ECM by viable ECs was demonstrated by laser scanning microscopy (LSM), resulting in a confluent re-endothelialization of the ECM after 96 h. Cell viability and protein expression, as demonstrated by MTS assay and western blot analysis (endothelial nitric oxide synthase, von Willebrand factor), were preserved at maintained levels over time. In conclusion, EECD proves as a highly effective system for a controlled repopulation and in vitro analysis of cell-ECM interactions in 3D ECM.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>8 (9), 673-681</Feld596><PubVol>8</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>673</StrtPage><EndPage>681</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Akhyari,P."

Observational studies have suggested that colonoscopies strongly reduce the risk of CRC, but there is little specific evidence on the effects of screening colonoscopies. METHODS: We performed a population-based case-control study of 3148 patients with a first diagnosis of CRC (cases) and 3274 subjects without CRC (controls) from the Rhine-Neckar region of Germany from 2003 to 2010. Detailed information on previous colonoscopy and potential confounding factors was collected by standardized personal interviews. Self-reported information on colonoscopies and their indications was validated by medical records. We used multiple logistic regression to assess the association between colonoscopy conducted for specific indications within the past 10 years and risk of CRC. RESULTS: A history of colonoscopy was associated with a reduced subsequent risk of CRC, independently of the indication for the examination. However, somewhat stronger associations were found for examinations with screening indications (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.07-0.13) than for examinations with diagnostic indications, such as positive fecal occult blood test result (OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.19-0.57), surveillance after a preceding colonoscopy (OR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.24-0.45), rectal bleeding (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.20-0.40), abdominal symptoms (OR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.10-0.21), or other (OR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.14-0.30). Colonoscopy was also associated with a reduced risk of cancer in the right colon, regardless of the indication, although to a smaller extent than for other areas of the colon (OR for screening colonoscopy, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.14-0.33). CONCLUSIONS: In a population-based case-control study, the risk of CRC was strongly reduced up to 10 years after colonoscopy for any indication. Risk was particularly low after screening colonoscopy, even for cancer in the right colon.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>146 (3), 709-717</Feld596><PubVol>146</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>709</StrtPage><EndPage>717</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Chang-Claude J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Jansen L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Knebel P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Stock C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hoffmeister M" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24012982</PMID><DOI>10.1053/j.gastro.2013.09.001</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KST>C070</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>PROTECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DEATH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MORTALITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EFFICACY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>prevention</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>sigmoidoscopy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POLYPECTOMY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENDOSCOPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>42130</publishedID><Artikel>Development and validation of a scoring system to identify individuals at high risk for advanced colorectal neoplasms who should undergo colonoscopy screening</Artikel><Journal>Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Screening the population for colorectal cancer (CRC) by colonoscopy could reduce the disease burden. However, targeted screening of individuals at high risk could increase its cost effectiveness.

METHODS: We developed a scoring system to identify individuals with at least 1 advanced adenoma, based on easy-to-collect risk factors among 7891 participants of the German screening colonoscopy program. The system was validated in an independent sample of 3519 participants. Multiple logistic regression was used to develop the algorithm, and the regression coefficient-based scores were used to determine individual risks. Relative risk and numbers of colonoscopies needed for detecting one or more advanced neoplasm(s) were calculated for quintiles of the risk score. The predictive ability of the scoring system was quantified by the area under the curve.

RESULTS: We identified 9 risk factors (sex, age, first-degree relatives with a history of CRC, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, red meat consumption, ever regular use [at least 2 times/wk for at least 1 y] of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, previous colonoscopy, and previous detection of polyps) that were associated significantly with risk of advanced neoplasms. The developed score was associated strongly with the presence of advanced neoplasms. In the validation sample, individuals in the highest quintile of scores had a relative risk for advanced neoplasm of 3.86 (95% confidence interval, 2.71-5.49), compared with individuals in the lowest quintile. The number needed to screen to detect 1 or more advanced neoplasm(s) varied from 20 to 5 between quintiles of the risk score. In the validation sample, the scoring system identified patients with CRC or any advanced neoplasm with area under the curve values of 0.68 and 0.66, respectively.

CONCLUSIONS: We developed a scoring system, based on easy-to-collect risk factors, to identify individuals most likely to have advanced neoplasms. This system might be used to stratify individuals for CRC screening.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>12 (3), 478-485</Feld596><PubVol>12</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>478</StrtPage><EndPage>485</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Tao S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Hoffmeister M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24022090</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.cgh.2013.08.042</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>PROGRAM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OCCULT BLOOD-TESTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADENOMA DETECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HARVARD CANCER-RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PREDICTION TOOL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>prevention</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EFFICACY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INDEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POPULATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>42353</publishedID><Artikel>Long noncoding RNA HOTTIP/HOXA13 expression is associated with disease progression and predicts outcome in hepatocellular carcinoma patients</Artikel><Journal>Hepatology</Journal><ABSTr>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the leading causes of cancer-related death. Despite the advances in diagnosis and management of HCC, the biology of this tumor remains poorly understood. Recent evidence highlighted long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as crucial determinants of HCC development. In this study we report the lncRNA HOXA transcript at the distal tip (HOTTIP) as significantly up-regulated in HCC specimens. The HOTTIP gene is located in physical contiguity with HOXA13 and directly controls the HOXA locus gene expression by way of interaction with the WDR5/MLL complex. HOX genes encode transcription factors regulating embryonic development and cell fate. We previously described HOX genes deregulation to be involved in hepatocarcinogenesis. Indeed, we observed the marked up-regulation of HOXA13 in HCC. Here, by correlating clinicopathological and expression data, we demonstrate that the levels of HOTTIP and HOXA13 are associated with HCC patients' clinical progression and predict disease outcome. In contrast to the majority of similar studies, our data were obtained from snap-frozen needle HCC biopsies (n=52) matched with their nonneoplastic counterparts collected from patients who had not yet received any HCC-tailored therapeutic treatments at the time of biopsy. In addition, taking advantage of gain and loss of function experiments in liver cancer-derived cell lines (HuH-6 and HuH-7), we uncover a novel bidirectional regulatory loop between HOTTIP/HOXA13. Conclusion: Our study highlights the key role of HOTTIP and HOXA13 in HCC development by associating their expression with metastasis and survival in HCC patients, provides novel insights on the function of lncRNA-driven hepatocarcinogenesis, and paves the way for further investigation about the possible role of HOTTIP as a predictive biomarker of HCC.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>59 (3), 911-923</Feld596><PubVol>59</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>911</StrtPage><EndPage>923</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Quagliata, L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Matter, MS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Piscuoglio, S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Arabi, L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Ruiz, C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Procino, A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Kovac, M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Moretti, F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Makowska, Z" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Boldanova, T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Andersen, JB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Haemmerle, M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Tornillo, L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Heim, MH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Diederichs, S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Cillo, C*" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Terracciano, LM*" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24114970</PMID><DOI>10.1002/hep.26740</DOI><KST>B150</KST><KEYWORD>PROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CARCINOGENESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VITRO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHOGENESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHROMATIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Homeobox</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIVER-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Hox genes</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HOTAIR</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>42449</publishedID><Artikel>Infant atopic eczema and subsequent attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder - a prospective birth cohort study</Artikel><Journal>Pediatric Allergy and Immunology</Journal><ABSTr>BackgroundComorbidity between childhood atopic eczema (AE) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been observed, but temporal relationships remain unclear.

MethodsWe analyzed data of a population-based, prospective birth cohort study among 770 children included at baseline in 2000/2001 with follow-up up to age 11. Information on age at diagnosis of AE, rhinoconjunctivitis, and ADHD was obtained by questionnaires administered to parents and for AE also to caring physicians. Adjusted relative risks (aRR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were modeled with a modified Poisson regression.

ResultsEarly AE up to age 4yr was reported for 14.8% of the children by the parents and for 26.0% by the physicians with only fair agreement between these reports (kappa=0.36). Based on parental reports, the association of early AE with early ADHD was strong (aRR: 5.17, 95% CI: 2.18; 12.28), but absent for late ADHD [aRR: 0.50 (0.13; 2.02)]. The association of late AE with late ADHD [aRR: 3.03 (0.75; 12.29)] was not statistically significant. This pattern was independent of the presence of rhinoconjunctivitis.

ConclusionsThe observed comorbidity between AE and ADHD may indicate vulnerability to develop ADHD symptoms in response to AE symptoms or through a common underlying mechanism. This vulnerability seems to decrease with time since AE onset and may be greater in early life. These temporal relationships should be considered in future research investigating mechanisms linking both diseases and in clinical efforts to screen for and prevent ADHD symptoms in children with AE.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>25 (1), 51-56</Feld596><PubVol>25</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>51</StrtPage><EndPage>56</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Genuneit J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Braig S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Brandt S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Wabitsch M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Florath I" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Rothenbacher D" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24289041</PMID><DOI>10.1111/pai.12152</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>MENTAL-HEALTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DERMATITIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHILDHOOD</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMORBIDITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADHD</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GERMAN HEALTH INTERVIEW</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADOLESCENTS KIGGS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PREVALENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHILDREN</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>42757</publishedID><Artikel>Improved population level survival in younger Hodgkin lymphoma patients in Germany in the early 21st century</Artikel><Journal>British Journal of Haematology</Journal><ABSTr>Treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is more aggressive in Germany than in the United States (US) and differences in treatment may lead to differences in population level survival.

Their role in the tumor cells and in tumor progression is largely unclear. We established a prostate cancer epithelial cell line (PC-3 TO-A8/A9) expressing S100A8 and S100A9 simultaneously under doxycycline control, to study the role of S100A8/A9 on tumor growth and infiltration of immune cells in subcutaneous xenografts in male NMRI nu/nu mice. Colonization of distant organs was studied after intracardial injection of the tumor cells in male NOD/SCID mice. PC-3 TO-A8/A9 cells grown in vitro and subcutaneous xenografts in mice not treated with doxycycline expressed high levels of S100A8/A9 mRNA and protein, whereas doxycycline treatment suppressed S100A8/A9 expression. S100A8/A9 expression did not significantly alter growth rate and invasion of the subcutaneous tumors into surrounding tissues. However, S100A8/A9 expression caused increased infiltration of immune cells, especially neutrophils. In intracardially injected mice sporadic tumor settlement was observed in muscle and lymph nodes. Colonies of tumor cells and micro-metastases were observed in the lung of 64.3% (9 out of 14) of mice not treated with doxycycline and in 33.3% (5 out of 15) of mice treated with doxycycline. Our data demonstrate for the first time that S100A8/A9 expression in epithelial cancer cells causes enhanced infiltration of immune cells, especially neutrophils, and stimulates settlement of the cancer cells in the lung.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>229 (5), 661-671</Feld596><PubVol>229</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>661</StrtPage><EndPage>671</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Grebhardt,S."

Due to the anatomy of the heart, a substantial but unintended partial inversion of the inflowing blood occurs during the slice-selective inversion. Both, the partial inversion as well as the Look-Locker pulse train, influence the myocardial perfusion quantification and are addressed in this work.

METHODS: The mean relaxation time approximation is used to calculate the monoexponential relaxation time of the signal in perfused tissue under Look-Locker readout. The left ventricular blood serves as an approximation of the inflowing blood in the description of FAIR-ASL measurements with global and slice-selective inversion to correctly quantify the myocardial perfusion.

RESULTS: The analysis shows that the myocardial perfusion can be overestimated if the T1 -based quantification method is not adapted respecting the Look-Locker pulse train explicitly. Additionally, it turns out that without correction for the partial inversion of the blood pool during the slice-selective inversion the myocardial perfusion is underestimated.

CONCLUSION: It is shown that the Look-Locker readout as well as the nonideal slice-selective inversion experiment have a considerable influence and have to be included properly to correctly quantify myocardial perfusion.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>71 (5), 1784-1797</Feld596><PubVol>71</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>1784</StrtPage><EndPage>1797</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kampf,T."

Results on prevalence, determinants, and the association with quality of life and depression from the Cancer Survivorship - a multi-regional population-based study</Artikel><Journal>Psycho-Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>BackgroundFear of recurrence (FoR) is a widespread problem among breast cancer survivors. So far, little is known about prevalence, determinants, and consequences of FoR specifically in long-term breast cancer survivors, even though it was found to be one of the most important concerns in this group.

MethodsAnalyses are based on data of several population-based cohorts of long-term breast cancer survivors, recruited by six German cancer registries. Overall, 2671 women were included in the analyses. FoR was assessed using the short form of the Fear of Progression Questionnaire. Potential determinants of moderate/high FoR and the association with depression and quality of life (QoL) were explored via multiple logistic and linear regression.

ResultsEven though the majority of women reported low levels of FoR (82%), a substantial percentage experienced moderate (11%) and high (6%) FoR. Younger age (odds ratio=3.00, confidence intervals=1.91-4.73 for women below age 55years) and considering oneself as a tumor patient (odds ratio=3.36, confidence intervals=2.66-4.25) were found to exhibit the strongest associations with moderate/high FoR. Overall, psychosocial and sociodemographic factors played a far bigger role in FoR than clinical factors. Higher FoR was associated with higher depression and lower QoL.

ConclusionFear of recurrence (mostly low levels) is highly prevalent among long-term breast cancer survivors and can negatively affect QoL and well-being. Therefore, it should be given appropriate consideration in research and clinical practice. As specifically younger women tended to be impacted by FoR, it is crucial to be particularly attentive to specific needs of younger survivors.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (5), 547-554</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>547</StrtPage><EndPage>554</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Koch L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Bertram H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Eberle A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Holleczek B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schmid-Hoepfner S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Waldmann A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Zeissig S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Arndt V" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24293081</PMID><DOI>10.1002/pon.3452</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>PROGRESSION QUESTIONNAIRE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EUROPEAN-ORGANIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SCALE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADULT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AFRICAN-AMERICAN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Mastectomy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMMUNICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>validation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTERVENTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>UNCERTAINTY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>43155</publishedID><Artikel>Men with negative results of guaiac based fecal occult blood test have higher prevalences of colorectal neoplasms than women with positive results</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Guaiac-based fecal occult blood tests (gFOBTs) are the most commonly applied tests for colorectal cancer screening globally but have relatively poor sensitivity to detect colorectal neoplasms. Men have higher prevalences of colorectal neoplasms than women. In case of a positive gFOBT result, participants are referred to colonoscopy, independent of sex. To assess performance of gFOBT in routine screening practice, we assessed age and sex specific prevalences (age groups: 55-59, 60-64, 65-69 and 70-74) of colorectal neoplasms in 182,956 women and men undergoing colonoscopy for primary screening and in 20,884 women and men undergoing colonoscopy to follow-up a positive gFOBT in Bavaria, Germany, in 2007-2009. We conducted model calculations to estimate prevalences among gFOBT negative individuals. Analogous model calculations were performed for women and men tested positive or negative with fecal immunochemical tests. In all age groups (55-59, 60-64, 65-69 and 70-74 years), men undergoing colonoscopy for primary screening had substantially higher prevalences of any colorectal neoplasms and essentially the same prevalences of advanced colorectal neoplasms compared to women undergoing colonoscopy to follow-up a positive gFOBT. Model calculations suggest that men with negative gFOBT likewise have substantially higher prevalences of colorectal neoplasms than gFOBT positive women in each age group. Model calculations further indicate that no such sex paradoxon occurs, and a much clearer risk stratification can be achieved with fecal immunochemical tests. Our findings underline need to move forward from and overcome shortcomings of gFOBT-based colorectal cancer screening.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>134 (12), 2927-2934</Feld596><PubVol>134</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>2927</StrtPage><EndPage>2934</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Hoffmeister M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Birkner B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Stock C" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24374771</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28618</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>PERFORMANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POPULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MORTALITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FOLLOW-UP</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADENOMA DETECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SCREENING COLONOSCOPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METAANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AVERAGE-RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMMUNOCHEMICAL TESTS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>43161</publishedID><Artikel>Cross-sectional and longitudinal changes in DNA methylation with age: An epigenome-wide analysis revealing over 60 novel age-associated CpG sites</Artikel><Journal>Human Molecular Genetics</Journal><ABSTr>Understanding the role of epigenetic modifications, e. g.

We analysed &gt; 480 000 CpG sites using Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina) in whole blood DNA of 965 participants of a population-based cohort study aged between 50 and 75 years. In an exploratory analysis in 400 individuals, 200 CpG sites with the highest Spearman correlation coefficients for the association between methylation and age were identified. Of these 200 CpGs, 162 were significantly associated with age, which was verified in an independent cohort of 498 individuals using mixed linear regression models adjusted for gender, smoking behaviour, age-related diseases and random batch effect and corrected for multiple testing by Bonferroni. In another independent cohort of 67 individuals without history of major age-related diseases and with a follow-up of 8 years, we observed a gain in methylation at 96% (52%, significant) of the positively age-associated CpGs and a loss at all (89%, significant) of the negatively age-associated CpGs in each individual while getting 8 years older. A regression model for age prediction based on 17 CpGs as predicting variables explained 71% of the variance in age with an average accuracy of 2.6 years. In comparison with cord blood samples obtained from the Ulm Birth Cohort Study, we observed a more than 2-fold change in mean methylation levels from birth to older age at 86 CpGs. We were able to identify 65 novel CpG sites with significant association of methylation with age.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (5), 1186-1201</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>1186</StrtPage><EndPage>1201</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Florath I" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Butterbach K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Mueller H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Bewerunge-Hudler M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24163245</PMID><DOI>10.1093/hmg/ddt531</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>BIRTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>human brain</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ROLES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ARRAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIFE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HYPERMETHYLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STEM-CELLS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>43228</publishedID><Artikel>Genome-wide analysis associates familial colorectal cancer with increases in copy number variations and a rare structural variation at 12p12.3</Artikel><Journal>Carcinogenesis</Journal><ABSTr>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancer worldwide. However, a large number of genetic risk factors involved in CRC have not been understood. Copy number variations (CNVs) might partly contribute to the missing heritability of CRC. An increased overall burden of CNV has been identified in several complex diseases, whereas the association between the overall CNV burden and CRC risk is largely unknown. We performed a genome-wide investigation of CNVs on genomic DNA from 384 familial CRC cases and 1285 healthy controls by the Affymetrix 6.0 array. An increase of overall CNV burden was observed in familial CRC patients compared with healthy controls, especially for CNVs larger than 50kb (case/control ratio 1.66, P 0.025). In addition, we discovered for the first time a novel structural variation at 12p12.3 and determined the breakpoints by strategic PCR and sequencing. This 12p12.3 structural variation was found in four of 2862 CRC cases but not in 6243 healthy controls (P 0.0098). RERGL gene (RERG/RAS-like), the only gene influenced by the 12p12.3 structural variation, sharing most of the conserved regions with its close family member RERG tumor suppressor gene (RAS-like, estrogen-regulated, growth inhibitor), might be a novel CRC-related gene. In conclusion, this is the first study to reveal the contribution of the overall burden of CNVs to familial CRC risk and identify a novel rare structural variation at 12p12.3 containing RERGL gene to be associated with CRC.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>35 (2), 315-323</Feld596><PubVol>35</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>315</StrtPage><EndPage>323</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Yang R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Chen B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Pfuetze K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Buch S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Steinke V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Holinski-Feder E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Stoecker S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Schoenfels W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Becker T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Schackert HK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Royer-Pokora B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Kloor M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Schmiegel WH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Buettner R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="14" name="Engel C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Lascorz Puertolas J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="16" name="Foersti A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="17" name="Kunkel N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="18" name="Bugert P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Schreiber S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Krawczak M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Schafmayer C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Propping P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Hampe J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Hemminki K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="25" name="Burwinkel B" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24127187</PMID><DOI>10.1093/carcin/bgt344</DOI><KST>C050</KST><KST>G105</KST><KST>C080</KST><KEYWORD>SCHIZOPHRENIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POPULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MECHANISM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMPLEX DISEASES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REARRANGEMENTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>susceptibility loci</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MISSING HERITABILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHROMOSOMAL DELETIONS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>43229</publishedID><Artikel>Age-time risk patterns of solid cancers in 60,901 non-Hodgkin lymphoma survivors from Finland, Norway and Sweden</Artikel><Journal>British Journal of Haematology</Journal><ABSTr>Survival after non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) has increased thanks to improved treatment but NHL survivors have an increased risk of second neoplasms. The assessment of cancer risk patterns after NHL may help to quantify the late side-effects of therapy. Poisson regression was used to estimate relative risks (RRs) and absolute incidence rates for nine solid tumours based on a nationwide cohort of 60 901 NHL survivors from Finland, Norway and Sweden. Patients were diagnosed between 1980 and 2006 and developed 6815 s neoplasms. NHL patients showed an increased risk of each of the nine investigated cancer sites: prostate and pancreas (both RRs 1.28), breast (1.37), colorectum (1.48), urinary bladder (1.52), stomach and lung (both RRs 1.87), skin (melanoma 2.27) and kidney (2.56). The RRs showed a U-shaped relationship with time after NHL for all nine-second cancer types. NHL diagnosis early in life was a risk factor for the development of second cancers with the exception of melanoma, but a risk excess was even observed in patients diagnosed with NHL at age 80+ years. The present study provides accurate estimates on the adverse late effects of NHL therapy, which should guide the establishment of cancer prevention strategies in NHL survivors.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>164 (5), 675-683</Feld596><PubVol>164</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>675</StrtPage><EndPage>683</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Bermejo JL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Pukkala E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Johannesen TB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Sundquist J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Hemminki K" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24528128</PMID><DOI>10.1111/bjh.12684</DOI><KST>C050</KST><KEYWORD>2ND MALIGNANCY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MALIGNANT NEOPLASMS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BRITISH COHORT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHILDHOOD</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REGISTRY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>leukemia</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LONG-TERM SURVIVORS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>43264</publishedID><Artikel>Adult height and head and neck cancer: a pooled analysis within the INHANCE Consortium</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Epidemiology</Journal><ABSTr>Several epidemiological studies have shown a positive association between adult height and cancer incidence. The only study conducted among women on mouth and pharynx cancer risk, however, reported an inverse association. This study aims to investigate the association between height and the risk of head and neck cancer (HNC) within a large international consortium of HNC. We analyzed pooled individual-level data from 24 case-control studies participating in the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology Consortium. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated separately for men and women for associations between height and HNC risk. Educational level, tobacco smoking, and alcohol consumption were included in all regression models. Stratified analyses by HNC subsites were performed. This project included 17,666 cases and 28,198 controls. We found an inverse association between height and HNC (adjusted OR per 10 cm height = 0.91, 95 % CI 0.86-0.95 for men; adjusted OR = 0.86, 95 % CI 0.79-0.93 for women). In men, the estimated OR did vary by educational level, smoking status, geographic area, and control source. No differences by subsites were detected. Adult height is inversely associated with HNC risk. As height can be considered a marker of childhood illness and low energy intake, the inverse association is consistent with prior studies showing that HNC occur more frequently among deprived individuals. Further studies designed to elucidate the mechanism of such association would be warranted.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>29 (1), 35-48</Feld596><PubVol>29</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>35</StrtPage><EndPage>48</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Leoncini E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Ricciardi W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Cadoni G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Arzani D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Petrelli L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Paludetti G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Brennan P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Luce D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Stucker I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Matsuo K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Talamini R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="La Vecchia C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Olshan AF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Winn DM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Herrero R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Franceschi S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Castellsague X" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Muscat J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Morgenstern H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Zhang ZF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Levi F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Dal Maso L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Kelsey K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="McClean M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Vaughan TL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Lazarus P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Purdue MP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Hayes RB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Chen C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Schwartz SM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Shangina O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Koifman S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Ahrens W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Matos E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Lagiou P Lissowska J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Szeszenia-Dabrowska N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Fernandez L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Menezes A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Agudo A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Daudt AW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Richiardi L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Kjaerheim K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Mates D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Betka J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="44" name="Yu GP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="45" name="Schantz S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="46" name="Simonato L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="47" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="48" name="Conway DI" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="49" name="Macfarlane TV" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="50" name="Thomson P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="51" name="Fabianova E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="52" name="Znaor A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="53" name="Rudnai P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="54" name="Healy C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="55" name="Boffetta P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="56" name="Chuang SC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="57" name="Lee YC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="58" name="Hashibe M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="59" name="Boccia S" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24271556</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s10654-013-9863-2</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>WOMEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COHORT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK-FACTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BODY-MASS INDEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METAANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SECULAR TRENDS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CARDIORESPIRATORY DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LEG LENGTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPIDEMIOLOGY CONSORTIUM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTERNATIONAL HEAD</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>43299</publishedID><Artikel>Prognostic significance of whole-body MRI in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance</Artikel><Journal>Leukemia</Journal><ABSTr>Radiological skeletal survey or computed tomography are currently applied to assess bone diseases in patients with monoclonal plasma cell disorders. Whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (whole-body MRI) allows detecting the infiltration of clonal cells in nearly the whole bone marrow compartment even before bone destruction has occurred. Those MRI results (i.e., patterns of bone marrow infiltration) have been demonstrated to be of prognostic significance in patients with symptomatic as well as asymptomatic multiple myeloma. We have therefore analyzed the findings of whole-body MRI in 137 consecutive individuals with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). A focal infiltration pattern was detected in 23.4% of patients. Presence and number of focal lesions as well as value of M-Protein were of independent prognostic significance for progression into a symptomatic disease requiring systemic treatment (P = 0.02; P&lt;0.0001 and P = 0.0005, respectively). Lower homogeneous signal intensities in T1-weighted images were related to a physiologically higher bone marrow cellularity in younger individuals (P = 0.002). We conclude that whole-body MRI identifies patients with focal accumulations of presumably monoclonal cells in bone marrow with prognostic impact concerning the risk of progression into symptomatic disease.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>28 (1), 174-178</Feld596><PubVol>28</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>174</StrtPage><EndPage>178</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hillengass,J."

Furthermore, no comprehensive analysis of socioeconomic differences in cancer survival in Germany has been conducted. Therefore, we analyzed variations in cancer survival for patients diagnosed with one of the 25 most common cancer sites in 1997-2006 in ten population-based cancer registries in Germany (covering 32 million inhabitants). Patients were assigned a socioeconomic status according to the district of residence at diagnosis. Period analysis was used to derive 3-month, 5-year and conditional 1-year and 5-year age-standardized relative survival for 2002-2006 for each deprivation quintile in Germany. Relative survival of patients living in the most deprived district was compared to survival of patients living in all other districts by model-based period analysis. For 21 of 25 cancer sites, 5-year relative survival was lower in the most deprived districts than in all other districts combined. The median relative excess risk of death over the 25 cancer sites decreased from 1.24 in the first 3 months to 1.16 in the following 9 months to 1.08 in the following 4 years. Inequalities persisted after adjustment for stage. These major regional socioeconomic inequalities indicate a potential for improving cancer care and survival in Germany. Studies on individual-level patient data with access to treatment information should be conducted to examine the reasons for these socioeconomic inequalities in cancer survival in more detail.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>134 (12), 2951-2960</Feld596><PubVol>134</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>2951</StrtPage><EndPage>2960</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Jansen L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Eberle A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Emrich K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Gondos A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Holleczek B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Kajüter H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Maier W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Nennecke A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Pritzkuleit R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Brenner H for the GEKID Cancer Survival Working Group" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24259308</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28624</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INEQUALITIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIAGNOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MORTALITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POPULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PERIOD ANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATIENT SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENGLAND</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>UP-TO-DATE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REGIONAL DEPRIVATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>43326</publishedID><Artikel>Effect of a Detailed Family History of Melanoma on Risks of Other Tumors: A Cohort Study Based on the Nationwide Swedish Family-Cancer Database</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Investigative Dermatology</Journal><ABSTr>Using the Swedish Family-Cancer Database, we assessed the effect of a detailed family history of melanoma on risk for other tumors (other than melanoma). Among 248,011 individuals with a family history of melanoma, 43,931 other tumors were diagnosed from 1958 to 2010. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for other tumors in patients who had a family history of melanoma, as compared with those without. A detailed family history of melanoma was investigated according to an increasing number of melanomas in either 1 or &gt;= 2 first-degree relatives (FDRs). Associations were considered significant when there were at least two independently significant SIRs or a statistically significant trend of increasing SIRs with increasing number of melanomas in relatives. The applied criteria for significant associations were convincingly met by pancreatic, breast, prostate, and squamous cell skin tumors and ependymoma, although there was significant but not overwhelming evidence for thyroid, parathyroid, lung, and unknown primary tumors, meningioma, mycosis fungoides, and myeloid leukemia. To our knowledge, no studies have previously considered a detailed family history of melanoma and the use of internal validation to assess familial associations of melanoma with other tumors. We established associations for 12 other tumors, and the associations for myeloid leukemia, parathyroid, and unknown primary tumors are, to our knowledge, previously unreported.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>134 (4), 930-936</Feld596><PubVol>134</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>930</StrtPage><EndPage>936</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Chen T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Fallah M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kharazmi E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Ji J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Sundquist K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hemminki K" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24192716</PMID><DOI>10.1038/jid.2013.460</DOI><KST>C050</KST><KEYWORD>DYSPLASTIC NEVUS SYNDROME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FAMMM SYNDROME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SPECTRUM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CUTANEOUS MALIGNANT-MELANOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SKIN-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MYCOSIS-FUNGOIDES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUSCEPTIBILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>carcinoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>germline mutations</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BREAST</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>43327</publishedID><Artikel>Outcome of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer depends on the primary tumor site (midgut vs. hindgut): analysis of the FIRE1-trial (FuFIRI or mIROX as first-line treatment)</Artikel><Journal>Anti-Cancer Drugs</Journal><ABSTr>he aim of this study was to investigate the impact of midgut versus hindgut as the primary tumor site in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) receiving chemotherapy with FuFIRI or mIROX. We analyzed 423 patients from a phase III trial that randomized patients in a 1 : 1 fashion to either FuFIRI or mIROX. The cohort was grouped into midgut (n=82) and hindgut (n=341) primary tumors. The primary tumor site (midgut vs. hindgut) was correlated with parameters of treatment efficacy and survival. Our cohort comprised 82 patients presenting with primary midgut tumors and 341 with primary hindgut tumors. Tumors of midgut origin compared with hindgut origin were associated with inferior outcome. Objective response rate was 37 versus 43% (P=0.34), median progression-free survival was 6.0 versus 8.2 months (P=0.024, hazard ratio: 0.75), and median overall survival was 13.6 versus 21.8 months (P=0.001, hazard ratio: 0.65). Patients with midgut mCRC showed a clear trend toward inferior outcome in both study arms. However, the effect appeared less pronounced in the mIROX arm. Further datasets from large trials with various regimens are required as confirmation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>25 (2), 212-218</Feld596><PubVol>25</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>212</StrtPage><EndPage>218</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Modest, D.P."

The world-wide epidemiology of KS has changed by spreading of HIV infection (1). For example, KS represented 7% of all cancers in Sub-Saharan African men in the 1960s, whereas in the 1980s the rate increased to 50%. Furthermore, the age distribution of KS has changed from elderly (in classic form) to the late thirties (in epidemic form). KS is a rare tumour in Nordic countries; the incidence is 0.1-0.2/100,000 according to the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents (CI5) report (3). According to this source, the rate in many Asian countries is &lt;0.5/100,000, whereas African American men have a rate of 6.2/100,000. The highest rate is in men from Zimbabwe (52.2/100,000) (3). Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) is the recognised cause of all forms of KS (2). There is discrepancy between the prevalence of HHV-8 and KS incidence in some populations suggesting underreporting of KS or the existance of some unknown protective factors for KS (1). Migrant studies provide data on international differences in cancer rates (4). Furthermore, studies on immigrants may provide supplementary and confirmatory data on the incidence of cancer in countries without local cancer registries. A few available studies on immigrants have focused only on classic KS (5, 6). In the present study, we report mean age at diagnosis and KS rates by site in first-generation immigrants to Sweden</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>94 (4), 476-477</Feld596><PubVol>94</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>476</StrtPage><EndPage>477</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Mousavi SM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Sundquist J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Hemminki K" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24212288</PMID><DOI>10.2340/00015555-1754</DOI><KST>C050</KST><KEYWORD>CANCER INCIDENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WORLDWIDE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPIDEMIOLOGY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POPULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INFECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIAGNOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PREVALENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MEN</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>43505</publishedID><Artikel>A genome-wide association study on copy-number variation identifies a 11q11 loss as a candidate susceptibility variant for colorectal cancer</Artikel><Journal>Human Genetics</Journal><ABSTr>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a complex disease, and therefore its development is determined by the combination of both environmental factors and genetic variants. Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of SNP variation have conveniently identified 20 genetic variants so far, a significant proportion of the observed heritability is yet to be explained. Common copy-number variants (CNVs) are one of the most important genomic sources of variability, and hence a potential source to explain part of this missing genetic fraction. Therefore, we have performed a GWAS on CNVs to explore the relationship between common structural variation and CRC development. Phase 1 of the GWAS consisted of 881 cases and 667 controls from a Spanish cohort. Copy-number status was validated by quantitative PCR for each of those common CNVs potentially associated with CRC in phase I. Subsequently, SNPs were chosen as proxies for the validated CNVs for phase II replication (1,342 Spanish cases and 1,874 Spanish controls). Four common CNVs were found to be associated with CRC and were further replicated in Phase II. Finally, we found that SNP rs1944682, tagging a 11q11 CNV, was nominally associated with CRC susceptibility (p value = 0.039; OR = 1.122). This locus has been previously related to extreme obesity phenotypes, which could suggest a relationship between body weight and CRC susceptibility.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>133 (5), 525-534</Feld596><PubVol>133</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>525</StrtPage><EndPage>534</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Fernandez-Rozadilla C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Cazier JB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Tomlinson I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Brea-Fernández A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Lamas MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Baiget M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="López-Fernández LA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Clofent J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Bujanda L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Gonzalez D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="de Castro L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="The EPICOLON Consortium" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Hemminki K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Bessa X" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Andreu M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Jover R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Xicola R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Llor X" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Moreno V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Castells A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Castellví-Bel S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Carracedo A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Ruiz-Ponte C" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24218287</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00439-013-1390-4</DOI><KST>C050</KST><KEYWORD>OBESITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHENOTYPES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACCURACY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SNPs</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHROMOSOMES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LOCI</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METAANALYSIS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>43611</publishedID><Artikel>Diagnostic performance of guaiac based fecal occult blood test in routine screening: state-wide analysis from Bavaria, Germany</Artikel><Journal>American Journal of Gastroenterology</Journal><ABSTr>OBJECTIVES: Randomized trials have shown that annual or biannual screening by guaiac-based fecal occult blood tests (gFOBTs) reduces colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality. Few clinical studies have evaluated diagnostic performance of gFOBT through validation by colonoscopy in all participants. We aimed for a comprehensive evaluation of diagnostic performance of gFOBT by age and sex under routine screening conditions.

METHODS: Our analysis is based on 20,884 colonoscopies following up a positive gFOBT and 182,956 primary screening colonoscopies documented in a state-wide quality assurance program in Bavaria, Germany, in 2007-2009. Positive likelihood ratios (LR+), which represent an integrative measure of diagnostic performance, were derived, by age groups (55-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70-74 years) and sex, from a joint and comparative analysis of prevalences of colorectal neoplasms in both groups.

RESULTS: Overall LR+ (95% confidence intervals) were 1.11 (1.06-1.15), 1.80 (1.72-1.88), and 5.04 (4.64-5.47) for non-advanced adenoma, advanced adenoma, and cancer, respectively. Assuming a specificity of gFOBT of 95.2%, as recently observed in a German study among 2,235 participants of screening colonoscopy, these LR+ would translate to sensitivities of 5.3%, 8.6%, and 24.2% for the three outcomes, respectively. Diagnostic performance was similarly poor among women and men and across age groups.

CONCLUSIONS: The performance of gFOBT under routine screening conditions is even worse than previously estimated from clinical studies. In routine screening application, gFOBTs are expected to miss more than 9 out of 10 advanced adenomas and 3 out of 4 cancers. These results underline the need and the potential for better noninvasive CRC screening tests.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>109 (3), 427-435</Feld596><PubVol>109</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>427</StrtPage><EndPage>435</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Hoffmeister M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Birkner B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Stock C" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24343548</PMID><DOI>10.1038/ajg.2013.424</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>METAANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AVERAGE-RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGRAM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>colonoscopy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POPULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FOLLOW-UP</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>sensitivity</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EUROPE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMMUNOCHEMICAL TESTS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>43662</publishedID><Artikel>The ZnR/GPR39 interacts with the CaSR to enhance signaling in prostate and salivary epithelia</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Cellular Physiology</Journal><ABSTr>Zinc signaling is mediated by the zinc sensing receptor, ZnR, recently suggested to be the same receptor as G-protein coupled receptor 39, GPR39. However it is unknown if GPR39 is mediating Zn2+-dependent
signaling in prostate and salivary tissue where changes in zinc concentrations are frequent and of physiological significance. Here, we show that GPR39 is mediating Zn2+-dependent Ca2+ responses and is regulating activity of MAP and PI3 pathways in prostate cancer cells, PC3, and ductal salivary gland cells, HSY. We next ask whether ZnR/GPR39 interacts with other GPCR family members. We find that endogenous ZnR/GPR39 activity is regulated by the expression and activity of another cation sensing GPCR, the Ca2+-sensing receptor (CaSR). Although CaSR is not activated by Zn2+, co-expression of CaSR and ZnR/GPR39 ynergistically
enhances Ca2+ responses in PC3 and HSY cells. Silencing of the CaSR using siRNA or a dominant negative construct reduces the Zn2+-dependent signaling. Importantly, overexpression of GPR39 in HEK293 cells is
sufficient to trigger Zn2+-dependent responses. Nevertheless, application of the CaSR agonist spermine, at concentration below its threshold, enhanced Zn2+-dependent Ca2+ response. Our results suggest that the CaSR interacts with ZnR/GPR39 and thereby regulates its activity. Finally, we show that in PC3 cells ZnR/GPR39 is required for mediating the Zn2+-dependent activation of MAPK and PI3K, pathways leading to enhanced cell growth. Importantly, Zn2+-dependent activation of ZnR/GPR39 also enhances the expression of the Ca2+- binding protein S100A4 that is linked to invasion of prostate cancer cells.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>229 (7), 868-877</Feld596><PubVol>229</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>868</StrtPage><EndPage>877</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Asraf,H."

However, there has been no comprehensive evaluation of autoimmune diseases among patients who develop different subtypes of hepatobiliary cancer. We examined the association between autoimmune diseases and cancers of the liver and biliary tract in the Swedish population METHODS: We analyzed data from national datasets at the Center for Primary Health Care Research (Lund University, Sweden). Data on patients with autoimmune disorders were retrieved from the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register, from 1964 through 2008; 33 diseases were evaluated. Hepatobiliary cancer cases were retrieved from the Swedish Cancer Registry. We calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and hazard ratios for incident cancers and deaths from hepatobiliary cancers.

RESULTS: Among 402,462 patients with autoimmune disorders, 582 were diagnosed with primary liver cancer, 330 with gallbladder cancer, 115 with extrahepatic bile duct cancer, and 43 with ampulla of Vater cancers. We identified 14 autoimmune conditions that were significantly associated with increased risk of primary liver cancer (overall SIR [any autoimmune disease], 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0-2.3), 5 conditions associated with gallbladder cancer (overall SIR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.4), and 3 associated with extrahepatic bile duct cancer (overall SIR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.3-1.9) The autoimmune disorders with the strongest association with primary liver cancer were primary biliary cirrhosis (SIR, 39.5; 95% CI, 28.2-53.8) and autoimmune hepatitis (SIR, 29.0; 95% CI, 9.1-68.2); ulcerative colitis was strongly associated with extrahepatic bile duct cancer (SIR, 5.6; 95% CI, 3.6-8.4). Celiac disease, Crohn's disease, systemic sclerosis, and ulcerative colitis were associated with at least 2 types of cancer. Increased hazard ratios were observed only for patients with biliary tract cancer who had been hospitalized for autoimmune conditions.

CONCLUSIONS: In a study of the Swedish population, we identified an increased risk of hepatobiliary cancers among individuals diagnosed with autoimmune disease. Associations among different cancer types indicate that shared immunomodulatory mechanisms determine susceptibility to hepatobiliary cancer.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>12 (6), 1038-1045</Feld596><PubVol>12</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>1038</StrtPage><EndPage>1045</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Castro FA" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Liu X" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Foersti A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Ji J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Sundquist J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Sundquist K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Koshiol J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Hemminki K" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24246767</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.cgh.2013.11.007</DOI><KST>C050</KST><KEYWORD>PERNICIOUS-ANEMIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INFLAMMATORY-BOWEL-DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POPULATION-BASED COHORT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELIAC-DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ULCERATIVE-COLITIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PRIMARY BILIARY-CIRRHOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PRIMARY SCLEROSING CHOLANGITIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRACT CANCER</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>43752</publishedID><Artikel>Micronuclei in Cord Blood Lymphocytes and Associations with Biomarkers of Exposure to Carcinogens and Hormonally Active Factors, Gene Polymorphisms, and Gene Expression: The NewGeneris Cohort</Artikel><Journal>Environmental Health Perspectives</Journal><ABSTr>Background: Leukemia incidence has increased in recent decades among European children, -suggesting that early-life environmental exposures play an important role in disease development.

Objectives: We investigated the hypothesis that childhood susceptibility may increase as a result of in utero exposure to carcinogens and hormonally acting factors. Using cord blood samples from the NewGeneris cohort, we examined associations between a range of biomarkers of carcinogen exposure and hormonally acting factors with micronuclei (MN) frequency as a proxy measure of cancer risk. Associations with gene expression and genotype were also explored.

Methods: DNA and protein adducts, gene expression profiles, circulating hormonally acting factors, and GWAS (genome-wide association study) data were investigated in relation to genomic damage measured by MN frequency in lymphocytes from 623 newborns enrolled between 2006 and 2010 across Europe.

Results: Malondialdehyde DNA adducts (M(1)dG) were associated with increased MN frequency in binucleated lymphocytes (MNBN), and exposure to androgenic, estrogenic, and dioxin-like compounds was associated with MN frequency in mononucleated lymphocytes (MNMONO), although no monotonic exposure-outcome relationship was observed. Lower frequencies of MNBN were associated with a 1-unit increase expression of PDCD11, LATS2, TRIM13, CD28, SMC1A, IL7R, and NIPBL genes. Gene expression was significantly higher in association with the highest versus lowest category of bulky and M(1)dG-DNA adducts for five and six genes, respectively. Gene expression levels were significantly lower for 11 genes in association with the highest versus lowest category of plasma AR CALUX (R) (chemically activated luciferase expression for androgens) (8 genes), ER alpha CALUX (R) (for estrogens) (2 genes), and DR CALUX (R) (for dioxins). Several SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) on chromosome 11 near FOLH1 significantly modified associations between androgen activity and MNBN frequency. Polymorphisms in EPHX1/ 2 and CYP2E1 were associated with MNBN.

Conclusion: We measured in utero exposure to selected environmental carcinogens and circulating hormonally acting factors and detected associations with MN frequency in newborns circulating T lymphocytes. The results highlight mechanisms that may contribute to carcinogen-induced leukemia and require further research.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>122 (2), 193-200</Feld596><PubVol>122</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>193</StrtPage><EndPage>200</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Merlo DF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Agramunt S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Anna L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Besselink H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Botsivali M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Brady NJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Ceppi M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Chatzi L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Chen B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Decordier I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Farmer PB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Fleming S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Fontana V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Försti A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="14" name="Fthenou E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Gallo F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Georgiadis P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Gmuender H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Godschalk RW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Granum B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Hardie LJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Hemminki K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="22" name="Hochstenbach K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Knudsen LE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Kogevinas M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Kovács K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Kyrtopoulos SA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Løvik M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Nielsen JK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Nygaard UC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Pedersen M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Rydberg P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Schoket B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Segerbäck D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Singh R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Sunyer J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Törnqvist M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="van Loveren H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="van Schooten FJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Vande Loock K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="von Stedingk H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Wright J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Kleinjans JC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Kirsch-Volders M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="44" name="van Delft JH" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24252472</PMID><DOI>10.1289/ehp.1206324</DOI><KST>C050</KST><KEYWORD>AUTOMATED IMAGE-ANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MATERNAL DIET</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHILDREN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADDUCTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASSAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DOUBLE-STRAND BREAKS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>43773</publishedID><Artikel>A Large-Scale Assessment of Two-Way SNP Interactions in Breast Cancer Susceptibility Using 46,450 Cases and 42,461 Controls from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium</Artikel><Journal>Human Molecular Genetics</Journal><ABSTr>Part of the substantial unexplained familial aggregation of breast cancer may be due to interactions between common variants, but few studies have had adequate statistical power to detect interactions of realistic magnitude. We aimed to assess all two-way interactions in breast cancer susceptibility between 70 917 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected primarily based on prior evidence of a marginal effect. Thirty-eight international studies contributed data for 46 450 breast cancer cases and 42 461 controls of European origin as part of a multi-consortium project (COGS). First, SNPs were preselected based on evidence (P &lt; 0.01) of a per-allele main effect, and all two-way combinations of those were evaluated by a per-allele (1 d.f.) test for interaction using logistic regression. Second, all 2.5 billion possible two-SNP combinations were evaluated using Boolean operation-based screening and testing, and SNP pairs with the strongest evidence of interaction (P &lt; 10(-4)) were selected for more careful assessment by logistic regression. Under the first approach, 3277 SNPs were preselected, but an evaluation of all possible two-SNP combinations (1 d.f.) identified no interactions at P &lt; 10(-8). Results from the second analytic approach were consistent with those from the first (P &gt; 10(-10)). In summary, we observed little evidence of two-way SNP interactions in breast cancer susceptibility, despite the large number of SNPs with potential marginal effects considered and the very large sample size. This finding may have important implications for risk prediction, simplifying the modelling required. Further comprehensive, large-scale genome-wide interaction studies may identify novel interacting loci if the inherent logistic and computational challenges can be overcome.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (7), 1934-1946</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>1934</StrtPage><EndPage>1946</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Milne RL"

Knowledge on the variation of F2RL3 methylation by various degrees of smoking exposure is still very sparse.

Objectives: We aimed to assess dose-response relationships of current and lifetime active smoking exposure with F2RL3 methylation.

Methods: In a large population-based study, we quantified blood DNA methylation at F2RL3 for 3,588 participants using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Associations of smoking exposure with methylation intensity were examined by multiple linear regression, controlling for potential confounding factors and paying particular attention to dose-response patterns with respect to current and lifetime smoking exposure as well as time since cessation of smoking.

Results: F2RL3 methylation intensity showed a strong association with smoking status (p &lt; 0.0001), which persisted after controlling for potential confounding factors. Clear inverse dose-response relationships with F2RL3 methylation intensity were seen for both current intensity and lifetime pack-years of smoking. Among former smokers, F2RL3 methylation intensity increased gradually from levels close to those of current smokers for recent quitters to levels close to never smokers for long-term (&gt; 20 years) quitters.

Conclusions: F2RL3 methylation is a promising biomarker for both current and long-term past tobacco exposure, and its predictive value for smoking-related diseases warrants further exploration.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>122 (2), 131-137</Feld596><PubVol>122</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>131</StrtPage><EndPage>137</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Zhang Y" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Yang R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Burwinkel B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Breitling LP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24273234</PMID><DOI>10.1289/ehp.1306937</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KST>C080</KST><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LUNG-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CIGARETTE-SMOKING</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CARDIOVASCULAR RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEINASE-ACTIVATED RECEPTOR-4</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIFFERENTIAL DNA METHYLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CESSATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>43845</publishedID><Artikel>Stage-specific associations between beta blocker use and prognosis after colorectal cancer</Artikel><Journal>Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Recent observational studies have suggested that the use of beta blockers might be associated with better prognosis after cancer. Because evidence is limited for colorectal cancer (CRC), the association of beta blocker use and prognosis was investigated in a large population-based cohort of patients with CRC.

METHODS

Between 2003 and 2007, information on beta blocker use at diagnosis and potential confounders was collected by personal interviews for 1975 patients with CRC. Vital status, cause of death, and recurrence status were assessed during a median follow-up time of 5.0 years. The associations of beta blocker use and overall, CRC-specific, and recurrence-free survival were estimated by Cox proportional hazard regression. In addition, beta blocker subgroup, site, and stage-specific analyses were performed.

RESULTS

After adjustment for covariates including sociodemographic, cancer-related, and lifestyle factors and comorbidity and medications, no significant association between beta blocker use at diagnosis and prognosis was observed for all stages combined. However, in stage-specific analyses, beta blocker use was associated with longer overall survival (hazard ratio = 0.50; 95% confidence interval = 0.33-0.78) and CRC-specific survival (hazard ratio = 0.47; 95% confidence interval = 0.30-0.75) in stage IV patients. For these patients, median overall survival was 18 months longer and CRC-specific survival was 17 months longer for beta blocker users than for nonusers (38 versus 20 months and 37 versus 20 months, respectively).

CONCLUSIONS

These results suggest that beta blocker use might be associated with longer survival in patients with stage IV CRC.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>120 (8), 1178-1186</Feld596><PubVol>120</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>1178</StrtPage><EndPage>1186</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Jansen L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Hoffmeister M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Arndt V" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Chang-Claude J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24415516</PMID><DOI>10.1002/cncr.28546</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KST>C070</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>QUALITY-OF-LIFE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NOREPINEPHRINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MELANOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BREAST-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COHORT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>43860</publishedID><Artikel>Cyclin D1 splice site variant triggers chromosomal aberrations in healthy humans</Artikel><Journal>Leukemia</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>28 (3), 721-722</Feld596><PubVol>28</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>721</StrtPage><EndPage>722</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hemminki K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Musak L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Vymetalkova V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Smerhovsky Z" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Halasova E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Osina O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Letkova L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Foersti A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Vodickova L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Buchancova J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Vodicka P" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24270739</PMID><DOI>10.1038/leu.2013.353.</DOI><KST>C050</KST><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>polymorphism</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DAMAGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LYMPHOCYTES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSLOCATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MULTIPLE-MYELOMA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>43926</publishedID><Artikel>In vivo Chloride-35 Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Humans: A Feasibility Study</Artikel><Journal>Radiology</Journal><ABSTr>Purpose: To implement chlorine 35 (Cl-35) magnetic resonance (MR) at a 7-T whole-body MR system and evaluate its feasibility for imaging humans.

Materials and Methods: All examinations were performed with ethical review board approval; written informed consent was obtained from all volunteers. Seven examinations each of brain and muscle in healthy volunteers and four examinations of patients were performed. Two patients with histologically confirmed glioblastoma multiforme underwent brain imaging. Cl-35 MR and Cl-35 inversion-recovery (IR) MR were performed. Two patients with genetically confirmed hypokalemic periodic paralysis underwent calf muscle imaging. Seven multiecho sequences (acquisition time, 5 minutes; voxel dimension, 11 mm(3)) were applied to determine transverse relaxation time as affected by magnetic field heterogeneity (T2*) and chlorine concentration. Cl-35 and sodium 23 (Na-23) MR were conducted with a 7-T whole-body MR system. Cl-35 longitudinal relaxation time (T1) and T2* of healthy human brain and muscle were determined with a three-dimensional density-adapted-projection reconstruction technique to achieve short echo times and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) efficiency. A nonlinear least squares routine and mono- (T1) and biexponential (T2*) models were used for curve fitting.

Results: Phantom imaging revealed 15-fold lower SNR and much shorter relaxation times for Cl-35 than 23Na. In vivo T2* was biexponential and extremely short. Monoexponential fits of T1 revealed 9.2 and 4.0 milliseconds +/- 0.7 (standard deviation) for brain and muscle, respectively. In glioblastoma tissue, increased Cl-concentrations and increased Cl-IR signal intensities were detected. Voxel dimension and acquisition time, respectively, were 6 mm(3) and 9 minutes 45 seconds (Cl-35 MR) and 10 mm(3) and 10 minutes (35Cl IR MR). In patients with hypokalemic periodic paralysis versus healthy volunteers, Cl-and Na+ concentrations were increased. Cl-concentration of muscle could be determined (voxel size, 11 mm(3); total acquisition time, 35 minutes).

Conclusion: MR at 7 T enables in vivo imaging of 35Cl in human brain and muscle in clinically feasible acquisition times (10-35 minutes) and voxel volumes (0.2-1.3 cm(3)). Pathophysiological changes of Cl-homeostasis due to cancer or muscular ion channel disease can be visualized.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>271 (2), 585-595</Feld596><PubVol>271</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>585</StrtPage><EndPage>595</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Nagel, A.M."

Lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan of this bacterium are recognized by CD14, TLR4 and NOD2 human proteins, while NFKB1 activates the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines to elicit an immune response. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these genes have been associated with GC in different populations. We genotyped 30 SNPs of these genes, in 365 gastric adenocarcinomas and 1,284 matched controls from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer cohort. The association with GC and its histological and anatomical subtypes was analyzed by logistic regression and corrected for multiple comparisons. Using a log-additive model, we found a significant association between SNPs in CD14, NOD2 and TLR4 with GC risk. However, after applying the multiple comparisons tests only the NOD2 region remained significant (p = 0.009). Analysis according to anatomical subtypes revealed NOD2 and NFKB1 SNPs associated with noncardia GC and CD14 SNPs associated with cardia GC, while analysis according to histological subtypes showed that CD14 was associated with intestinal but not diffuse GC. The multiple comparisons tests confirmed the association of NOD2 with noncardia GC (p = 0.0003) and CD14 with cardia GC (p = 0.01). Haplotype analysis was in agreement with single SNP results for NOD2 and CD14 genes. From these results, we conclude that genetic variation in NOD2 associates with noncardia GC while variation in CD14 is associated with cardia GC.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>134 (1), 92-101</Feld596><PubVol>134</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>92</StrtPage><EndPage>101</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Companioni O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Bonet C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Munoz X" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Panico S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Palli D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Agnoli C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Vineis P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Boutron-Ruault MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Racine A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Clavel-Chapelon F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Travis RC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Murphy N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Vergnaud AC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Benetou V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Trichopoulos D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Lund E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Johansen D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Lindkvist B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Johansson M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Sund M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Ardanaz E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Sanchez-Cantalejo E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Huerta JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Dorronsoro M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Ramon Quiros J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Mortensen LM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Chang-Claude J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="34" name="Rizzato C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="35" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="de Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Siersema P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Peeters PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Numans ME" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Carneiro F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Licaj I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Freisling H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Sala N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="44" name="Gonzalez CA" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>23824692</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28357</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KST>C055</KST><KEYWORD>carcinoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INFECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPSTEIN-BARR-VIRUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GASTRODUODENAL DISEASES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CD14</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FUNCTIONAL POLYMORPHISM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHINESE POPULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SINGLE-NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROMOTER POLYMORPHISM</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>43943</publishedID><Artikel>Prediagnostic plasma testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, IGF-I and hepatocellular carcinoma: etiological factors or risk markers?</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Elevated prediagnostic testosterone and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) concentrations have been proposed to increase risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the metabolism of these hormones is altered as a consequence of liver damage and they may have clinical utility as HCC risk markers. A case-control study was nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort and included 125 incident HCC cases and 247 individually matched controls. Testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and IGF-I were analyzed by immunoassays. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by conditional logistic regression. The area under the receiver operating curves (AUC) was calculated to assess HCC predictive ability of the tested models. After adjustments for epidemiological variables (body mass index, smoking, ethanol intake, hepatitis and diabetes) and liver damage (a score based on albumin, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransaminase, alanine aminotransaminase, gamma-glutamyltransferase and alkaline phosphatase concentrations), only SHBG remained significantly associated with risk [OR for top versus bottom tertile of 3.86 (1.32-11.3), p(trend) = 0.009]. As a single factor SHBG had an AUC of 0.81 (0.75-0.86). A small, but significant increase in AUC was observed when SHBG was added to a model including the liver damage score and epidemiological variables (from 0.89 to 0.91, p = 0.02) and a net reclassification of 0.47% (0.45-0.48). The observed associations of HCC with prediagnostic SHBG, free testosterone and IGF-I concentrations are in directions opposite to that expected under the etiological hypotheses. SHBG has a potential to be tested as prediagnostic risk marker for HCC.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>134 (1), 164-173</Feld596><PubVol>134</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>164</StrtPage><EndPage>173</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Lukanova A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Becker S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Huesing A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schock H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Fedirko V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Trepo E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Bamia C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Lagiou P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Benetou V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Trichopoulos D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Nothlings U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Dossus L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Teucher B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="16" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Aleksandrova K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Palli D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Pala V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Panico S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Ricceri F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Siersema PD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Peeters PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Quiros JR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Duell EJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Molina-Montes E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Chirlaque MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Gurrea AB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Dorronsoro M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Lindkvist B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Johansen D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Werner M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Sund M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Wareham N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Key TJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Travis RC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Rinaldi S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Romieu I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Gunter MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="44" name="Jenab M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="45" name="Kaaks R" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>23801371</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28342</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>GROWTH-FACTOR-I</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENERGY-BALANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANDROGEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>insulin</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIVER-CIRRHOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SERUM TESTOSTERONE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NESTED CASE-CONTROL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>43944</publishedID><Artikel>Neogenin1 is a Sonic Hedgehog target in medulloblastoma and is necessary for cell cycle progression</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>The canonical Sonic Hedgehog (Shh)/Gli pathway plays multiples roles during central nervous system (CNS) development. To elucidate the molecular repertoire of Shh mediators, we have recently described novel transcriptional targets in response to Shh pathway modulation. Among them, we were able to identify Neogenin1 (Neo1), a death dependence receptor, as a new direct Shh downstream regulator in neural precursor proliferation. As appropriate Shh signaling is required for cerebellar growth and alterations cause Shh-driven medulloblastoma (MB), here we have addressed the role of the Shh/Neogenin1 interaction in the context of cerebellar development and cancer. We demonstrate that the Shh pathway regulates Neogenin1 expression in mouse models that recapitulate the Shh MB subtype. We show that the canonical Shh pathway directly regulates the Neo1 gene acting through an upstream sequence in its promoter both in vitro and in vivo in granule neuron precursor cells. We also identified and characterized a functional Gli-binding site in the first intron of the human NEO1 gene. Gene expression profiling of more than 300 MB shows that NEO1 is indeed upregulated in SHH tumors compared to the other MB subgroups. Finally, we provide evidence that NEO1 is necessary for cell cycle progression in a human MB cell line, because a loss of function of NEO1 arrests cells in the G2/M phase. Taken together, these results highlight Neogenin1 as a novel downstream effector of the Shh pathway in MB and a possible therapeutic target.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>134 (1), 21-31</Feld596><PubVol>134</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>21</StrtPage><EndPage>31</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Milla LA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Arros A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Espinoza N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Remke M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kool M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Taylor MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Pfister SM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Wainwright BJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Palma V" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>23775842</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28330</DOI><KST>B062</KST><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>proliferation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIFFERENTIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOUSE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CEREBELLUM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Neuronal survival</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECEPTOR NEOGENIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENETIC PROFILES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUBGROUPS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>43955</publishedID><Artikel>Enhanced killing of therapy-induced senescent tumor cells by oncolytic measles vaccine viruses</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Therapy-induced senescence (TIS) as a permanent growth arrest can be induced by various stimuli, including anticancer compounds. TIS emerged as a promising strategy to overcome resistance phenomena. However, senescent cancer cells might regain proliferation activity in vivo or even secrete tumor-promoting cytokines. Therefore, successful exploitation of TIS in cancer treatment simultaneously requires the development of effective strategies to eliminate senescent cancer cells. Virotherapy aims to selectively hit tumor cells, thus a combination with senescence-inducing drugs was explored. As a model, we chose measles vaccine virus (MeV), which does not interfere with cellular senescence by itself. In different tumor cell types, such as hepatoma, pancreatic and mammary gland carcinoma, we demonstrate efficient viral replication and lysis after TIS by gemcitabine, doxorubicin or taxol. Applying real time imaging, we even found an accelerated lysis of senescent cancer cells, supporting an enhanced viral replication with an increase in cell-associated and released infectious MeV particles. In summary, we show as a proof-of-concept that senescent tumor cells can be efficiently exploited as virus host cells by oncolytic MeV. These observations open up a new field for preclinical and clinical research to further investigate TIS and oncolytic viruses as an attractive combinatorial future treatment approach.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>134 (1), 235-243</Feld596><PubVol>134</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>235</StrtPage><EndPage>243</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Weiland T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Lampe J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Essmann F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Venturelli S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Berger A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Bossow S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Berchtold S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Schulze-Osthoff K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Lauer UM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Bitzer M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>23797800</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28350</DOI><KST>G100</KST><KEYWORD>CELLULAR SENESCENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HETEROCHROMATIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGRAM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VIRAL THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HALLMARKS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>p53</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER-THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CARCINOMA-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>APOPTOSIS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>43992</publishedID><Artikel>LET-painting increases tumour control probability in hypoxic tumours</Artikel><Journal>Acta Oncologica</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>53 (1), 25-32</Feld596><PubVol>53</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>25</StrtPage><EndPage>32</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Bassler,N."

To present a new method that determines an optimised IGRT couch correction vector from a displacement vector field (DVF). The DVF is computed by a deformable image registration (DIR) method. The proposed method can improve the quality of volume-of-interest (VOI) alignment in image guided radiation therapy (IGRT), and can serve as a decision-making aid for re-planning. Material and methods. The proposed method was demonstrated using the CT data sets of 11 head-and-neck cancer patients with daily kilovoltage control-CTs. A DVF was computed for each control-CT using a DIR method. The DVF was used for voxel tracking and re-contouring of the VOIs in the control-CTs. Then a rigid body transformation, which could be used as couch correction vector, was optimised. The aim of the optimisation process was to find a vector and rotations that map the deformed VOIs into a specified territory. This territory was defined by a margin extension of the VOIs at the time of the planning process. Within this extension, VOI motion and deformation was tolerated. The objective function in the optimisation process was the sum of all volume fractions outside the defined territories. Results. The proposed method was able to find a correction vector, which resulted in a coverage of the target volumes of at least 98% in 52.3% of all fractions. In contrast, a standard IGRT correction using a rigid registration method only fulfilled this criterion in 22.6% of all fractions. The optimisation process took an average of 1.5 minutes per fraction. Conclusion. The knowledge of the deformation of the anatomy allows the determination of an optimised rigid correction vector using our method. The method ensures controlled mapping of the VOIs despite small deformations. If no optimised vector can be determined, re-planning should be considered. Thus, our method can also serve as a decision-making aid for re-planning.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>53 (1), 33-39</Feld596><PubVol>53</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>33</StrtPage><EndPage>39</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Stoiber,E.M."

In addition, to demonstrate a method to evaluate the resulting transformation of such a tool to a reference defined by multiple experts. For 16 patients (seven head and neck, four thoracic, five abdominal), 30-50 anatomical landmarks were defined on recognizable spots of a planning CT and a corresponding fraction CT. A commercially available deformable image registration tool, Velocity AI, was used to align all fraction CTs with the respective planning CTs. The registration accuracy was quantified by means of the target registration error in respect to expert-defined landmarks, considering the interobserver variation of five observers. The interobserver uncertainty of the landmark definition in our data sets is found to be 1.2 +/- 1.1 mm. In general the deformable image registration tool decreases the extent of observable misalignments from 4-8 mm to 1-4 mm for nearly 50% of the landmarks (to 77% in sum). Only small differences are observed in the alignment quality of scans with different tumor location. Smallest residual deviations were achieved in scans of the head and neck region (79%, &lt;= 4 mm) and the thoracic cases (79%, &lt;= 4 mm), followed by the abdominal cases (59%, &lt;= 4 mm). No difference is observed in the alignment quality of different tissue types (bony vs. soft tissue). The investigated commercially available deformable image registration tool is capable of reducing a mean target registration error to a level that is clinically acceptable for the evaluation of retreatment plans and replanning in case of gross tumor change during treatment. Yet, since the alignment quality needs to be improved further, the individual result of the deformable image registration tool has still to be judged by the physician prior to application.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>15 (1), 237-245</Feld596><PubVol>15</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>237</StrtPage><EndPage>245</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hoffmann,C."

NMTC risk in first-degree relatives of affected cases is elevated fivefold to ninefold. Familial NMTC (FNMTC) accounts for about 3-7% of all thyroid tumors and is a more aggressive clinical entity than its sporadic counterparts. Link-age analysis on high-risk families performed a decade ago mapped several susceptibility loci, but did not lead to the identification of high-penetrance causal germline mutations. More recently, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) affecting the risk of sporadic NMTC. We sought to verify if the newly identified genetic risk factors for NMTC are relevant for FNMTC as well. We genotyped 23 SNPs at 11 candidate loci in 672 subjects belonging to 133 pedigrees with at least two NMTC cases. Statistical analysis was performed using family-based association tests, modified quasi-likelihood score and logistic-normal models. SNPs at 9q22.33 near FOXE1 showed convincing evidence of association with NMTC risk in these high-risk families. The other tested loci resulted negative. These findings confirm the importance of the SNPs identified by recent GWAS on sporadic NMTC on FNMTC as well. However, the proposed FOXE1 causal variants do not show the strongest association signal. Moreover, mutation screening of the FOXE1 coding sequence in the FNMTC cases did not identify rarer causal variants, suggesting that other yet unidentified variants at this locus are involved in FNMTC etiology.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>134 (9), 2098-2107</Feld596><PubVol>134</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>2098</StrtPage><EndPage>2107</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Bonora E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Rizzato C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Diquigiovanni C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Oudot-Mellakh T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Campa D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Vargiolu M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Guedj M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="The NMTC Consortium" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="McKay JD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Romeo G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Canzian F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Lesueur F" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24127282</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28543</DOI><KST>C055</KST><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POPULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LINKAGE ANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IDENTIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PAPILLARY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER SUSCEPTIBILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMPLEX HUMAN-DISEASES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MULTINODULAR GOITER</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>44017</publishedID><Artikel>A presentation of the assembly of a frame by generators and relations exhibits its bitopological structure</Artikel><Journal>Algebra Universalis</Journal><ABSTr>We present the assembly of a frame (the frame of its nuclei) by generators and relations.

While the assembly of a locale is by construction zero-dimensional, our presentation contains as additional information the order of specialisation of the original locale.

Its recent discovery in adult humans has opened up new avenues to fight obesity and related disorders such as diabetes. Here, we identified miR-26a and -26b as key regulators of human white and brite adipocyte differentiation. Both microRNAs are upregulated in early adipogenesis, and their inhibition prevented lipid accumulation while their overexpression accelerated it. Intriguingly, miR-26a significantly induced pathways related to energy dissipation, shifted mitochondrial morphology toward that seen in brown adipocytes, and promoted uncoupled respiration by markedly increasing the hallmark protein of brown fat, uncoupling protein 1. By combining in silico target prediction, transcriptomics, and an RNA interference screen, we identified the sheddase ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM17) as a direct target of miR-26 that mediated the observed effects on white and brite adipogenesis. These results point to a novel, critical role for the miR-26 family and its downstream effector ADAM17 in human adipocyte differentiation by promoting characteristics of energy-dissipating thermogenic adipocytes.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>32 (6), 1578-1590</Feld596><PubVol>32</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>1578</StrtPage><EndPage>1590</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Karbiener, M."

However, in today's obesogenic environment, this fine-tuned immunometabolic interface is perturbed. As a consequence, chronic inflammatory conditions and aberrant activation of immune cells have emerged as key features of obesity-related metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance, cardiovascular complications, and type 2 diabetes, whereas a major research focus has been placed on the adipocyte-macrophage interaction in the context of metabolic dysfunction; recent studies have not only expanded the scope of relevant immune cells in this setting but also highlight the impact of distinct metabolic organs, including the liver, on immunometabolic control, metabolic disease development, and potential anti-inflammatory therapeutic options in obesity-driven pathologies. This review will thus summarize recent progress in this emerging area of metabolic research.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>36 (1), 13-25</Feld596><PubVol>36</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>13</StrtPage><EndPage>25</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Eheim, A."

Here we report the definition of a double-negative feedback loop involving AP4 and miR-15a/16-1 that regulates EMT and metastatic progression. In CRC cells, AP4 was downregulated by DNA damage in a p53-dependent manner. AP4 downregulation by p53 was mediated indirectly by the tumor suppressive microRNAs miR-15a and miR-16-1, which targeted the 3'-UTR of AP4 mRNA, induced mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) and promoted CRC cell migration. However, miR-15a/16-1 also acted downstream of p53 to induce MET and limit CRC cell migration. This latter pathway acted as a negative feedback on AP4, the downregulation of which relied upon MET induction by miR-15a/16-1. In tumor xenoplants, ectopic miR-15a/16-1 suppressed formation of lung metastases whereas ectopic AP4 suppressed expression of miR-15a/16-1. In clinical specimens of colorectal cancer, miR-15a levels inversely correlated with AP4 protein levels shown previously to correlate with distant metastasis and poor survival. In summary, our results define a double-negative feedback loop involving miR-15a/16-1 and AP4 that stabilizes epithelial and mesenchymal states, respectively, that may determine metastatic prowess.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>74 (2), 532-542</Feld596><PubVol>74</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>532</StrtPage><EndPage>542</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Shi,L."

We aimed to identify this receptor and analyze whether it is the recently described sodium-taurocholate co-transporter polypeptide (NTCP), encoded by the SLC10A1 gene. METHODS: To identify receptor candidates, we compared gene expression patterns between differentiated HepaRG cells, which express the receptor, and naive cells, which do not. Receptor candidates were evaluated by small hairpin RNA silencing in HepaRG cells; the ability of receptor expression to confer binding and infection were tested in transduced hepatoma cell lines. We used interspecies domain swapping to identify motifs for receptor-mediated host discrimination of HBV and HDV binding and infection. RESULTS: Bioinformatic analyses of comparative expression arrays confirmed that NTCP, which was previously identified through a biochemical approach is a bona fide receptor for HBV and HDV. NTCPs from rat, mouse, and human bound Myrcludex B, a peptide ligand derived from the HBV L-protein. Myrcludex B blocked NTCP transport of bile salts; small hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of NTCP in HepaRG cells prevented their infection by HBV or HDV. Expression of human but not mouse NTCP in HepG2 and HuH7 cells conferred a limited cell-type-related and virus-dependent susceptibility to infection; these limitations were overcome when cells were cultured with dimethyl sulfoxide. We identified 2 short-sequence motifs in human NTCP that were required for species-specific binding and infection by HBV and HDV. CONCLUSIONS: Human NTCP is a specific receptor for HBV and HDV. NTCP-expressing cell lines can be efficiently infected with these viruses, and might be used in basic research and high-throughput screening studies. Mapping of motifs in NTCPs have increased our understanding of the species specificities of HBV and HDV, and could lead to small animal models for studies of viral infection and replication.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>146 (4), 1070-1083</Feld596><PubVol>146</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>1070</StrtPage><EndPage>1083</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ni, Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Lempp, FA."

It involves several genetic and epigenetic alterations, e.g., loss of tumor suppressor gene expression (TP53, PTEN, RB) as well as activation of oncogenes (c-MYC, MET, BRAF, RAS). However, the role of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), which regulate tumor suppressor and oncogene expression at the posttranscriptional level, are not well understood in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here we analyzed RBPs induced in human liver cancer, revealing 116 RBPs with a significant and more than 2-fold higher expression in HCC compared to normal liver tissue. We focused our subsequent analyses on the Insulin-like growth factor 2 messenger RNA (mRNA)-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) representing the most strongly up-regulated RBP in HCC in our cohort. Depletion of IGF2BP1 from multiple liver cancer cell lines inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in vitro. Accordingly, murine xenograft assays after stable depletion of IGF2BP1 reveal that tumor growth, but not tumor initiation, strongly depends on IGF2BP1 in vivo. At the molecular level, IGF2BP1 binds to and stabilizes the c-MYC and MKI67 mRNAs and increases c-Myc and Ki-67 protein expression, two potent regulators of cell proliferation and apoptosis. These substrates likely mediate the impact of IGF2BP1 in human liver cancer, but certainly additional target genes contribute to its function. Conclusion: The RNA-binding protein IGF2BP1 is an important protumorigenic factor in liver carcinogenesis. Hence, therapeutic targeting of IGF2BP1 may offer options for intervention in human HCC.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>59 (5), 1900-1911</Feld596><PubVol>59</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>1900</StrtPage><EndPage>1911</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Gutschner, T*" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Haemmerle, M*" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Pazaitis, N*" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Bley, N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Fiskin, E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Uckelmann, H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Heim, A, Groß, M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Hofmann, N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Geffers, R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Skawran, B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Longerich, T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Breuhahn, K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Schirmacher, P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Muehleck, B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Huettelmaier, S*" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Diederichs, S*" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24395596</PMID><DOI>10.1002/hep.26997</DOI><KST>B150</KST><KEYWORD>CRD-BP</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INCREASED EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LUNG-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VITRO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>C-MYC</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POOR-PROGNOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIVER-CANCER CELLS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>44175</publishedID><Artikel>Global alterations of DNA methylation in cholangiocarcinoma targets the Wnt signaling pathway</Artikel><Journal>Hepatology</Journal><ABSTr>The molecular mechanisms underlying the genesis of cholangiocarcinomas (CCs) are poorly understood. Epigenetic changes such as aberrant hypermethylation and subsequent atypical gene expression are characteristic features of most human cancers. In CC, data regarding global methylation changes are lacking so far. We performed a genome-wide analysis for aberrant promoter methylation in human CCs. We profiled 10 intrahepatic and 8 extrahepatic CCs in comparison to non-neoplastic biliary tissue specimens, using methyl-CpG immunoprecipitation (MCIp) combined with whole-genome CpG island arrays. DNA methylation was confirmed by quantitative mass spectrometric analysis and functional relevance of promoter hypermethylation was shown in demethylation experiments of two CC cell lines using 5-aza-2deoxycytidine (DAC) treatment. Immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays (TMAs) from 223 biliary tract cancers (BTCs) was used to analyze candidate gene expression at the protein level. Differentially methylated, promoter-associated regions were nonrandomly distributed and enriched for genes involved in cancer-related pathways including Wnt, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-), and PI3K signaling pathways. In CC cell lines, silencing of genes involved in Wnt signaling, such as SOX17, WNT3A, DKK2, SFRP1, SFRP2, and SFRP4 was reversed after DAC administration. Candidate protein SFRP2 was substantially down-regulated in neoplastic tissues of all BTC subtypes as compared to normal tissues. A significant inverse correlation of SFRP2 protein expression and pT status was found in BTC patients. Conclusion: We provide a comprehensive analysis to define the genome-wide methylation landscape of human CC. Several candidate genes of cancer-relevant signaling pathways were identified, and closer analysis of selected Wnt pathway genes confirmed the relevance of this pathway in CC. The presented global methylation data are the basis for future studies on epigenetic changes in cholangiocarcinogenesis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>59 (2), 544-554</Feld596><PubVol>59</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>544</StrtPage><EndPage>554</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Goeppert,B."

The aim of this study was to overcome this limitation by using a novel computational approach for the assessment of thoracic aortic displacement and distension in their true four-dimensional extent. Vessel segmentation with landmark tracking was executed on CTA of 24 patients without evidence of aortic disease. Distension magnitudes and maximum displacement vectors (MDV) including their direction were analyzed at 5 aortic locations: left coronary artery (COR), mid-ascending aorta (ASC), brachiocephalic trunk (BCT), left subclavian artery (LSA), descending aorta (DES). Distension was highest for COR (2.3 +/- A 1.2 mm) and BCT (1.7 +/- A 1.1 mm) compared with ASC, LSA, and DES (p &lt; 0.005). MDV decreased from COR to LSA (p &lt; 0.005) and was highest for COR (6.2 +/- A 2.0 mm) and ASC (3.8 +/- A 1.9 mm). Displacement was directed towards left and anterior at COR and ASC. Craniocaudal displacement at COR and ASC was 1.3 +/- A 0.8 and 0.3 +/- A 0.3 mm. At BCT, LSA, and DES no predominant displacement direction was observable. Vessel displacement and wall distension are highest in the ascending aorta, and ascending aortic displacement is primarily directed towards left and anterior. Craniocaudal displacement remains low even close to the left cardiac ventricle.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>30 (1), 185-194</Feld596><PubVol>30</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>185</StrtPage><EndPage>194</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Weber,T.F."

Over the past decade, progress in improving survival using conventional therapies has stalled, resulting in reduced quality of life due to treatment-related side effects, which are a major concern in survivors. The vast amount of genomic and molecular data generated over the last 5-10 years encourages optimism that improved risk stratification and new molecular targets will improve outcomes. It is now clear that medulloblastoma is not a single-disease entity, but instead consists of at least four distinct molecular subgroups: WNT/Wingless, Sonic Hedgehog, Group 3, and Group 4. The Medulloblastoma Down Under 2013 meeting, which convened at Bunker Bay, Australia, brought together 50 leading clinicians and scientists. The 2-day agenda included focused sessions on pathology and molecular stratification, genomics and mouse models, high-throughput drug screening, and clinical trial design. The meeting established a global action plan to translate novel biologic insights and drug targeting into treatment regimens to improve outcomes. A consensus was reached in several key areas, with the most important being that a novel classification scheme for medulloblastoma based on the four molecular subgroups, as well as histopathologic features, should be presented for consideration in the upcoming fifth edition of the World Health Organization's classification of tumours of the central nervous system. Three other notable areas of agreement were as follows: (1) to establish a central repository of annotated mouse models that are readily accessible and freely available to the international research community; (2) to institute common eligibility criteria between the Children's Oncology Group and the International Society of Paediatric Oncology Europe and initiate joint or parallel clinical trials; (3) to share preliminary high-throughput screening data across discovery labs to hasten the development of novel therapeutics. Medulloblastoma Down Under 2013 was an effective forum for meaningful discussion, which resulted in enhancing international collaborative clinical and translational research of this rare disease. This template could be applied to other fields to devise global action plans addressing all aspects of a disease, from improved disease classification, treatment stratification, and drug targeting to superior treatment regimens to be assessed in cooperative international clinical trials.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>127 (2), 189-201</Feld596><PubVol>127</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>189</StrtPage><EndPage>201</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Gottardo NG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Hansford JR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="McGlade JP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Alvaro F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Ashley DM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Bailey S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Baker DL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Bourdeaut F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Cho YJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Clay M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Clifford SC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Cohn RJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Cole CH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Dallas PB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Downie P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Doz F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Ellison DW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Endersby R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Fisher PG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Hassall T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Heath JA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Hii HL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Jones DT" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="23" name="Junckerstorff R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Kellie S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Kool M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="26" name="Kotecha RS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Lichter P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="28" name="Laughton SJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Lee S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="McCowage G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Northcott PA" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="32" name="Olson JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Packer RJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Pfister SM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="35" name="Pietsch T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Pizer B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Pomeroy SL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Remke M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Robinson GW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Rutkowski S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Schoep T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Shelat AA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Stewart CF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="44" name="Sullivan M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="45" name="Taylor MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="46" name="Wainwright B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="47" name="Walwyn T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="48" name="Weiss WA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="49" name="Williamson D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="50" name="Gajjar A" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24264598</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00401-013-1213-7</DOI><KST>B060</KST><KST>B062</KST><KEYWORD>CHILDRENS CANCER GROUP</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CRANIOSPINAL RADIATION-THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STEM-CELL RESCUE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK MEDULLOBLASTOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BETA-CATENIN STATUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>outcome prediction</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHILDHOOD MEDULLOBLASTOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PEDIATRIC-ONCOLOGY-GROUP</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HIGH-DOSE CHEMOTHERAPY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>44199</publishedID><Artikel>Image quality influences the assessment of left ventricular function: An intraoperative comparison of five twodimensional echocardiographic methods with real-time three-dimensional echocardiography as a reference</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>33 (2), 297-306</Feld596><PubVol>33</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>297</StrtPage><EndPage>306</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Grossgasteiger M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Hien MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Graser B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Rauch H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Motsch J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Gondan M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Rosendal C."

So far, its oncogenic role has been controversially discussed because both overexpression and inactivating mutations are found. A recent study on primary samples from patients with acute T-cell leukemia (T-ALL) revealed that most of them do not express WT1 proteins although they express WT1 mRNA. In our study, we investigated WT-1 expression in ten T-ALL cell lines established from leukemia/lymphoma patients. We show that consistent with the finding in primary T-ALL cells, most of the leukemic T-cell lines tested do not overexpress WT1 proteins. We found that leukemic T-cells overexpressing WT1 protein produce higher levels of CD95L and show elevated CD95L-mediated activation-induced cell death (AICD) compared to cells lacking or expressing low levels of WT1. Ectopic expression of WT1 in the WT1-nonexpressing leukemic T-cell line increases CD95L expression and elevates activation-induced apoptosis, whereas silencing WT1 expression in the WT1-overexpressing leukemic T-cell line by siRNA confers reduced CD95L expression and reduction in AICD. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase-promoter reporter analysis demonstrate that WT1 binds to and enhances CD95L promoter activity through the Egr-binding sites. Our study provides a new role of WT1 in regulation of CD95L-mediated cell death.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>134 (2), 291-300</Feld596><PubVol>134</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>291</StrtPage><EndPage>300</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Bourkoula K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Englert C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Giaisi M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Koehler R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Krammer PH" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Li-Weber M."

Suspicious lesions on mpMRI at 3.0 T were scored according to the PI-RADS system before MR/TRUS fusion-guided biopsy and correlated to histopathology results. Statistical correlation was obtained by a Mann-Whitney U test. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and optimal thresholds were calculated.

In 64 patients, 128/445 positive biopsy cores were obtained out of 95 suspicious regions of interest (ROIs). PCa was present in 27/64 (42 %) of the patients. ROC results for the aggregated PI-RADS scores exhibited higher areas under the curve compared to those of the Likert score. Sensitivity/specificity for the following thresholds were calculated: 73 %/92 % and 85 %/67 % for PI-RADS scores of 9 and 10, respectively; 85 %/56 % and 60 %/97 % for Likert scores of 3 and 4, respectively.

The standardised ESUR PI-RADS system is beneficial to indicate the likelihood of PCa of suspicious lesions on mpMRI. It is also valuable to identify locations to be targeted with biopsy. The aggregated PI-RADS score achieved better results compared to the single five-point Likert score.

Detecting endogenous SUMOylation is challenging: most small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) targets are low in abundance, and only a fraction of a protein's cellular pool is typically SUMOylated. Here we present a step-by-step protocol for the enrichment of endogenous SUMO targets from mammalian cells and tissues (specifically, mouse liver), based on the use of monoclonal antibodies that are available to the scientific community. The protocol comprises (i) production of antibodies and affinity matrix, (ii) denaturing cell lysis, and (iii) SUMO immunoprecipitation followed by peptide elution. Production of affinity matrix and cell lysis requires similar to 1 d. The immunoprecipitation with peptide elution can be performed in 2 d. As SUMO proteins are conserved, this protocol should also be applicable to other organisms, including many vertebrates and Drosophila melanogaster.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (4), 896-909</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>896</StrtPage><EndPage>909</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Barysch, S.V."

Genome-wide association studies have identified FGFR2 as a breast cancer susceptibility gene. Common variation in other fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptors might also modify risk. We tested this hypothesis by studying genotyped single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and imputed SNPs in FGFR1, FGFR3, FGFR4 and FGFRL1 in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium.

Methods: Data were combined from 49 studies, including 53 835 cases and 50 156 controls, of which 89 050 (46 450 cases and 42 600 controls) were of European ancestry, 12 893 (6269 cases and 6624 controls) of Asian and 2048 (1116 cases and 932 controls) of African ancestry. Associations with risk of breast cancer, overall and by disease sub-type, were assessed using unconditional logistic regression.

Results: Little evidence of association with breast cancer risk was observed for SNPs in the FGF receptor genes. The strongest evidence in European women was for rs743682 in FGFR3; the estimated per-allele odds ratio was 1.05 (95% confidence interval 1.02-1.09, P=0.0020), which is substantially lower than that observed for SNPs in FGFR2.

Conclusion: Our results suggest that common variants in the other FGF receptors are not associated with risk of breast cancer to the degree observed for FGFR2.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>110 (4), 1088-1100</Feld596><PubVol>110</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>1088</StrtPage><EndPage>1100</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Agarwal,D."

Women carrying many of the risk variants may have 4-fold increased risk relative to women with few variants.Triple-negative (TN) breast cancer is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer associated with a unique set of epidemiologic and genetic risk factors. We conducted a two-stage genome-wide association study of TN breast cancer (stage 1: 1529 TN cases, 3399 controls; stage 2: 2148 cases, 1309 controls) to identify loci that influence TN breast cancer risk. Variants in the 19p13.1 and PTHLH loci showed genome-wide significant associations (P &lt; 5 x 10(-) (8)) in stage 1 and 2 combined. Results also suggested a substantial enrichment of significantly associated variants among the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) analyzed in stage 2. Variants from 25 of 74 known breast cancer susceptibility loci were also associated with risk of TN breast cancer (P &lt; 0.05). Associations with TN breast cancer were confirmed for 10 loci (LGR6, MDM4, CASP8, 2q35, 2p24.1, TERT-rs10069690, ESR1, TOX3, 19p13.1, RALY), and we identified associations with TN breast cancer for 15 additional breast cancer loci (P &lt; 0.05: PEX14, 2q24.1, 2q31.1, ADAM29, EBF1, TCF7L2, 11q13.1, 11q24.3, 12p13.1, PTHLH, NTN4, 12q24, BRCA2, RAD51L1-rs2588809, MKL1). Further, two SNPs independent of previously reported signals in ESR1 [rs12525163 odds ratio (OR) = 1.15, P = 4.9 x 10(-) (4)] and 19p13.1 (rs1864112 OR = 0.84, P = 1.8 x 10(-) (9)) were associated with TN breast cancer. A polygenic risk score (PRS) for TN breast cancer based on known breast cancer risk variants showed a 4-fold difference in risk between the highest and lowest PRS quintiles (OR = 4.03, 95% confidence interval 3.46-4.70, P = 4.8 x 10(-) (69)). This translates to an absolute risk for TN breast cancer ranging from 0.8% to 3.4%, suggesting that genetic variation may be used for TN breast cancer risk prediction.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>35 (5), 1012-1019</Feld596><PubVol>35</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>1012</StrtPage><EndPage>1019</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Purrington,K.S."

A vital demand for this epidermal permeability barrier is the lipid-enriched lamellar matrix that embeds the enucleated corneocytes. Ceramides are the major components of these highly ordered intercellular lamellar structures, in which linoleic acid- and protein-esterified ceramides are crucial for structuring and maintaining skin barrier integrity. In this review, we describe the fascinating diversity of epidermal ceramides including 1-O-acylceramides. We focus on epidermal ceramide biosynthesis emphasizing its metabolic and topological requirements and discuss enzymes that may be involved in alpha- and omega-hydroxylation. Finally, we turn to epidermal ceramide regulation, highlighting transcription factors and liposensors recently described to play crucial roles in modulating skin lipid metabolism and epidermal barrier homeostasis.

In contrast to childhood ALL, survival for adults with ALL is poor. Recently, new protocols, including use of pediatric protocols in young adults, have improved survival in clinical trials. Here, we examine population level survival in Germany and the United States (US) to gain insight into the extent to which changes in clinical trials have translated into better survival on the population level.

Methods: Data were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database in the US and 11 cancer registries in Germany. Patients age 15-69 diagnosed with ALL were included. Period analysis was used to estimate 5-year relative survival (RS).

Results: Overall 5-year RS was estimated at 43.4% for Germany and 35.5% for the US (p = 0.004), with a decrease in survival with increasing age. Survival was higher in Germany than the US for men (43.6% versus 37.7%, p = 0.002) but not for women (42.4% versus 40.3%, p &gt; 0.1). Five-year RS estimates increased in Germany and the US between 2002 and 2006 by 11.8 and 7.3 percent units, respectively (p = 0.02 and 0.04, respectively).

Conclusions: Survival for adults with ALL continues to be low compared with that for children, but a substantial increase in 5-year survival estimates was seen from 2002 to 2006 in both Germany and the US. The reasons for the survival differences between both countries require clarification.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (1), e85554-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>e85554</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Pulte DP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Jansen L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Gondos A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Katalinic A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Barnes B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Ressing M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Holleczek B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Eberle A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="and the GEKID Cancer Survival Working Group" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24475044</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0085554</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>EARLY 21ST-CENTURY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER-PATIENT SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>UP-TO-DATE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EMPIRICAL-EVALUATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PERIOD ANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIAGNOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRIAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRENDS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHILDREN</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>44493</publishedID><Artikel>Selection of appropriate tumour data sets for Benchmark dose modelling (BMD) and derivation of a margin of exposure (MoE) for substances that are genotoxic and carcinogenic: consderations of biological relevance of tumour type, data quality and uncertainty assessment</Artikel><Journal>Food and Chemical Toxicology</Journal><ABSTr>This article addresses a number of concepts related to the selection and modelling of carcinogenicity data for the calculation of a Margin of Exposure. It follows up on the recommendations put forward by the International Life Sciences Institute - European branch in 2010 on the application of the Margin of Exposure (MoE) approach to substances in food that are genotoxic and carcinogenic. The aims are to provide practical guidance on the relevance of animal tumour data for human carcinogenic hazard assessment, appropriate selection of tumour data for Benchmark Dose Modelling, and approaches for dealing with the uncertainty associated with the selection of data for modelling and, consequently, the derived Point of Departure (PoD) used to calculate the MoE. Although the concepts outlined in this article are interrelated, the background expertise needed to address each topic varies. For instance, the expertise needed to make a judgement on biological relevance of a specific tumour type is clearly different to that needed to determine the statistical uncertainty around the data used for modelling a benchmark dose. As such, each topic is dealt with separately to allow those with specialised knowledge to target key areas of guidance and provide a more in-depth discussion on each subject for those new to the concept of the Margin of Exposure approach.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>70 (), 264-289</Feld596><PubVol>70</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>264</StrtPage><EndPage>289</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Edler,L."

Mutations in the gene are associated with idiopathic short stature and are responsible for the growth failure and skeletal defects found in the majority of patients with Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis (LWD) and Langer mesomelic dysplasia. SHOX is expressed in growth plate chondrocytes where it is supposed to modulate the proliferation, differentiation and cell death of these cells. Supporting this hypothesis, in vitro studies have shown that SHOX expression induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in both transformed and primary cells. In this study, we further characterized the cell death mechanisms triggered by SHOX and compared them with the effects induced by one clinically relevant mutant form of SHOX, detected in LWD patients (SHOX R153L) and a SHOX C-terminally truncated version (L185X). We show that SHOX expression in U2OS osteosarcoma cells leads to oxidative stress that, in turn, induces lysosomal membrane rupture with release of active cathepsin B to the cytosol and subsequent activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway characterized by mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and caspase activation. Importantly, cells expressing SHOX R153L or L185X did not display any of these features. Given the fact that many of the events observed in SHOX-expressing cells also characterize the complex cell death process occurring in the growth plate during endochondral ossification, our findings further support the hypothesis that SHOX may play a central role in the regulation of the cell death pathways activated during long bone development.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (6), 1619-1630</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>1619</StrtPage><EndPage>1630</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hristov, G."

One of the major challenges in treatment of CLL is the achievement of a complete remission to prevent relapse of disease originating from cells within lymphoid tissues and subsequent chemoresistance. In search for novel drugs that target CLL cells also in protective microenvironments, we performed a fungal extract screen using cocultures of primary CLL cells with bone marrow-derived stromal cells. A metabolite produced by Penicillium aquamarinium was identified as Chaetoglobosin A, a member of the cytochalasan family that showed preferential induction of apoptosis in CLL cells, even under culture conditions that mimic lymphoid tissues. In vitro testing of 89 CLL cases revealed effective targeting of CLL cells by Chaetoglobosin A, independent of bad prognosis characteristics, like 17p deletion or TP53 mutation. To provide insight into its mechanism of action, we showed that ChA targets filamentous actin in CLL cells and thereby induces cell cycle arrest and inhibits membrane ruffling and cell migration. Our data further revealed that Chaetoglobosin A prevents CLL cell activation and sensitizes them for treatment with PI3K and BTK inhibitors, suggesting this compound as a novel potential drug for CLL.Leukemia accepted article preview online, 27 November 2013. doi:10.1038/leu.2013.360.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>28 (6), 1289-1298</Feld596><PubVol>28</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>1289</StrtPage><EndPage>1298</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Knudsen PB*" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Hanna B*" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Ohl S*" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Sellner L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Zenz T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Doehner H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Stilgenbauer S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Larsen TO" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Lichter P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Seiffert M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="(*shared first authorship)" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24280868</PMID><DOI>10.1038/leu.2013.360</DOI><KST>B060</KST><KST>G100</KST><KEYWORD>B-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MIGRATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BONE-MARROW</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VITRO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CLONAL EVOLUTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOMIC ABERRATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MARROW STROMAL CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CYTOCHALASIN E</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>44570</publishedID><Artikel>Comparison of PET imaging with a (68)Ga-labelled PSMA ligand and (18)F-choline-based PET/CT for the diagnosis of recurrent prostate cancer</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: Positron emission tomography (PET) with choline tracers has found widespread use for the diagnosis of prostate cancer (PC). However, choline metabolism is not increased in a considerable number of cases, whereas prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is overexpressed in most PCs. Therefore, a (68)Ga-labelled PSMA ligand could be superior to choline tracers by obtaining a high contrast. The aim of this study was to compare such a novel tracer with standard choline-based PET/CT. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with biochemical relapse of PC [mean prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 11.1 +/- 24.1 ng/ml, range 0.01-116] were retrospectively analysed after (18)F-fluoromethylcholine and (68)Ga-PSMA PET/CT within a time window of 30 days. Radiotracer uptake that was visually considered as PC was semi-quantitatively analysed by measuring the maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of the scans acquired 1 h after injection of (68)Ga-PSMA complex solution (median 132 MBq, range 59-263 MBq) and (18)F-fluoromethylcholine (median 237 MBq, range 114-374 MBq), respectively. In addition, tumour to background ratios were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 78 lesions characteristic for PC were detected in 32 patients using (68)Ga-PSMA PET/CT and 56 lesions were detected in 26 patients using choline PET/CT. The higher detection rate in (68)Ga-PSMA PET/CT was statistically significant (p = 0.04). In five patients no lesion was found with both methods. All lesions detected by (18)F-fluoromethylcholine PET/CT were also seen by (68)Ga-PSMA PET/CT. In (68)Ga-PSMA PET/CT SUVmax was clearly (&gt;10 %) higher in 62 of 78 lesions (79.1 %) and the tumour to background ratio was clearly (&gt;10 %) higher in 74 of 78 lesions (94.9 %) when compared to (18)F-fluoromethylcholine PET/CT. CONCLUSION: (68)Ga-PSMA PET/CT can detect lesions characteristic for PC with improved contrast when compared to standard (18)F-fluoromethylcholine PET/CT, especially at low PSA levels.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>41 (1), 11-20</Feld596><PubVol>41</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>11</StrtPage><EndPage>20</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Afshar-Oromieh,A."

Methods: 49 participants (31 men, 18 women, 51-71 years) of the German Lung Cancer Screening and Intervention Trial (LUSI) with a cancer-suspicious lung lesion in CT were examined with non-contrast-enhanced MRI of the lung at 1.5 T. Data were pseudonymized and presented at random order together with 30 datasets (23 in men, 7 in women, 18-64 years) from healthy volunteers. Two radiologists read the data for the presence of nodules. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Gold standard was either histology or long-term follow-up. Contrast-to-Noise-Ratio (CNR) was measured for all detected lesions in all MRI sequences.

Results: Average maximum diameter of the lesions was 15 mm. Overall sensitivity and specificity of MRI were 48% (26/54) and 88% (29/33) compared to low-dose CT. Sensitivity of MRI was significantly higher for malignant nodules (78% (12.5/16)) than for benign ones (36% (13.5/38); P = 0.007). There was no statistically significant difference in sensitivity between nodules (benign and malignant) larger or smaller than 10 mm (P = 0.7). Inter observer agreement was 84% (kappa = 0.65). Lesion-to-background CNR of T2-weighted single-shot turbo-spin-echo was significantly higher for malignant nodules (89 +/- 27) than for benign ones (56 +/- 23; P = 0.002).

Conclusion: The sensitivity of MRI for detection of malignant pulmonary nodules in a high-risk population is 78%. Due to its inherent soft tissue contrast, MRI is more sensitive to malignant nodules than to benign ones. MRI may therefore represent a useful test for early detection of lung cancer.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>83 (3), 600-605</Feld596><PubVol>83</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>600</StrtPage><EndPage>605</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Sommer,G."

Using a case-control study nested within the prospective European EPIC cohort (938 breast cancer cases and 1,394 matched control subjects), we analyzed the relationships of prediagnostic serum IGF-I levels with the risk of estrogen and progesterone receptor-positive and -negative breast tumors. IGF-I levels were positively associated with the risk of ER+ breast tumors overall (pre- and postmenopausal women combined, odds ratio (OR)(Q4-Q1)=1.41 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.98] for the highest vs. lowest quartile; OR=1.17 [95% CI 1.04-1.33] per 1-standard deviation (SD) increase in IGF-I, p(trend)=0.01) and among women who were diagnosed with breast cancer at 50 years or older (ORQ3-Q1=1.38 [95% CI 1.01-1.89]; OR=1.19 [95% CI 1.04-1.36] per 1-SD increase in IGF-I, p(trend)=0.01) but not with receptor-positive disease diagnosed at an earlier age. No statistically significant associations were observed for ER- breast tumors overall and by age at diagnosis. Tests for heterogeneity by receptor status of the tumor were not statistically significant, except for women diagnosed with breast cancer at 50 years or older (p(het)=0.03 for ER+/PR+ vs. ER-/PR- disease). Our data add to a global body of evidence indicating that higher circulating IGF-I levels may increase risk specifically of receptor-positive, but not receptor-negative, breast cancer diagnosed at 50 years or older.

What's new? Both estrogen and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) promote breast cancer formation, and evidence suggests the two may work together. Some breast tumors express estrogen receptor, others don't. Does the presence of estrogen receptor allow IGF-I to stimulate tumor formation? To address this question, the authors compared women's IGF-I levels before diagnosis with their risk of developing breast cancer, with or without estrogen receptor. They found a direct relationship between IGF levels and risk of ER-positive breast tumors diagnosed after age 50. They found no association with ER-positive tumors diagnosed at an earlier age, nor with ER-negative tumors.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>134 (11), 2683-2690</Feld596><PubVol>134</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>2683</StrtPage><EndPage>2690</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kaaks,R."

Using a case-control study nested within the prospective European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort (801 breast cancer cases and 1,132 matched control subjects), we analyzed the relationships of prediagnostic serum estradiol, free estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, free testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels with the risk of breast cancer by estrogen and progesterone receptor-positive and -negative breast tumors and by age at diagnoses. Higher prediagnostic serum levels of testosterone and free testosterone were associated with an increased overall risk of breast cancer [ORQ4-Q1=1.56 (95% CI 1.15-2.13), p(trend)=0.02 for testosterone and ORQ4-Q1=1.33 (95% CI 0.99-1.79), p(trend)=0.04 for free testosterone], but no significant risk association was observed for estradiol, free estradiol, progesterone and SHBG. Tests for heterogeneity between receptor-positive and -negative tumors were not significant. When analysis were stratified by age at tumor diagnosis, the odds ratios observed for estradiol were stronger and borderline significant for breast cancer diagnosed at age less than 50 [ORQ4-Q1=1.32 (95% CI 0.87-2.01), p(trend)=0.05] compared to breast cancer diagnosed at age 50 or above [ORQ4-Q1=0.94 (95% CI 0.60-1.47), p(trend)=0.34, p(het)=0.04]. In conclusion, our data indicate that higher premenopausal circulating testosterone levels are associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer, but do not show a significant association of estradiol or progesterone with breast cancer risk, overall, by menstrual cycle phase or by tumor receptor status, although a possible risk increase with higher estradiol levels for tumors diagnosed before age 50 was seen.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>134 (8), 1947-1957</Feld596><PubVol>134</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>1947</StrtPage><EndPage>1957</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kaaks,R."

PA may reduce cancer risk by changing endogenous hormones levels, but relatively little research has focused on this topic. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the relation between PA and endogenous hormone concentrations.

A cross-sectional analysis of 798 pre- and 1,360 post-menopausal women included as controls in case-control studies on endogenous hormones (steroids, progesterone, sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and growth factors) levels, and cancer risk nested within European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort was performed. Multivariate regression analyses were performed to compare geometric mean levels of hormones and SHBG by categories of PA.

In pre-menopausal women, active women had 19 % significantly lower concentrations of androstenedione, 14 % lower testosterone, and 20 % lower free testosterone than inactive women, while no differences were observed for estrogens, progesterone, SHBG, and growth factors. In post-menopausal women, active women had 18 % significantly lower estradiol and 20 % lower free estradiol concentrations than inactive women, while no differences were observed for the other hormones and SHBG. More vigorous forms of physical activity were associated with higher insulin-like growth factor-I concentrations. Adjustment for body mass index did not alter the associations. Overall, the percentage of variance in hormone concentrations explained by PA levels was &lt; 2 %.

Our results support the hypothesis of an influence, although small in magnitude, of PA on sex hormone levels in blood, independent of body size.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>25 (1), 111-124</Feld596><PubVol>25</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>111</StrtPage><EndPage>124</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Rinaldi,S."

This association was now re-examined in an extended dataset to investigate potential effect modification by tumor characteristics and lifestyle factors. A prospective cohort study was conducted in Germany including 2,177 incident stage I-IV postmenopausal breast cancer patients aged 50-74 years. Patients were diagnosed between 2001 and 2005 and median follow-up time was 5.3 years. Cox proportional hazards models were stratified by age at diagnosis, study center and season of blood collection and adjusted for other prognostic factors. A meta-analysis of studies on circulating 25(OH)D and mortality in breast cancer patients was performed to summarize evidence. Lower concentrations of 25(OH)D were significantly associated with higher risk of overall mortality [hazard ratio (HR) lowest vs. highest tertile = 1.86; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.22, 2.82; p-trend = 0.002] and distant disease (HR = 1.76; 95% CI: 1.24, 2.49; p-trend = 0.003) in stage I-IIIa but not in stage IIIb-IV breast cancer patients. No significant interaction by lifestyle factors was observed (all p-interaction &gt; 0.05). The meta-analysis yielded significant associations with overall and breast cancer-specific mortality (lowest vs. highest quantile: HR = 1.52; 95% CI: 1.22, 1.88 and HR = 1.74; 95% CI: 1.23, 2.40, respectively). In conclusion, post-diagnostic circulating 25(OH)D concentrations were associated with overall mortality and distant disease in stage I-IIIa postmenopausal breast cancer patients. This association was not strongly modified by lifestyle factors.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>134 (12), 2972-2983</Feld596><PubVol>134</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>2972</StrtPage><EndPage>2983</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Vrieling,A."

This leads to unwanted T-2 and MT signal contributions that lessen the CEST signal specificity to the underlying biochemical exchange processes. A spillover correction is of special interest for clinical static field strengths and protons resonating near the water peak. This is the case for all endogenous CEST agents, such as amide proton transfer, -OH-CEST of glycosaminoglycans, glucose or myo-inositol, and amine exchange of creatine or glutamate. All CEST effects also appear to be scaled by the T-1 relaxation time of water, as they are mediated by the water pool. This forms the motivation for simple metrics that correct the CEST signal. Based on eigenspace theory, we propose a novel magnetization transfer ratio (MTRRex), employing the inverse Z-spectrum, which eliminates spillover and semi-solid MT effects. This metric can be simply related to R-ex, the exchange-dependent relaxation rate in the rotating frame, and k(a), the inherent exchange rate. Furthermore, it can be scaled by the duty cycle, allowing for simple translation to clinical protocols. For verification, the amine proton exchange of creatine in solutions with different agar concentrations was studied experimentally at a clinical field strength of 3T, where spillover effects are large. We demonstrate that spillover can be properly corrected and that quantitative evaluation of pH and creatine concentration is possible. This proves that MTRRex is a quantitative and biophysically specific CEST-MRI metric. Applied to acute stroke induced in rat brain, the corrected CEST signal shows significantly higher contrast between the stroke area and normal tissue, as well as less B-1 dependence, than conventional approaches.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>27 (3), 240-252</Feld596><PubVol>27</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>240</StrtPage><EndPage>252</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Zaiss, M."

Recently, a second SDF-1 receptor, CXCR7, was found to enhance tumor growth in solid tumors. Albeit signaling cascades via SDF-1/CXCR4 have been intensively studied, the significance of the SDF-1/CXCR7-induced intracellular communication triggering malignancy is still only marginally understood.

Experimental Design: In tumor tissue of 52 patients with colorectal cancer, we observed that expression of CXCR7 and CXCR4 increased with tumor stage and tumor size. Asking whether activation of CXCR4 or CXCR7 might result in a similar expression pattern, we performed microarray expression analyses using lentivirally CXCR4- and/or CXCR7-overexpressing SW480 colon cancer cell lines with and without stimulation by SDF-1 alpha.

Results: Gene regulation via SDF-1 alpha/CXCR4 and SDF-1 alpha/CXCR7 was completely different and partly antidromic. Differentially regulated genes were assigned by gene ontology to migration, proliferation, and lipid metabolic processes. Expressions of AKR1C3, AXL, C5, IGFBP7, IL24, RRAS, and TNNC1 were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Using the in silico gene set enrichment analysis, we showed that expressions of miR-217 and miR-218 were increased in CXCR4 and reduced in CXCR7 cells after stimulation with SDF-1 alpha. Functionally, exposure to SDF-1 alpha increased invasiveness of CXCR4 and CXCR7 cells, AXL knockdown hampered invasion. Compared with controls, CXCR4 cells showed increased sensitivity against 5-FU, whereas CXCR7 cells were more chemoresistant.

Conclusions: These opposing results for CXCR4- or CXCR7-overexpressing colon carcinoma cells demand an unexpected attention in the clinical application of chemokine receptor antagonists such as plerixafor.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>20 (3), 604-616</Feld596><PubVol>20</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>604</StrtPage><EndPage>616</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Heckmann D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Maier P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Laufs S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Li L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Sleeman J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Trunk MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Leupold JH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Wenz F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Zeller WJ" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Fruehauf S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Allgayer H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24255072</PMID><DOI>10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-0582</DOI><KST>G360</KST><KST>G402</KST><KST>G100</KST><KST>B063</KST><KEYWORD>COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL-MIGRATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>T-LYMPHOCYTES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Axl</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHEMOKINE RECEPTOR CXCR4</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METASTATIC BEHAVIOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SDF-1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR-GROWTH</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>44701</publishedID><Artikel>A mechanistic study on the metastasis inducing function of FUS-CHOP fusion protein in liposarcoma</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>The FUS-CHOP fusion protein has been found to be instrumental for specific oncogenic processes in liposarcoma, but its ability to induce metastasis and the underlying mechanisms by which this can be achieved remain unknown. In order to dissect its functional role in this context, we stably overexpressed this protein in SW872 liposarcoma and HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell lines, and were able to demonstrate that forced expression of FUS-CHOP significantly increases migration and invasion, as well as enhances lung and liver metastasis in the in vivo chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model, that is proliferation independent. Additionally, FUS-CHOP enhances the expression of matrix-metalloproteinases -2 and -9, and transactivates their promoters in vitro. Mutational analysis showed that CEBP-beta- (-769 to-755), NF-kappaB (-525 to-516) and CREB AP-1 (-218 to -207) sites were important for MMP-2 and NF-kappa B (-604 to -598), AP-1 (-539 to -532) and AP-1 (-81 to -72) for MMP-9 transactivation. Moreover, a direct in vivo interaction of FUS-CHOP was observed in case of the MMP-2 promoter within region (-769 to -207). siRNA data revealed that MMP-2 expression is essential in the FUS-CHOP induced metastatic phenotype. MMP-2-mRNA and protein expression correlated significantly with FUS-CHOP positivity in 46 resected patient liposarcoma tissues. We have for the first time provided substantial evidence for the FUS-CHOP oncoprotein as an inducer of metastasis that is due to the transcriptional induction of specific tumor-associated proteases.

However, little is known on smoking and its association with survival after CRC diagnosis. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize current evidence. A systematic literature search was carried out in MEDLINE and ISI Web of Science. We included studies that analyzed recurrence-free survival, disease-free survival, all-cause, and CRC-specific mortality according to smoking status. Data were extracted in duplicate. Standard methods of meta-analysis were applied. Sixteen studies from 11 countries were identified, comprising a total sample size of 62 278 CRC patients. Overall, in the 16 included studies, current smoking and, to a lesser extent, former smoking were rather consistently associated with a poorer prognosis compared with never smokers. Meta-analyses yielded random-effects hazard ratio estimates (95% confidence intervals) for all-cause mortality of 1.26 (1.15-1.37) and 1.11 (0.93-1.33) for current and former smokers, compared with never smokers, respectively. In particular, 30-day mortality was found to be increased by between 49% and 100% among current compared with never smokers. Our results support the existence of detrimental effects of smoking on survival also after CRC diagnosis. Perspectives for enhancing prognosis of CRC patients by smoking abstinence deserve increased attention in further research and clinical practice.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>25 (8), 1517-1525</Feld596><PubVol>25</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>1517</StrtPage><EndPage>1525</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Walter V" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Jansen L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Hoffmeister M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24692581</PMID><DOI>10.1093/annonc/mdu040</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>COMPLICATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CIGARETTE-SMOKING</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEALTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK-FACTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURGERY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PUBLICATION BIAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASSOCIATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIFE-STYLE FACTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INHIBITS APOPTOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POSTOPERATIVE OUTCOMES</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>44706</publishedID><Artikel>Dietary, lifestyle, and genetic determinants of vitamin D status: a cross-sectional analysis from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Germany study</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Nutrition</Journal><ABSTr>Considerable variation in 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) in populations worldwide that seems to be independent of latitude has been reported. Therefore, we aimed to assess vitamin D status of a mid-aged German general population and to identify its dietary, lifestyle, anthropometric, and genetic determinants.

25(OH)D concentrations were measured by LC-MS/MS in plasma samples of a random subcohort of the German arm of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) comprising 2,100 subjects aged 35-65 years. Associations between potential predictors and 25(OH)D were assessed by linear regression models.

32.8 % of the variance in 25(OH)D was explained by a multivariable regression model, with season being the by far strongest predictor (semi-partial R (2): 14.6 %). Sex, waist circumference, leisure time physical activity, smoking, polymorphisms in the GC, CYP2R1, and DHCR7 genes, supplement use, exogenous hormone use, alcohol consumption, egg consumption, and fish consumption were significantly associated with 25(OH)D concentrations as well. However, none of these factors explained &gt; 2.3 % of the variance in 25(OH)D.

Even with a comprehensive set of genetic, anthropometric, dietary, and lifestyle correlates, not more than 32.8 % of the variation in 25(OH)D could be explained in the EPIC-Germany study, implying that vitamin D prediction scores may not provide an appropriate proxy for measured 25(OH)D. Food intake was only a weak predictor of 25(OH)D concentrations, while a strong seasonal fluctuation in 25(OH)D was shown.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>53 (3), 731-741</Feld596><PubVol>53</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>731</StrtPage><EndPage>741</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kuehn,T."

The underlying causal variants are expected to be predominantly common; however synthetic associations with rare, higher penetrance variants have been hypothesised though not yet observed. Here, we report detection of a novel common, low penetrance prostate cancer association at the HOXB locus at ch17q and show that this signal can actually be attributed to a previously identified rare, moderate penetrance coding variant (G84E) in HOXB13. This study therefore provides the first experimental evidence for the existence of synthetic associations in cancer and shows that where GWAS signals arise through this phenomenon, risk predictions derived using the tag SNP would substantially underestimate the relative risk conferred and overestimate the number of carriers of the causal variant. Synthetic associations at GWAS signals could therefore account for a proportion of the missing heritability of complex diseases.

The HOXB13 gene has been implicated in prostate cancer (PrCa) susceptibility. We performed a high resolution fine-mapping analysis to comprehensively evaluate the association between common genetic variation across the HOXB genetic locus at 17q21 and PrCa risk. This involved genotyping 700 SNPs using a custom Illumina iSelect array (iCOGS) followed by imputation of 3195 SNPs in 20,440 PrCa cases and 21,469 controls in The PRACTICAL consortium. We identified a cluster of highly correlated common variants situated within or closely upstream of HOXB13 that were significantly associated with PrCa risk, described by rs117576373 (OR 1.30, P = 2.62x10(-14)). Additional genotyping, conditional regression and haplotype analyses indicated that the newly identified common variants tag a rare, partially correlated coding variant in the HOXB13 gene (G84E, rs138213197), which has been identified recently as a moderate penetrance PrCa susceptibility allele. The potential for GWAS associations detected through common SNPs to be driven by rare causal variants with higher relative risks has long been proposed; however, to our knowledge this is the first experimental evidence for this phenomenon of synthetic association contributing to cancer susceptibility.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>10 (2), e1004129-</Feld596><PubVol>10</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>e1004129</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Saunders,E.J."

However, epigenetic silencing of episomal vector genomes reduces IDLV transgene expression levels and renders these safe vectors less efficient. Here, we describe for the first time a complete correction of factor IX deficiency in hemophilia B mice by IDLVs carrying a novel, highly potent human FIX (hFIX) cDNA. A 50-fold increase in hFIXcDNA potency was achieved by combining two mechanistically independent yet synergistic strategies: a) optimization of the hFIXcDNA codon-usage to increase hFIX protein production per vector genome, and b) generation of a highly catalytic mutant hFIX protein in which the arginine residue at position 338 was substituted with leucine. The enhanced hFIX activity was not associated with liver damage or with the formation of hFIX-directed inhibitory antibodies, and rendered IDLV-treated FIX knockout mice resistant to a challenging tail-clipping assay. A novel S1 nuclease-based B1-qPCR assay showed low levels of IDLV integration in mouse liver. Overall, this study demonstrates that IDLVs carrying an improvedhFIXcDNA safely and efficiently cure hemophilia B in a mouse model.Molecular Therapy (2013); doi:10.1038/mt.2013.188.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>22 (3), 567-574</Feld596><PubVol>22</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>567</StrtPage><EndPage>574</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Suwanmanee T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Hu G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Gui T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Bartholomae CC" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kutschera I" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="von Kalle C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Schmidt M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Monahan PE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Kafri T" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>23941813</PMID><DOI>10.1038/mt.2013.188</DOI><KST>G100</KST><KEYWORD>HUMAN-FACTOR-IX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CLINICAL GENE-THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PACKAGING CELL-LINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HIV</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSGENE EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENERATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EFFICIENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMMUNITY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>44872</publishedID><Artikel>Adiposity, mediating biomarkers and risk of colon cancer in the European prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition study</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Adiposity is a risk factor for colon cancer, but underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We evaluated the extent to which 11 biomarkers with inflammatory and metabolic actions mediate the association of adiposity measures, waist circumference (WC) and body mass index (BMI), with colon cancer in men and women. We analyzed data from a prospective nested case-control study among 662 incident colon cancer cases matched within risk sets to 662 controls. Relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using conditional logistic regression. The percent effect change and corresponding CIs were estimated after adjusting for biomarkers shown to be associated with colon cancer risk. After multivariable adjustment, WC was associated with colon cancer risk in men (top vs. bottom tertile RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.06-2.65; p(trend)=0.02) and in women (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.09-2.56; p(trend)=0.03). BMI was associated with risk only in men. The association of WC with colon cancer was accounted mostly for by three biomarkers, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, non-high-molecular-weight adiponectin and soluble leptin receptor, which in combination explained 46% (95% CI 37-57%) of the association in men and 50% (95% CI 40-65%) of the association in women. Similar results were observed for the associations with BMI in men. These data suggest that alterations in levels of these metabolic biomarkers may represent a primary mechanism of action in the relation of adiposity with colon cancer. Further studies are warranted to determine whether altering their concentrations may reduce colon cancer risk.

What's new? Adiposity is a well-established risk factor for colon cancer. However, the mechanisms that underlie this relationship still aren't well understood. In this study, the authors evaluated a panel of inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers for their impact on colon-cancer risk. They found that serum levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, non-high-molecular-weight adiponectin, and soluble leptin receptor had the greatest impact on the association between adiposity and colon cancer. These biomarkers may thus lead to promising strategies for the targeted prevention of colon cancer.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>134 (3), 612-621</Feld596><PubVol>134</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>612</StrtPage><EndPage>621</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Aleksandrova, K."

We investigated whether the associations between lifestyle factors and mortality risk differ between individuals with and without diabetes.

Methods Within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), a cohort was formed of 6,384 persons with diabetes and 258,911 EPIC participants without known diabetes. Joint Cox proportional hazard regression models of people with and without diabetes were built for the following lifestyle factors in relation to overall mortality risk: BMI, waist/height ratio, 26 food groups, alcohol consumption, leisure-time physical activity, smoking. Likelihood ratio tests for heterogeneity assessed statistical differences in regression coefficients.

Results Multivariable adjusted mortality risk among individuals with diabetes compared with those without was increased, with an HR of 1.62 (95% CI 1.51, 1.75). Intake of fruit, legumes, nuts, seeds, pasta, poultry and vegetable oil was related to a lower mortality risk, and intake of butter and margarine was related to an increased mortality risk. These associations were significantly different in magnitude from those in diabetes-free individuals, but directions were similar. No differences between people with and without diabetes were detected for the other lifestyle factors.

Conclusions/interpretation Diabetes status did not substantially influence the associations between lifestyle and mortality risk. People with diabetes may benefit more from a healthy diet, but the directions of association were similar. Thus, our study suggests that lifestyle advice with respect to mortality for patients with diabetes should not differ from recommendations for the general population.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>57 (1), 63-72</Feld596><PubVol>57</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>63</StrtPage><EndPage>72</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Sluik, D."

Higher tumorigenicity of cells is associated with earlier tumor onset. Here, we used xenotransplantation to assess the tumorigenic potential of human breast cancer cells following RNA interference-mediated inhibition of over 5000 genes. We identify 16 candidate tumor suppressors, one of which is the zinc-finger transcription factor SALL1. Analyzing this particular molecule in more detail, we show that inhibition of SALL1 correlates with reduced levels of CDH1, an important contributor to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Furthermore, SALL1 expression led to an increased migration and more than twice as many cells expressing a cancer stem cell signature. Also, SALL1 expression correlates with the survival of breast cancer patients. These findings cast new light on a gene that has previously been described to be relevant during embryogenesis, but not carcinogenesis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>33 (33), 4273-4278</Feld596><PubVol>33</PubVol><PubIss>33</PubIss><StrtPage>4273</StrtPage><EndPage>4278</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Wolf,J."

S1444 in the ROC domain was confirmed as a target for PKA phosphorylation using ROC single-domain constructs and through site-directed mutagenesis. Phosphorylation at S1444 is strikingly reduced in the major PD-related LRRK2 mutations R1441C/G/H, which are part of a consensus PKA recognition site ((1441)RASpS(1444)). Furthermore, our work establishes S1444 as a PKA-regulated 14-3-3 docking site. Experiments of direct binding to the three 14-3-3 iso-types gamma, theta, and zeta with phosphopeptides encompassing pS910, pS935, or pS1444 demonstrated the highest affinities to phospho-S1444. Strikingly, 14-3-3 binding to phospho-S1444 decreased LRRK2 kinase activity in vitro. Moreover, substitution of S1444 by alanine or by introducing the mutations R1441C/G/H, abrogating PKA phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding, resulted in increased LRRK2 kinase activity. In conclusion, these data clearly demonstrate that LRRK2 kinase activity is modulated by PKA-mediated binding of 14-3-3 to S1444 and suggest that 14-3-3 interaction with LRRK2 is hampered in R1441C/G/H-mediated PD pathogenesis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>111 (1), E34-E43</Feld596><PubVol>111</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>E34</StrtPage><EndPage>E43</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Muda K."

Activation of procaspase-8 within the DISC and its release from the signaling complex is required for processing executor caspases and commiting cell death. Here, we report that the atypical cadherin FAT1 interacts with caspase-8 preventing the association of caspase-8 with the DISC. We identified FAT1 in a genome-wide siRNA screen for synthetic lethal interactions with death receptor-mediated apoptosis. Knockdown of FAT1 sensitized established and patient-derived glioblastoma cell lines for apoptosis transduced by cell death ligands. Depletion of FAT1 resulted in enhanced procaspase-8 recruitment to the DISC and increased formation of caspase-8 containing secondary signaling complexes. In addition, FAT1 knockout cell lines generated by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome engineering were more susceptible for death receptor-mediated apoptosis. Our findings provide evidence for a mechanism to control caspase-8-dependent cell death by the atypical cadherin FAT1. These results contribute towards the understanding of effector caspase regulation in physiological conditions.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>33 (3), 181-197</Feld596><PubVol>33</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>181</StrtPage><EndPage>197</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kranz,D."

Activated MCs instantly release preformed inflammatory mediators, including several proteases. The chymase mouse mast cell protease (MCPT)-4 is thought to be pro-inflammatory, whereas human chymase also degrades pro-inflammatory cytokines, suggesting that chymase instead limits inflammation. Here we explored the contribution of MCPT4 and human chymase to the control of danger-induced inflammation. We found that protein extracts from wild type (WT), carboxypeptidase A3-, and MCPT6-deficient mice and MCs and recombinant human chymase efficiently degrade the Trichinella spiralis virulence factor heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) as well as endogenous Hsp70. MC-(W-sash)-, serglycin-, NDST2-, and MCPT4-deficient extracts lacked this capacity, indicating that chymase is responsible for the degradation. Chymase, but not MC tryptase, also degraded other alarmins, i.e. biglycan, HMGB1, and IL-33, a degradation that was efficiently blocked by the chymase inhibitor chymostatin. IL-7, IL-22, GM-CSF, and CCL2 were resistant to chymase degradation. MCPT4-deficient conditions ex vivo and in vivo showed no reduction in added Hsp70 and only minor reduction of IL-33. Peritoneal challenge with Hsp70 resulted in increased neutrophil recruitment and TNF- levels in the MCPT4-deficient mice, whereas IL-6 and CCL2 levels were similar to the levels found in WT mice. The rapid and MC chymase-specific degradation of virulence factors and alarmins may depend on the presence of accessible extended recognition cleavage sites in target substrates and suggests a protective and regulatory role of MC chymase during danger-induced inflammation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>289 (1), 237-250</Feld596><PubVol>289</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>237</StrtPage><EndPage>250</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Roy A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Ganesh G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Sippola H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Bolin S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Sawesi O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Dagalv A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Schlenner SM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Feyerabend T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Rodewald HR" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Kjellen L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Hellman L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Abrink M."

However, unlike PET/CT, PET/MR ignores the contribution of cortical bone in the attenuation map. Thus, the aims of this study were to evaluate the diagnostic performance of whole-body integrated 18F-FDG PET/MR specifically for bone lesions and to analyze differences in standardized uptake value (SUV) quantification between PET/MR and PET/CT.

METHODS:
One hundred nineteen patients with 18F-FDG-avid primary malignancies underwent a single-injection, dual-imaging protocol using 18F-FDG on a PET/CT scanner and a subsequent PET/MR scan with a T1-weighted volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination (VIBE) Dixon sequence for attenuation correction and an unenhanced coronal T1-weighted turbo spin-echo (TSE) sequence for bone analysis. Three sets of images (CT with PET [from PET/CT; set A], T1-weighted VIBE Dixon with PET [set B], and T1-weighted TSE with PET [both from PET/MR; set C]) were analyzed. Two readers rated every lesion using a 4-point scale for lesion conspicuity on PET, a 4-point scale for anatomic allocation of PET-positive lesions, and a 5-point scale for the nature of every lesion based on its appearance on morphologic imaging and uptake on PET. For all lesions and for representative regions of normal bone, SUV analysis was performed for PET/MR and PET/CT.

RESULTS:
In total, 98 bone lesions were identified in 33 of 119 patients, and 630 regions of normal bone were analyzed. Visual lesion conspicuity on PET was comparable for PET/CT (mean rating, 2.82 +- 0.45) and PET/MR (2.75 +- 0.51; P = 0.3095). Anatomic delineation and allocation of suggestive lesions was significantly superior with T1-weighted TSE MRI (mean rating, 2.84 +- 0.42) compared with CT (2.57 +- 0.54, P = 0.0001) or T1-weighted VIBE Dixon MRI (2.57 +- 0.54, P = 0.0002). No significant difference in correct classification of malignant bone lesions was found among sets A (85/90), B (84/90), and C (86/90). For bone lesions and regions of normal bone, a highly significant correlation existed between the mean SUVs for PET/MR and PET/CT (R = 0.950 and 0.917, respectively, each P &lt; 0.001). However, substantially lower mean SUVs were found for PET/MR than for PET/CT both for bone lesions (12.4% +- 15.5%) and for regions of normal bone (30.1% +- 27.5%).

CONCLUSION:
Compared with PET/CT, fully integrated whole-body 18F-FDG PET/MR is technically and clinically robust for evaluation of bone lesions despite differences in attenuation correction. PET/MR, including diagnostic T1-weighted TSE sequences, was superior to PET/CT for anatomic delineation and allocation of bone lesions. This finding might be of clinical relevance in selected cases-for example, primary bone tumors, early bone marrow infiltration, and tumors with low uptake on PET. Thus, a diagnostic T1-weighted TSE sequence is recommended as a routine protocol for oncologic PET/MR.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>55 (2), 191-197</Feld596><PubVol>55</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>191</StrtPage><EndPage>197</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Eiber M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Takei T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Souvatzoglou M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Mayerhoefer ME" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Fuerst S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Gaertner FC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Loeffelbein DJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Rummeny EJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Ziegler SI" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Schwaiger M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Beer AJ" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24309383</PMID><DOI>10.2967/jnumed.113.123646</DOI><KST>L701</KST><KEYWORD>hybrid imaging</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PET/MR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>bone lesion</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Detection</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUV</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PET/CT</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>45056</publishedID><Artikel>Knockout and humanized mice as suitable tools to identify enzymes metabolizing the human carcinogen aristolochic acid</Artikel><Journal>Xenobiotica</Journal><ABSTr>Abstract 1. Aristolochic acid I (AAI) is the predominant component in plant extract of Aristolochia genus that is involved in development of aristolochic acid nephropathy, Balkan endemic nephropathy and urothelial cancer. The diseases do not develop in all individuals exposed to AAI and patients exhibit different clinical outcomes. Differences in the activities of enzymes catalyzing the metabolism of AAI might be one of the reasons for this individual susceptibility. 2. Understanding which human enzymes are involved in reductive activation of AAI generating AAI-DNA adducts, and/or its detoxication to the O-demethylated metabolite, aristolochic acid Ia (AAIa), is necessary in the assessment of the susceptibility to this compound. 3. This review summarizes the results of the latest studies utilizing genetically engineered mouse models to identify which human and rodent enzymes catalyze the reductive activation of AAI to AAI-DNA adducts and its oxidative detoxication to AAIa in vivo. 4.

Cell death induced by ellipticine has been shown to engage a p53-dependent pathway, cell cycle arrest, interaction with several kinases and induction of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptotic cell death. Cell cycle arrest was shown to result from DNA damage caused by a variety of tumor chemotherapeutic agents; this is also the case for ellipticines. The prevalent DNA-mediated mechanisms of anti-tumor, mutagenic and cytotoxic activities of ellipticine are (i) intercalation into DNA, (ii) inhibition of DNA topoisomerase II activity, and (iii) covalent binding to DNA in vitro and in vivo after enzymatic activation by cytochrome P450 and/or peroxidase enzymes The mechanism leading to apoptosis by ellipticine is thought to also be associated with DNA damage, by inhibition of topoisomerase II and the covalent modification of DNA. In addition, the formation of ellipticine-DNA adducts ultimately can mutate cancer cells or initiate cell death. The aim of this review is to summarize our knowledge on the molecular mechanisms with the aim to explain the effectiveness of ellipticines as DNA-targeted chemotherapeutics in cancer cells.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>21 (5), 575-591</Feld596><PubVol>21</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>575</StrtPage><EndPage>591</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Stiborova M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Frei E" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24059226</PMID><KST>G110</KST><KEYWORD>CELL-CYCLE ARREST</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HISTONE DEACETYLASE INHIBITORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADVANCED BREAST-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CARCINOGEN ARISTOLOCHIC ACID</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CYTOCHROMES P450 1A1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>XENOBIOTIC-METABOLIZING ENZYMES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANTICANCER DRUG ELLIPTICINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENDOMETRIAL CANCER-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PEROXIDASE-MEDIATED OXIDATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>45124</publishedID><Artikel>Is nano too big?</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>41 (1), 4-6</Feld596><PubVol>41</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>4</StrtPage><EndPage>6</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Mier,W."

Methods: Osteoporosis was induced by ovariectomy and a calcium restricted diet. After three months, rats were operated to create a 4 mm defect in the distal metaphyseal femur with internal fixation. 7 Rats have been treated either with CPC (Group 2) or with SrCPC (Group 3) for bone replacement and defect healing. Furthermore, a control group of 7 rats without any biomaterial (Group 1) was used for reference. 18 weeks after osteoporosis induction and 6 weeks following femoral surgery, dPET-CT studies scan were performed with 18F-Sodium Fluoride. SUVs and a 2-tissue compartmental learning-machine model (K1-k4, VB, influx) were used for quantitative analysis. Results: VB, reflecting the fractional blood volume and k3, reflecting the formation of fluoroapatite were the most sensitive parameters for the characterisation of healing process and revealed the best differentiation for the control group and the CPC group (Group 2) as well as for the CPC with strontium carbonate group (Group 3) (p &lt; 0.05). VB was decreased by the order of Group1, Group 2 and Group3, while k3 was increased by the same order. Therefore, the data direct to a decreased fractional blood volume and increased fixation of fluoride in rats with these biomaterials. Conclusion: We found PET scanning using F-18-Sodium Fluoride to be a sensitive and useful method for evaluation of bone healing after replacement with CPC or SrCPC.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>45 (3), 501-505</Feld596><PubVol>45</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>501</StrtPage><EndPage>505</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Cheng,C."

In this study, we use genetic tools to report novel roles for GzmB as an important regulator of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function in response to stress. HSCs lacking the GzmB gene show improved bone marrow (BM) reconstitution associated with increased HSC proliferation and mitochondrial activity. In addition, recipients deficient in GzmB support superior engraftment of wild-type HSCs compared with hosts with normal BM niches. Stimulation of mice with lipopolysaccharide strongly induced GzmB protein expression in HSCs, which was mediated by the TLR4-TRIF-p65 NF-kappa B pathway. This is associated with increased cell death and GzmB secretion into the BM environment, suggesting an extracellular role of GzmB in modulating HSC niches. Moreover, treatment with the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) also induces GzmB production in HSCs. In this situation GzmB is not secreted, but instead causes cell-autonomous apoptosis. Accordingly, GzmB-deficient mice are more resistant to serial 5-FU treatments. Collectively, these results identify GzmB as a negative regulator of HSC function that is induced by stress and chemotherapy in both HSCs and their niches. Blockade of GzmB production may help to improve hematopoiesis in various situations of BM stress.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>211 (5), 769-779</Feld596><PubVol>211</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>769</StrtPage><EndPage>779</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Carnevalli, LC" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Scognamiglio, R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Cabezas-Wallscheid, N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Rahmig, S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Masuda, K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Laurenti, E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Joeckel, L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Thamm, S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Erlacher, M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Pasparakis, M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Essers, M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Trumpp, A" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24752302</PMID><DOI>10.1084/jem.20131072</DOI><KST>A010</KST><KST>A011</KST><KEYWORD>SELF-RENEWAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>KNOCKOUT MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VERSUS-HOST-DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>C-MYC</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEMATOPOIETIC STEM-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CLEAVAGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INFECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CYTOLYTIC LEUKOCYTES</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>45164</publishedID><Artikel>Effect of multiplicity, laterality and age at onset of breast cancer on familial risk of breast cancer: A nationwide prospective cohort study</Artikel><Journal>Breast Cancer Research and Treatment</Journal><ABSTr>The objective of this nationwide prospective cohort study is to find out the risk of breast cancer (BC) in relatives of patients with multiple BCs by laterality and age at diagnosis of first BC. Having family history of single (HR 1.8; 95 % CI 1.8-1.9) or multiple (HR 2.7; 95 % CI 2.6-2.9) BC was associated with higher risk of BC. Those with an FDR with contralateral BC at any age had the highest risk of familial cancer except at age &lt; 40 in which those whose young FDR was affected by multiple ipsilateral BC had the highest risk (HR 9.7; 95 % CI 6.0-15.6). The familial risk of BC in these families decreased as the subject's and FDRs' age at diagnosis of first BC increased. The HR was still significantly increased (2.2) for old individuals (&gt; 60) having a FDR with contralateral BC at an advanced age (a parts per thousand yen80). Despite the common belief that later onset breast cancer is more associated with sporadic breast cancer, our data suggest that breast cancer at any age in the family is associated with some increase in the familial risk, though that risk decreases as the age of onset increases. Contralateral and multiple ipsilateral breast cancers might be associated with distinct shared familial risk factors. Our results have implication for genetic counseling and urge gene identification studies.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>144 (1), 185-192</Feld596><PubVol>144</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>185</StrtPage><EndPage>192</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kharazmi E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Chen T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Narod S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Sundquist K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Hemminki K" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24487690</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s10549-014-2848-3</DOI><KST>C050</KST><KEYWORD>HISTORY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>YOUNG</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BRCA2 MUTATION CARRIERS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>45167</publishedID><Artikel>The population impact of familial cancer, a major cause of cancer</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>The population attributable fraction (PAF) defines the proportion of a disease that would be prevented if the exposure to a particular risk factor was avoided. Familial risk is a known risk factor for many cancers, but an unbiased estimation of the PAF for familial risk requires a large study population to include rare cancers. PAFs and their corresponding standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for familial relative risk among first-degree relatives (FDRs) and second-degree relatives (SDRs) diagnosed with the same (concordant) invasive or in situ cancers. Calculations were based on the Swedish Family-Cancer Database considering 8,148,737 individuals. To assess environmental effects, PAFs were also calculated for concordant cancers among spouses. Almost all cancers showed a significant familial risk. The highest PAFs were found for the common cancers of the prostate (13.94%), breast (7.46%) and colorectum (6.78%) among the FDRs. In the FDRs, the overall PAF for any concordant cancer was 4.20%, but in the SDRs, it was only 0.34%. The overall PAFs for in situ cancers were 0.86% and 0.56% for the FDRs and SDRs, respectively. The overall independent familial PAF was 5.96% for the invasive and in situ cancers in the FDRs and SDRs. The cancers between spouses yielded an overall PAF of 0.14%. For esophageal cancer, the risk among spouses was higher than the familial risk. Our study shows that the overall familial PAF of 5.96%, although underestimated for sex-specific cancers, ranks as the third most common population burden after tobacco smoking and unhealthy diet.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>134 (8), 1899-1906</Feld596><PubVol>134</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>1899</StrtPage><EndPage>1906</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Frank C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Fallah M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Ji J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Sundquist J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Hemminki K" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24590453</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28510</DOI><KST>C050</KST><KEYWORD>HUMAN CARCINOGENS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALCOHOL-DRINKING</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISKS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMMON</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DATABASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>smoking</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TOBACCO</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>45178</publishedID><Artikel>Cancer survival in Europe 1999-2007 by country and age: results of EUROCARE-5-a population-based study</Artikel><Journal>Lancet Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>Background Cancer survival is a key measure of the effectiveness of health-care systems. EUROCARE-the largest cooperative study of population-based cancer survival in Europe-has shown persistent differences between countries for cancer survival, although in general, cancer survival is improving. Major changes in cancer diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation occurred in the early 2000s. EUROCARE-5 assesses their effect on cancer survival in 29 European countries. Methods In this retrospective observational study, we analysed data from 107 cancer registries for more than 10 million patients with cancer diagnosed up to 2007 and followed up to 2008. Uniform quality control procedures were applied to all datasets. For patients diagnosed 2000-07, we calculated 5-year relative survival for 46 cancers weighted by age and country. We also calculated country-specific and age-specific survival for ten common cancers, together with survival differences between time periods (for 1999-2001, 2002-04, and 2005-07). Findings 5-year relative survival generally increased steadily over time for all European regions. The largest increases from 1999-2001 to 2005-07 were for prostate cancer (73.4% [95% CI 72.9-73.9] vs 81.7% [81.3-82.1]), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (53.8% [53.3-54.4] vs 60.4% [60.0-60.9]), and rectal cancer (52.1% [51.6-52.6] vs 57.6% [57.1-58.1]). Survival in eastern Europe was generally low and below the European mean, particularly for cancers with good or intermediate prognosis. Survival was highest for northern, central, and southern Europe. Survival in the UK and Ireland was intermediate for rectal cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, skin melanoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but low for kidney, stomach, ovarian, colon, and lung cancers. Survival for lung cancer in the UK and Ireland was much lower than for other regions for all periods, although results for lung cancer in some regions (central and eastern Europe) might be affected by overestimation. Survival usually decreased with age, although to different degrees depending on region and cancer type. Interpretation The major advances in cancer management that occurred up to 2007 seem to have resulted in improved survival in Europe. Likely explanations of differences in survival between countries include: differences in stage at diagnosis and accessibility to good care, different diagnostic intensity and screening approaches, and differences in cancer biology. Variations in socioeconomic, lifestyle, and general health between populations might also have a role. Further studies are needed to fully interpret these findings and how to remedy disparities</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>15 (1), 23-34</Feld596><PubVol>15</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>23</StrtPage><EndPage>34</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="De Angelis R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Sant M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Coleman MP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Francisci S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Baili P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Pierannunzio D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Trama A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Visser O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Ardanaz E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Bielska-Lasota M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Engholm G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Nennecke A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Siesling S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Berrino F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Capocaccia R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="the EUROCARE-5 Working Group" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24314615</PMID><DOI>10.1016/S1470-2045(13)70546-1</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>BREAST-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OVARIAN-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIAGNOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MORTALITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMPACT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGRESS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENGLAND</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MANAGEMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BENCHMARKING PARTNERSHIP</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>45196</publishedID><Artikel>Efficient keratinocyte differentiation strictly depends on JNK induced soluble factors in fibroblasts</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Investigative Dermatology</Journal><ABSTr>Previous studies demonstrated that fibroblast-derived and JUN-dependent soluble factors have a crucial role on keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation during cutaneous wound healing. Furthermore, mice with a deficiency in Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), JNK1 or JNK2, showed impaired skin development and delayed wound closure. To decipher the role of dermal JNK in keratinocyte behavior during these processes, we used a heterologous coculture model combining primary human keratinocytes and murine fibroblasts. Although cocultured JNK1/JNK2-deficient fibroblasts did not affect keratinocyte proliferation, temporal monitoring of the transcriptome of differentiating keratinocytes revealed that efficient keratinocyte differentiation not only requires the support by fibroblast-derived soluble factors, but is also critically dependent on JNK1 and JNK2 signaling in these cells. Moreover, we showed that the repertoire of fibroblast transcripts encoding secreted proteins is severely disarranged upon loss of JNK under the coculture conditions applied. Finally, our data demonstrate that efficient keratinocyte terminal differentiation requires constant presence of JNK-dependent and fibroblast-derived soluble factors. Taken together, our results imply that mesenchymal JNK has a pivotal role in the paracrine cross talk between dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes during wound healing.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>134 (5), 1332-1341</Feld596><PubVol>134</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>1332</StrtPage><EndPage>1341</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schumacher, M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Schuster, C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Rogon, ZM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Bauer, T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Caushaj, N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Baars, S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Szabowski, S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Bauer, C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Schorpp-Kistner, M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Hess, J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Holland-Cunz, S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Wagner, EF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Eils, R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Angel, P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="14" name="Hartenstein, B" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24335928</PMID><DOI>10.1038/jid.2013.535</DOI><KST>A100</KST><KST>B080</KST><KEYWORD>EPIDERMAL-KERATINOCYTES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MORPHOGENESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MAP KINASES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION PATHWAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SKIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>C-JUN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>proliferation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH-FACTOR</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>45207</publishedID><Artikel>Surgical navigation in urology: European perspective</Artikel><Journal>Current Opinion in Urology</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Use of virtual reality to navigate open and endoscopic surgery has significantly evolved during the last decade. Current status of seven most interesting projects inside the European Association of Urology section of uro-technology is summarized with review of literature. RECENT FINDINGS: Marker-based endoscopic tracking during laparoscopic radical prostatectomy using high-definition technology reduces positive margins. Marker-based endoscopic tracking during laparoscopic partial nephrectomy by mechanical overlay of three-dimensional-segmented virtual anatomy is helpful during planning of trocar placement and dissection of renal hilum. Marker-based, iPAD-assisted puncture of renal collecting system shows more benefit for trainees with reduction of radiation exposure. Three-dimensional laser-assisted puncture of renal collecting system using Uro-Dyna-CT realized in an ex-vivo model enables minimal radiation time. Electromagnetic tracking for puncture of renal collecting system using a sensor at the tip of ureteral catheter worked in an in-vivo model of porcine ureter and kidney. Attitude tracking for ultrasound-guided puncture of renal tumours by accelerometer reduces the puncture error from 4.7 to 1.8 mm. Feasibility of electromagnetic and optical tracking with the da Vinci telemanipulator was shown in vitro as well as using in-vivo model of oesophagectomy. Target registration error was 11.2 mm because of soft-tissue deformation. SUMMARY: Intraoperative navigation is helpful during percutaneous puncture collecting system and biopsy of renal tumour using various tracking techniques. Early clinical studies demonstrate advantages of marker-based navigation during laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and partial nephrectomy. Combination of different tracking techniques may further improve this interesting addition to video-assisted surgery.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>24 (1), 81-97</Feld596><PubVol>24</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>81</StrtPage><EndPage>97</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Rassweiler J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Rassweiler MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Mueller M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kenngott H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Meinzer HP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Teber D" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24280651</PMID><DOI>10.1097/MOU.0000000000000014</DOI><KST>E130</KST><KEYWORD>SURGERY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPERIENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ultrasound</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LAPAROSCOPIC RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>augmented reality</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MINIMALLY INVASIVE ESOPHAGECTOMY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>URO DYNA-CT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PERCUTANEOUS ACCESS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SHOCK-WAVE LITHOTRIPSY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>45238</publishedID><Artikel>Comparison of the Immunogenicity and Reactogenicity of Cervarix(R) and Gardasil(R) Human Papillomavirus Vaccines in HIV-infected Adults: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Clinical Trial</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Infectious Diseases</Journal><ABSTr>Background. We compared the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of Cervarix or Gardasil human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines in adults infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

Methods. This was a double-blind, controlled trial randomizing HIV-positive adults to receive 3 doses of Cervarix or Gardasil at 0, 1.5, and 6 months. Immunogenicity was evaluated for up to 12 months. Neutralizing anti-HPV-16/18 antibodies were measured by pseudovirion-based neutralization assay. Laboratory tests and diary cards were used for safety assessment. The HPV-DNA status of the participants was determined before and after immunization.

Results. Ninety-two participants were included in the study. Anti-HPV-18 antibody titers were higher in the Cervarix group compared with the Gardasil group at 7 and 12 months. No significant differences in anti-HPV-16 antibody titers were found among vaccine groups. Among Cervarix vaccinees, women had higher anti-HPV-16/18 antibody titers compared to men. No sex-specific differences in antibody titers were found in the Gardasil group. Mild injection site reactions were more common in the Cervarix group than in the Gardasil group (91.1% vs 69.6%; P = .02). No serious adverse events occurred.

Conclusions. Both vaccines were immunogenic and well tolerated.

We tested whether the increase of oxygen delivery induced in vivo by myo-inositol trispyrophosphate (ITPP) can reverse hypoxia, control tumor growth and improve chemotherapy response. Tumor size, metastatic development (microcomputed tomography scan follow-up) and the survival of rats and nude or NOD.SCID mice, (bearing syngenic rat and MiaPaCa2- or patient-derived pancreatic tumors), were determined on ITPP and/or gemcitabine treatment. Partial oxygen pressure, expression of angiogenic factors and tumor histology were evaluated. Infiltration and oxidative status of immune cells, as well as chemotherapy penetration in tumors, were determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, fluorometry, nitric oxide release assays, Western blot and confocal microscopy. Weekly intravenous ITPP application resulted in the inhibition of metastasis development and restricted primary tumor growth, showing a superior effect on the rats' survival compared with gemcitabine. ITPP treatment restored tumor normoxia and caused a reduction in hypoxia inducible factor-1 levels, with subsequent VEGF and Lox downregulation, resulting in improved vessel structure and decreased desmoplasia. The latter effects translated into elevated immune cells influx and improved susceptibility to gemcitabine treatment. Growth of human pancreatic tumor xenografts was strongly inhibited by administration of ITPP. ITPP exploits a two-stage mechanism causing rapid, early and sustainable late stage normoxia. This is due to the angiogenic factor modulation and vascular normalization, leading to enhanced chemotherapy delivery and synergistic life prolongation, on combination with low doses of gemcitabine.

Pancreatic tumors are highly hypoxic, owing to extensive stromal reaction and disturbed angioarchitecture, features that also reduce the uptake of chemotherapeutics and hinder the flow of immune cells into tumors. In this study, treatment with myo-inositol trispyrophosphate (ITPP), a novel investigational drug (approved for Phase I and II clinical use in humans), was found to reverse hypoxia in rodents with pancreatic tumors. Therapy-induced reduction of HIF-1 and VEGF levels resulted in improved vessel structure. ITPP was active especially upon combination with standard gemcitabine chemotherapy. The latter protocol resulted in significant control of metastatic growth, life prolongation, and improved penetration of chemotherapy in tested animals.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>134 (11), 2572-2582</Feld596><PubVol>134</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>2572</StrtPage><EndPage>2582</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Raykov, Z."

Circulating insulin concentrations reflect the metabolic cardiovascular risk and may trigger weight gain. We aimed at identifying parental and childhood factors which may influence fasting plasma insulin concentrations in children.

Methods: The Ulm Birth Cohort study (UBCS) is a prospective birth cohort study. At baseline, birth characteristics, maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) values as well as parental socioeconomic parameters were obtained. At the 8-yr follow-up examination, weights, heights, and fasting plasma insulin concentrations in n = 422 children and their parents were measured. Offspring of women with gestational diabetes mellitus were excluded from statistical analysis.

Results: Fasting plasma insulin concentrations of children were significantly correlated with maternal pre-pregnancy BMI values (r = 0.16) as well as with maternal (r = 0.26) but not with paternal fasting plasma insulin concentrations (r = 0.11) at the 8-yr follow-up examination. The risk for high fasting plasma insulin concentrations (&gt;= 75th internal percentile) was 2.30 (1.34-3.92) in children who also had high plasma insulin concentrations in umbilical cord blood compared to children having lower plasma insulin concentrations (&lt; 75th internal percentile) in umbilical cord blood. In addition, we observed that children with high fasting plasma insulin concentrations at the age of 8 had an altered BMI trajectory in childhood, characterized by higher BMI values from the age of 1 onwards, compared to children with lower insulin concentrations.

Conclusion: Our observations support the hypothesis of perinatal programming of offspring insulin concentrations and BMI values by maternal pre-pregnancy BMI values.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>15 (6), 453-463</Feld596><PubVol>15</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>453</StrtPage><EndPage>463</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Brandt S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Moß A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Lennerz B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Koenig W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Weyermann M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Rothenbacher D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Wabitsch M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24433290</PMID><DOI>10.1111/pedi.12109</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>EPIGENETIC MECHANISMS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Mothers</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Hyperinsulinism</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WEIGHT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OBESITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>sensitivity</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHILDREN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISKS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GESTATIONAL DIABETES-MELLITUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HYPOTHALAMIC NUCLEI</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>45322</publishedID><Artikel>STROGAR - STrengthening the Reporting Of Genetic Association studies in Radiogenomics</Artikel><Journal>Radiotherapy and Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>Despite publication of numerous radiogenomics studies to date, positive single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations have rarely been reproduced in independent validation studies. A major reason for these inconsistencies is a high number of false positive findings because no adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. It is also possible that some validation studies were false negatives due to methodological shortcomings or a failure to reproduce relevant details of the original study. Transparent reporting is needed to ensure these flaws do not hamper progress in radiogenomics. In response to the need for improving the quality of research in the area, the Radiogenomics Consortium produced an 18-item checklist for reporting radiogenomics studies. It is recognised that not all studies will have recorded all of the information included in the checklist. However, authors should report on all checklist items and acknowledge any missing information. Use of STROGAR guidelines will advance the field of radiogenomics by increasing the transparency and completeness of reporting.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>110 (1), 182-188</Feld596><PubVol>110</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>182</StrtPage><EndPage>188</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kerns, S.L."

Our aim was to determine a specific protein expression profile of stromal angiogenic cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to identify potential biomarkers or new therapy targets.Methods:Frozen tissue of primary colorectal cancer (n=25), liver (n=25) and lung metastases (n=23) was laser-microdissected to obtain tumour epithelial cells and adjacent tumour-associated stroma. Protein expression of nine angiogenic cytokines and eight MMPs was analysed using a multiplex-based protein assay.Results:We found a differential expression of several MMPs and angiogenic cytokines in tumour cells compared with adjacent tumour stroma. Cluster analysis displayed a tumour-site-dependent stromal expression of MMPs and angiogenic cytokines. Univariate analysis identified stromal MMP-2 and MMP-3 in primary colorectal cancer, stromal MMP-1, -2, -3 and Angiopoietin-2 in lung metastases and stromal MMP-12 and VEGF in liver metastases as prognostic markers (P&gt;0.05, respectively). Furthermore, stroma-derived Angiopoietin-2 proved to be an independent prognostic marker in colorectal lung metastases.Conclusion:Expression of MMPs and angiogenic cytokines in tumour cells and adjacent tumour stroma is dependent on the tumour site. Stroma-derived MMPs and angiogenic cytokines may be useful prognostic biomarkers.

The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of folic acid (FA) fortification of the US food supply on leukocyte global DNA methylation and the relationship between DNA methylation, red blood cell (RBC) folate, and other one-carbon biomarkers among postmenopausal women enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study. We selected 408 women from the highest and lowest tertiles of RBC folate distribution matching on age and timing of the baseline blood draw, which spanned the pre- (1994-1995), peri- (1996-1997), or post-fortification (1998) periods. Global DNA methylation was assessed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and expressed as a percentage of total cytosine. We observed an interaction (P = 0.02) between fortification period and RBC folate in relation to DNA methylation. Women with higher (vs. lower) RBC folate had higher mean DNA methylation (5.12 vs. 4.99%; P = 0.05) in the pre-fortification period, but lower (4.95 vs. 5.16%;P = 0.03) DNA methylation in the post-fortification period. We also observed significant correlations between one-carbon biomarkers and DNA methylation in the pre-fortification period, but not in the peri- or post-fortification period. The correlation between plasma homocysteine and DNA methylation was reversed from the inverse (pre-fortification period) to the positive (post-fortification period) relationship. Our data suggest that (1) during FA fortification, higher RBC folate status is associated with a reduction in leukocyte global DNA methylation among postmenopausal women and; (2) the relationship between one-carbon biomarkers and global DNA methylation is dependent on folate availability.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (3), 396-403</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>396</StrtPage><EndPage>403</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Bae S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Ulrich CM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bailey LB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Malysheva O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Brown EC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Neuhouser ML" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Cheng TY" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Miller JW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Zheng Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Xiao L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Hou L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Song X" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Buck K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Beresford SA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Caudill MA" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24300587</PMID><DOI>10.4161/epi.27323</DOI><KST>G110</KST><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TANDEM MASS-SPECTROMETRY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DETERMINANTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REDUCTASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MODERATE FOLATE-DEPLETION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PLASMA HOMOCYSTEINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DECREASES</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>45350</publishedID><Artikel>Consideration of family history of cancer in medical routine: a survey in the primary care setting in Germany</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Cancer Prevention</Journal><ABSTr>Family history of cancer (FHC) is important in the context of cancer prevention and risk counselling, but there is a lack of information about its consideration in medical routine. We aimed to characterize how FHC is assessed and taken into account in the primary care setting in Germany. We conducted a mail survey among 285 office-based physicians in south-west Germany. We sent a questionnaire to randomly selected general practitioners, dermatologists, gastroenterologists, gynaecologists, urologists and pulmonologists, asking about collection of information on FHC and implications for preventive counselling. A total of 207 physicians returned the questionnaire (response rate 73%), of whom 71% reported asking for FHC routinely, 17% reported useing a standardized tool to collect the information and 35% reported regularly updating it. Implications of a positive FHC for counselling were heterogeneous, with priority on recommendations for screening. Referral to genetic counselling was considered by 34% of physicians, mainly gastroenterologists and gynaecologists. In the primary care setting in Germany, FHC is considered an important topic, but there is a lack of standardization in collecting the information and heterogeneity on the implications for counselling. Options to improve this situation, such as the implementation of standardized tools or centralized counselling systems, are needed.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (3), 199-205</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>199</StrtPage><EndPage>205</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Fiederling J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Ulrich CM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Hemminki K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Haug U" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>23880939</PMID><DOI>10.1097/CEJ.0b013e328364743d</DOI><KST>C050</KST><KST>G110</KST><KST>M110</KST><KEYWORD>PHYSICIANS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GUIDELINES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK-ASSESSMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>genetics</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUSCEPTIBILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TOOL</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>45358</publishedID><Artikel>Chromosomal gains and losses in human papillomavirus-associated neoplasia of the lower genital tract  - A systematic review and meta-analysis</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Background: Overexpression of the human papillomavirus (HPV) oncogenes E6 and E7 is necessary for the development of distinct lower genital tract cancers. However, secondary cellular genomic alterations are mandatory to promote progression of HPV-induced premalignant stages. We aimed at identifying the chromosomal regions most frequently gained and lost and the disease stage at which the latter occurs. These regions might be relevant for carcinogenesis and could serve as diagnostic markers to identify premalignant lesions with high progression risk towards invasive cancer.

Methods: We performed a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of studies listed in PubMed that analysed chromosomal copy number alterations by comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) in HPV-positive and -negative cancers or premalignant lesions of the anogenital tract (cervix, anus, vagina, penis and vulva).

Findings: Data were extracted and analysed from 32 studies. The most common alterations in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (12 studies, 293 samples) were gains at 3q with a rate of 0.55 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.43-0.70), losses at 3p (0.36, 95%CI 0.27-0.48) and losses at 11q (0.33, 95%CI 0.26-0.43). Gains at 3q were particularly frequent in HPV16-positive cervical SCC (0.84, 95%CI 0.78-0.90). Also more than one quarter of high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) harboured gains of 3q (0.27, 95%CI 0.20-0.36), but the rate in low grade CIN was low (0.02, 95%CI 0.00-0.09). For HPV-associated vulvar SCC (four studies, 30 samples) the same common alterations as in cervical SCC were reported. Studies on non-cervical and non-vulvar SCC and premalignant lesions of the lower genital tract are scarce.

Interpretation: 3q gains were most frequently found in HPV16-positive cervical SCC. The results suggest the selection of HPV-transformed cell clones harbouring 3q gains in high grade premalignant lesions, while alterations in low grade lesions are rare.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>50 (1), 85-98</Feld596><PubVol>50</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>85</StrtPage><EndPage>98</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Thomas,LK."

Hyperactive Src is a potent oncogene and a driver of cellular transformation and carcinogenesis. Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) is a tumor suppressor mediating growth suppression and apoptosis upon genotoxic stress through phosphorylation of p53 at Ser46. Here we show that Src phosphorylates HIPK2 and changes its subcellular localization. Using mass spectrometry we identified 9 Src-mediated Tyr-phosphorylation sites within HIPK2, 5 of them positioned in the kinase domain. By means of a phosphorylation-specific antibody we confirm that Src mediates phosphorylation of HIPK2 at Tyr354. We demonstrate that ectopic expression of Src increases the half-life of HIPK2 by interfering with Siah-1-mediated HIPK2 degradation. Moreover, we find that hyperactive Src binds HIPK2 and redistributes HIPK2 from the cell nucleus to the cytoplasm, where both kinases partially colocalize. Accordingly, we find that hyperactive Src decreases chemotherapeutic drug-induced p53 Ser46 phosphorylation and apoptosis activation. Together, our results suggest that Src kinase suppresses the apoptotic p53 pathway by phosphorylating HIPK2 and relocalizing the kinase to the cytoplasm.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>13 (1), 115-125</Feld596><PubVol>13</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>115</StrtPage><EndPage>125</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Polonio-Vallon T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Kirkpatrick J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Krijgsveld J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Hofmann TG."

The majority of colorectal cancers display chromosomal instability and follow the classical adenoma-carcinoma sequence of tumor progression. A subset of about 15 % of colorectal cancers, however, displays DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency and the high-level microsatellite instability (MSI-H) phenotype. MSI-H colorectal cancers can occur as sporadic tumors or in the context of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) or Lynch syndrome.

The MSI-H phenotype is a hallmark of Lynch syndrome-associated cancers, which is of diagnostic relevance for the identification of Lynch syndrome mutation carriers. MSI-H colorectal cancers are characterized by a distinct clinical behavior, which results from their particular molecular pathogenesis and gives microsatellite instability testing its clinical significance. The MSI-H phenotype shows association with proximal tumor localization, a dense local lymphocyte infiltration, and a low frequency of distant organ metastasis. Moreover, MSI-H colorectal cancers have a better prognosis than their microsatellite-stable counterparts. A distinct responsiveness of MSI-H colorectal cancer patients towards chemotherapy has been shown in several studies.

The clinical characteristics of MSI-H cancers are closely linked to their molecular pathogenesis, and research on the molecular alteration characteristic of MSI-H cancers may provide the basis for novel diagnostic or therapeutic approaches.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>399 (1), 23-31</Feld596><PubVol>399</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>23</StrtPage><EndPage>31</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kloor, M."

METHODS: In this intervention study, 40 patients with predominantly advanced NSCLC receiving simultaneous or sequential radio-chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone were enrolled. Over a period of eight weeks, patients were instructed to exercise at least 5x/week during the inpatient setting, and at least 3x/week in the outpatient setting. Physical performance status (endurance capacity: 6 minute-walk-test; strength capacity: handheld dynamometry), quality-of-life (FACT-L), fatigue (MFI) and depression (PHQ-9) were assessed at baseline (T0), after the exercise intervention (T1) and at a follow-up time point eight weeks later (T2). The primary endpoint was adequate adherence (feasibility) defined as completing at least two training sessions/week during a minimum of six weeks. RESULTS: 31/40 (77.5%) patients completed the post-exercise assessment (T1) and 22/40, the (55%) follow-up (T2). Stages were IIA 5%; IIIA 8%; IIIB 20%; IV 67%, and the median age was 63 years (range 22-75). Overall, adherence was 82% for those patients who completed T1, and 55% of the 40 patients participating, fulfilled the adequate adherence criterion. Those who completed the intervention showed a significant improvement in 6 minute-walk-distance and in knee-, elbow- and hip-muscle strength after the intervention (T1). Quality of life, fatigue and depression scores remained stable or declined slightly. Significant improvements in knee-muscle strength were also observed at T2. CONCLUSION: Exercise training is feasible in advanced and metastatic NSCLC patients during anticancer treatment. In this pilot study, endurance and strength capacity improved over time, indicating the rehabilitative importance of the applied intervention. To investigate the potential impact of exercise training in this patient group, a larger randomized trial is warranted.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>46 (4), 656-663</Feld596><PubVol>46</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>656</StrtPage><EndPage>663</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kuehr L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Wiskemann J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Abel U" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Ulrich CM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Hummler S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Thomas M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24042307</PMID><DOI>10.1249/MSS.0000000000000158</DOI><KST>G040</KST><KST>G110</KST><KEYWORD>FUNCTIONAL-CAPACITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WALK TEST</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INSTRUMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>QUALITY-OF-LIFE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RELIABILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SAFETY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FEASIBILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VALIDITY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>45488</publishedID><Artikel>The role of lipoxygenases in epidermis

LOX are also able to oxidize complex lipids and modify membrane structures leading to structural changes that play a role in the maturation and terminal differentiation of various cell types. The mammalian skin represents a tissue with highly abundant and diverse LOX metabolism. Individual LOX isozymes are thought to play a role in the modulation of epithelial proliferation and/or differentiation as well as in inflammation, wound healing, inflammatory skin diseases and cancer. Emerging evidence indicates a structural function of a particular LOX pathway in the maintenance of skin permeability barrier. Loss-of-function mutations in the LOX genes ALOX12B and ALOXE3 have been found to represent the second most common cause of autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis and targeted disruption of the corresponding LOX genes in mice resulted in neonatal death due to a severely impaired permeability barrier function. Recent data indicate that LOX action in barrier function can be traced back to the oxygenation of linoleate-containing ceramides which constitutes an important step in the formation of the corneocyte lipid envelope.

We examined the association between TSH and total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides in men and women from the general population. Furthermore, the association with TSH outside and within the reference range and lipid levels was studied. Methods: Individual data of 13,571 men and women without lipid medication of four population-based studies conducted in Western European adults were pooled for cross-sectional analyses. The association between TSH levels and lipid concentrations were analyzed by calculating sex-specific multivariable median regression models. Results: In the pooled population, serum TSH levels were significantly positively associated with triglyceride values in men and with total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride values in women. In the pooled male population, low serum TSH levels (&lt;3.0 mIU/L) were significantly associated with lower total cholesterol, while high serum TSH levels (&gt;= 3.0 mIU/L) were associated with higher triglyceride values. In the pooled female population, low serum TSH levels were significantly associated with lower total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol. High TSH levels were associated with higher total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in the pooled female population. In both sexes, serum TSH levels within the reference range (0.3-3.0 mIU/L) were significantly positively associated with triglyceride concentrations. Conclusions: Increasing levels of TSH were associated with a less favorable lipid profile in both men and women from the general population. In both sexes, TSH levels within the reference range were significantly positively associated with triglyceride concentrations.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>24 (3), 424-432</Feld596><PubVol>24</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>424</StrtPage><EndPage>432</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Meisinger, C."

via lysosomal recruitment of TSC2</Artikel><Journal>Cell</Journal><ABSTr>TOR complex 1 (TORC1) is a potent anabolic regulator of cellular growth and metabolism. When cells have sufficient amino acids, TORC1 is active due to its lysosomal localization mediated via the Rag GTPases. Upon amino acid removal, the Rag GTPases release TORC1, causing it to become cytoplasmic and inactive. We show here that, upon amino acid removal, the Rag GTPases also recruit TSC2 to the lysosome, where it can act on Rheb. Only when both the Rag GTPases and Rheb are inactive is TORC1 fully released from the lysosome. Upon amino acid withdrawal, cells lacking TSC2 fail to completely release TORC1 from the lysosome, fail to completely inactivate TORC1, and fail to adjust physiologically to amino acid starvation. These data suggest that regulation of TSC2 subcellular localization may be a general mechanism to control its activity and place TSC2 in the amino-acid-sensing pathway to TORC1.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>156 (4), 786-799</Feld596><PubVol>156</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>786</StrtPage><EndPage>799</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Demetriades, C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Doumpas, N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Teleman, AA" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24529380</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.cell.2014.01.024</DOI><KST>B140</KST><KEYWORD>DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>KINASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>mTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATING PROTEIN COMPLEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TSC1-TSC2 COMPLEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GAP ACTIVITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NULL-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUBERIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RHEB</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RAG GTPASES</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>45589</publishedID><Artikel>Limited Benefit of Fatmax-Test to Derive Training Prescriptions</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Sports Medicine</Journal><ABSTr>The intensity that elicits maximal fat oxidation (Fatmax) is recommended for training fat metabolism. However, it remains unclear whether Fatmax leads to the highest fat oxidation rates during prolonged exercise. It was hypothesized that there are no differences in fat oxidation rates among 3 different exercise intensities. Therefore, fat metabolism was compared among 1-h constant load tests at Fatmax, a higher and a lower intensity. A cohort of 16 male cyclists (28+/-6 yrs, BMI: 22.5+/-1.2 kg/m2; n=8 with maximal oxygen uptake [VO2max] of 50-60 ml/min/kg [ET]; n=8 with VO2max&gt;60 ml/min/kg [HET]) completed a maximal incremental cycling test, a submaximal incremental Fatmax-test and, thereafter, three 1-h constant-load tests in randomized order at Fatmax, one exercise stage below (LOW) and one above (HIGH). LOW, Fatmax and HIGH were performed at 52+/-13, 60+/-13 and 70+/-12% VO2max. Heart rate and blood lactate were significantly different (p&lt;0.001). However, the fat oxidation rate showed no difference (p=0.61). This was also true within each subgroup (ET: p=0.69, HET p=0.61). In conclusion, the fat oxidation rate of endurance trained cyclists shows no difference between 1-h constant load exercise bouts at about 50-70% VO2max. The precision and necessity of Fatmax-tests for controlling the training of fat oxidation are therefore debatable.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>35 (4), 280-285</Feld596><PubVol>35</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>280</StrtPage><EndPage>285</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schwindling S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Scharhag-Rosenberger F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kindermann W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Meyer T" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24022578</PMID><DOI>10.1055/s-0033-1349106</DOI><KST>G110</KST></row><row><publishedID>45644</publishedID><Artikel>Case-control study of genus-beta human papillomaviruses in plucked eyebrow hairs and cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>134 (9), 2231-2244</Feld596><PubVol>134</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>2231</StrtPage><EndPage>2244</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Iannacone,M.R."

Here we describe a new optical approach to measure fast redox signals with single-organelle resolution in living mice that express genetically encoded redox biosensors in their neuronal mitochondria. Moreover, we demonstrate how parallel measurements with several biosensors can integrate these redox signals into a comprehensive characterization of mitochondrial function. This approach revealed that axonal mitochondria undergo spontaneous 'contractions' that are accompanied by reversible redox changes. These contractions are amplified by neuronal activity and acute or chronic neuronal insults. Multiparametric imaging reveals that contractions constitute respiratory chain-dependent episodes of depolarization coinciding with matrix alkalinization, followed by uncoupling. In contrast, permanent mitochondrial damage after spinal cord injury depends on calcium influx and mitochondrial permeability transition. Thus, our approach allows us to identify heterogeneity among physiological and pathological redox signals, correlate such signals to functional and structural organelle dynamics and dissect the underlying mechanisms.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>20 (5), 555-560</Feld596><PubVol>20</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>555</StrtPage><EndPage>560</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Breckwoldt, M.O."

At enrollment participants completed lifestyle questionnaires and provided sera. Subjects were followed-up for a median of 9 years. Immunoassays were used to detect serum antibodies to Human Herpes Virus 2 (HHV-2), Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Chlamydia pneumoniae, L1 proteins of mucosal and cutaneous HPV types, E6/E7 proteins of HPV16/18, as well as to four polyomaviruses. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) [and 95% confidence intervals (CI)] for CIN3/CIS and ICC risk were respectively: 1.6 (1.2-2.0) and 1.8 (1.1-2.7) for L1 seropositivity to any mucosal HPV type, 1.0 (0.4-2.4) and 7.4 (2.8-19.7) for E6 seropositivity to HPV16/18, 1.3 (0.9-1.9) and 2.3 (1.3-4.1) for CT seropositivity, and 1.4 (1.0-2.0) and 1.5 (0.9-2.6) for HHV-2 seropositivity. The highest OR for ICC was observed for HPV16 E6 seropositivity [OR=10.2 (3.3-31.1)]. Increasing number of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) was associated with increasing risk. Non-STIs were not associated with CC risk. In conclusion, this large prospective study confirms the important role of HPV and a possible contribution of CT and HHV-2 in cervical carcinogenesis. It further identifies HPV16 E6 seropositivity as the strongest marker to predict ICC well before disease development.

What's New? Limited data are available from prospective studies concerning the role of past exposure to human papillomavirus (HPV) and other infections in cervical carcinogenesis. This study assessed associations between cervical cancer and pre-cancer and serological markers of exposure to mucosal and cutaneous HPVs, Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Chlamydia pneumonia, human herpes virus-2 (HHV-2), and polyomaviruses using a nested case-control design within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort. Associations were found for mucosal HPVs, CT, and HHV-2. A greater number of sexually transmitted diseases further raised the risk of cervical cancer.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>135 (2), 440-452</Feld596><PubVol>135</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>440</StrtPage><EndPage>452</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Castellsagué,X."

At baseline, participants completed a questionnaire and provided blood samples. During a mean follow-up time of 9 years, 261 ICC cases and 804 CIN3/CIS cases were reported. In a nested case-control study, the baseline sera from 609 cases and 1,218 matched controls were tested for L1 antibodies against HPV types 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 45, 52, 58, and antibodies against Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), and Human Herpes Virus 2 (HHV-2). Cervical samples were not available for HPV-DNA analysis in this study. Multivariate analyses were used to estimate associations between smoking and risk of CIN3/CIS and ICC in the cohort and the case-control studies. In the cohort analyses smoking status, duration and intensity showed a two-fold increased risk of CIN3/CIS and ICC, while time since quitting was associated with a two-fold reduced risk. In the nested case-control study, consistent associations were observed after adjustment for HPV, CT and HHV-2 serostatus, in both HPV seronegative and seropositive women. Results from this large prospective study confirm the role of tobacco smoking as an important risk factor for both CIN3/CIS and ICC, even after taking into account HPV exposure as determined by HPV serology. The strong beneficial effect of quitting smoking is an important finding that will further support public health policies for smoking cessation.

What's new? Tobacco smoking is a cited cause of cervical cancer, but whether it causes cervical malignancy independent of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is unclear. Here, strong associations were found between most measures of tobacco smoking and the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 3/carcinoma in situ and invasive cervical cancer, after taking into account past exposure to HPV infection. Quitting smoking was associated with a 2-fold risk reduction.

We examined these associations among 226 cases and 451 controls nested within a prospective cohort. Dietary intakes were calculated from validated food frequency questionnaires. Blood levels of 15 antibodies to Helicobacter pylori proteins were assessed using multiplex serology. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated using logistic regression. Among individuals infected with high-risk Helicobacter pylori (sero-positivity to 5-6 virulent H. pylori proteins), increasing intake of red meat, heme iron, and sodium increased risk (comparing highest tertile to lowest: ORs [95% confidence interval {CI}]: 1.85 [1.01-3.40]; 1.95 [1.06-3.57]; and 1.76 [0.91-3.43], respectively) while increasing intake of fruit decreased gastric cancer risk (comparing highest tertile of intake to lowest: OR [95% CI]: 0.52 [0.28-0.94]). No associations of diet with risk were found among individuals infected with low-risk H. pylori (P for interaction for red meat and sodium: 0.02 and 0.01, respectively). In this population with over 90% prevalence of CagA-positive H. pylori infection, categorizing individuals using H. pylori multiplex serology may identify individuals for whom a diet intervention may be effective.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>66 (4), 550-557</Feld596><PubVol>66</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>550</StrtPage><EndPage>557</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Epplein,M."

In contrast to other malignancies, pancreatic cancer is highly resistant to chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Therefore, new treatment options are urgently needed to improve the survival of patients with PDAC. Based on our data showing that patients with higher CD8+ T cell tumour infiltration exhibited prolonged overall and disease-free survival compared to patients with lower or without CD8+ T cell tumour infiltration, we suggested that immunotherapy could be a promising treatment option for PDAC. However, clinical data from the chemoradioimmunotherapy with interferon-alpha (IFN) trial did not point to an improved efficiency of chemoradiation combined with IFN as compared to chemoradiotherapy alone, suggesting an important role of the immune suppression induced by PDAC and/or unspecific immune stimulation. In support of this hypothesis, we found that the PDAC patients and experimental mice had an increased number of regulatory T cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. These results allowed us to conclude that PDAC provokes not only an anti-tumour immune response, but also strong immune suppression. Thus, we supposed that new immunotherapeutical strategies should involve not only stimulation of the immune system of PDAC patients, but also exert control over the tumour immune suppressive milieu.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>63 (1), 59-65</Feld596><PubVol>63</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>59</StrtPage><EndPage>65</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Bazhin AV" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Shevchenko I" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Umansky V" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Werner J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Karakhanova S" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24129765</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00262-013-1485-8</DOI><KST>G300</KST><KST>W430</KST><KEYWORD>folinic acid</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>carcinoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REGULATORY T-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BEARING MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GEMCITABINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHASE-III TRIAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUPPRESSOR-CELLS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>45787</publishedID><Artikel>Delayed closure of complex defects with serial tightening of loop sutures - clinical outcome in 64 consecutive patients</Artikel><Journal>Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Direct wound closure, flaps or grafts are considered to be gold standards for the reconstruction of defects. However, these techniques may not be applicable in all cases, especially for the challenging closure of large defects. OBJECTIVE: We developed a technique to close large defects, of varying size and shape, using serial tightening loop sutures. In 64 consecutive patients, loop sutures were applied to defects from 3 cm(2) up to 173 cm(2) for a maximum of 42 days with tightening every 2-7 days. RESULTS: The median size of the defects was 20 cm(2). In 58 patients (91%) the defects were closed by direct approximation of the wound edges within a median time of 11 days (range: 4-42 days). Two patients received a skin transplant after a significant reduction of the defect size and four remaining defects healed by secondary intention. The skin stretching of defects located on the trunk was faster compared with defects on the extremities. Defects located on the scalp were closed hair bearing with little scarring. Overall, aesthetic results were satisfying. CONCLUSION: The use of loop sutures allows the delayed closure of large defects avoiding the need for skin flaps or grafts in most cases.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>28 (4), 454-460</Feld596><PubVol>28</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>454</StrtPage><EndPage>460</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Felcht M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Koenen W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Weiss C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Weina K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Geraud C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Faulhaber J" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>23458729</PMID><DOI>10.1111/jdv.12122</DOI><KST>G300</KST></row><row><publishedID>45790</publishedID><Artikel>The telomere profile distinguishes two classes of genetically distinct cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas</Artikel><Journal>Oncogene</Journal><ABSTr>The incidence of skin cancer is increasing worldwide and cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality, particularly in immunosuppressed individuals ('carcinomatous catastrophy'). Yet, molecular mechanisms are still insufficiently understood. Besides ultraviolet (UV)-indicative mutations, chromosomal aberrations are prominent. As telomeres are essential in preserving chromosome integrity, and telomere erosion as well as aberrant spatial telomere distribution contribute to genomic instability, we first established telomere length profiles across the whole tissue and identified normal skin (10/30) harboring discrete epidermal sites (stem cell territories) of evenly short telomeres. Precancerous actinic keratoses (AKs) (17) and SCCs (27) expressed two telomere phenotypes: (i) tissue-wide evenly short to intermediate and (ii) longer and tissue-wide heterogeneous telomere lengths, suggesting two modes of initiation, with one likely to originate in the epidermal stem cells. Although tumor histotype, location, patient gender or age failed to distinguish the two SCC telomere phenotypes, as did telomerase activity, we found a trend for a higher degree of aberrant p53 and cyclin D1 expression with long/heterogeneous telomeres. In addition, we established an association for the short/homogeneous telomeres with a simpler and the heterogeneous telomeres with a more complex karyotype correlating also with distinct chromosomal changes. SCCs (13) from renal transplant recipients displayed the same telomere dichotomy, suggesting that both telomere subtypes contribute to 'carcinomatous catastrophy' under immunosuppression by selecting for a common set (3, 9p and 17q) and subtype-specific aberrations (e.g., 6p gain, 13q loss). As a second mechanism of telomere-dependent genomic instability, we investigated changes in telomere distribution with its most severe form of telomeric aggregates (TAs). We identified a telomere length-independent but progression-dependent increase in cells with small telomere associations in AKs (17/17) and additional TAs in SCCs (24/32), basal cell carcinomas (30/31) and malignant melanomas (15/15), and provide evidence for a reactive oxygen species-dependent mechanism in this UV-induced telomere organization-dependent genomic instability.Oncogene advance online publication, 19 August 2013; doi:10.1038/onc.2013.323.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>33 (27), 3506-3518</Feld596><PubVol>33</PubVol><PubIss>27</PubIss><StrtPage>3506</StrtPage><EndPage>3518</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Leufke C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Leykauf J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Krunic D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Jauch A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Holtgreve-Grez H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Boehm-Steuer B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Broecker EB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Mauch C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Utikal J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Hartschuh W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Purdie KJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Boukamp P" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>23955078</PMID><DOI>10.1038/onc.2013.323</DOI><KST>A110</KST><KST>G300</KST><KEYWORD>HTERT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>P53 MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOMIC INSTABILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NONMELANOMA SKIN-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSPLANTATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LOCALIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-SITU HYBRIDIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTINIC KERATOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BASAL</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>45795</publishedID><Artikel>Cellular and molecular pathways in the tumor immunoenvironment: 3rd Cancer Immunotherapy and Immunomonitoring (CITIM) meeting, 22-25 April 2013, Krakow, Poland</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Immunology Immunotherapy</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>63 (1), 73-80</Feld596><PubVol>63</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>73</StrtPage><EndPage>80</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Shurin MR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Umansky V" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Malyguine A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Hurwitz AA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Apte RN" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Whiteside T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Jewett A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Thanavala Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Murphy WJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24271210</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00262-013-1501-z</DOI><KST>G300</KST></row><row><publishedID>45796</publishedID><Artikel>Neo-adjuvant imatinib in advanced primary or locally recurrent dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans: a multicenter phase-II DeCOG trial with long-term follow-up</Artikel><Journal>Clinical Cancer Research</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a rare cutaneous tumor. COL1A1-PDGFB gene fusion is frequent in DFSP, rendering tumor cell proliferation and survival dependent on PDGFRB signaling. This trial investigated imatinib as neo-adjuvant treatment of DFSP including long-term follow-up. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The primary endpoint of this multicenter phase-II trial was response; secondary endpoints were safety, tumor relapse, and response biomarkers. Patients with advanced primary or locally recurrent DFSP and measurable disease by RECIST were eligible and received imatinib 600 mg/d until definitive surgery with histopathological proof of tumor-free margins. RESULTS: 16 patients received imatinib; 14 patients were evaluable for all endpoints. Median treatment duration was 3.1 months; median tumor shrinkage was 31.5%. Best overall response was 7.1% CR, 50.0% PR, 35.7% SD, and 7.1% PD. Toxicity was moderate with 25.0% grade 3-4 events. During a median follow-up of 6.4 years, one patient developed secondary resistance to imatinib but responded to second-line sunitinib. This patient also presented local recurrence, distant metastasis and death from DFSP. Exploratory analysis showed that response to imatinib was associated with decreased tumor cellularity and formation of strong hyalinic fibrosis. Weak PDGFRB phosphorylation and pigmented-type DFSP were associated with non-response. Additional to PDGFRB, the kinases EGFR and insulin receptor were found activated in a high percentage of DFSPs. CONCLUSION: The neo-adjuvant use of imatinib 600 mg/d in DFSP is efficacious and well-tolerated. Long-term follow-up results do not definitely support smaller surgical margins after successful imatinib pre-treatment, and presume that secondary resistance to imatinib might promote accelerated disease progression.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>20 (2), 499-510</Feld596><PubVol>20</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>499</StrtPage><EndPage>510</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ugurel S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Mentzel T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Utikal J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Helmbold P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Mohr P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Pfohler C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Schiller M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Hauschild A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Hein R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Kampgen E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Kellner I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Leverkus M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Becker JC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Strobel P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Schadendorf D" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24173542</PMID><DOI>10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-1411</DOI><KST>G300</KST><KEYWORD>FUSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MESYLATE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH-FACTOR-B</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>45814</publishedID><Artikel>Dual-Color Fluorescence Cross-Correlation Spectroscopy on a Single Plane Illumination Microscope (SPIM-FCCS)</Artikel><Journal>Optics Express</Journal><ABSTr>Single plane illumination microscopy based fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (SPIM-FCS) is a new method for imaging FCS in 3D samples, providing diffusion coefficients, flow velocities and concentrations in an imaging mode.

Previously, we could show that full-length L1CAM promotes metastasis formation via up-regulation of gelatinolytic activity in fibrosarcoma. In this study, we aimed to extend this finding to haematogenous malignancies and carcinomas, and to specifically elucidate the impact of L1CAM on major steps of the metastatic cascade. In a well-established T-cell lymphoma spontaneous metastasis model, silencing of L1CAM significantly improved survival of the mice, while intradermal tumour growth remained unaltered. This correlated with significantly decreased spontaneous metastasis formation. L1CAM suppression abrogated the metastatic potential of T-cell lymphoma as well as carcinoma cells as demonstrated by reduced migration and invasion in vitro and reduced formation of experimental metastasis in vivo. At the molecular level, silencing of L1CAM led to reduced expression of gelatinases MMP-2 and -9 in vitro and decreased gelatinolytic activity in primary tumours and metastases in vivo. In accordance, knock down of L1CAM had similar suppressive effects on migration, invasion and in vivo-gelatinolytic activity as treatment with the specific gelatinase inhibitor SB-3CT. This newly discovered impact of L1CAM on distinct steps of the metastatic cascade and MMP activity highlights the potential of possible L1CAM-directed therapies to inhibit metastatic spread.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>31 (1), 87-100</Feld596><PubVol>31</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>87</StrtPage><EndPage>100</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Weinspach D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Seubert B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Schaten S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Honert K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Sebens S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Altevogt P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Krueger A" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24002299</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s10585-013-9613-6</DOI><KST>D015</KST><KEYWORD>RETROVIRAL VECTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MIGRATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INVASION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HIGH-TITER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR-METASTASIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OVARIAN-CARCINOMA CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>therapeutic antibodies</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>45930</publishedID><Artikel>Successful treatment of discoid lupus erythematosus with fumaric acid esters</Artikel><Journal>Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>71 (1), e15-e17</Feld596><PubVol>71</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>e15</StrtPage><EndPage>e17</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Tsianakas A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Herzog S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Landmann A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Patsinakidis N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Perusquía Ortiz AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Bonsmann G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Luger TA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Kuhn A."

Due to the clinical evidence demonstrating a clear relationship between ultraviolet (UV) light exposure and skin lesions of LE, photosensitivity has been proven to be an important factor in the pathogenesis of the disease. Standardised photoprovocation with UVA and UVB irradiation has been shown to be a reliable model for evaluating photosensitivity in patients with cutaneous LE (CLE) and analysing the underlying medical conditions of the disease. In this respect, UV irradiation can cause aberrant induction of apoptosis in keratinocytes and contribute to the appearance of excessive apoptotic cells in the skin of CLE patients. Moreover, apoptotic cells that cannot be cleared by phagocytes may undergo secondary necrosis and release proinflammatory compounds and potential autoantigens, which may contribute to the inflammatory micromilieu that leads to formation of skin lesions in the disease. In addition to UV-mediated induction of apoptosis, the molecular and cellular factors that may cause the abnormal long-lasting photoreactivity in CLE include mediators of inflammation, such as cytokines and chemokines. In particular, interferons (IFNs) are important players in the early activation of the immune system and have a specific role in the immunological interface between the innate and the adaptive immune system. The fact that treatment with recombinant type I IFNs (alpha and beta) can induce not only systemic organ manifestations but also LE-like skin lesions provides additional evidence for a pathogenetic role of these IFNs in the disease.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>47 (2), 148-162</Feld596><PubVol>47</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>148</StrtPage><EndPage>162</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kuhn A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Wenzel J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Weyd H."

To investigate the primary source of ROS in liver cells, we used tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) as stimulus. Applying inhibitors against the respiratory chain complexes, we identified mitochondria as primary source of ROS production. TNF-alpha altered mitochondrial integrity by mimicking a mild uncoupling effect in liver cells, as indicated by a 40% reduction in membrane potential and ATP depletion (35%). TNF-alpha-induced ROS production activated NF-kappa B 3.5-fold and subsequently enhanced migration up to 12.7-fold. This study identifies complex I and complex III of the mitochondrial respiratory chain as point of release of ROS upon TNF-alpha stimulation of liver cells, which enhances cell migration by activating NF-kappa B signalling.

To identify new markers for CRC we scrutinized the methylation status of 231 DNA repair-related genes by methyl-CpG immunoprecipitation followed by global methylation profiling on a CpG island microarray, as altered expression of these genes could drive genomic and chromosomal instability observed in these tumors. We show for the first time hypermethylation of MMP9, DNMT3A and LIG4 in CRC which was confirmed in two CRC patient groups with different ethnicity. DNA ligase IV (LIG4) showed strong differential promoter methylation (up to 60) which coincided with downregulation of mRNA in 51 of cases. This functional association of LIG4 methylation and gene expression was supported by LIG4 re-expression in 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine-treated colon cancer cell lines, and reduced ligase IV amounts and end-joining activity in extracts of tumors with hypermethylation. Methylation of LIG4 was not associated with other genetic and epigenetic markers of CRC in our study. As LIG4 is located on chromosome 13 which is frequently amplified in CRC, two loci were tested for gene amplification in a subset of 47 cases. Comparison of amplification, methylation and expression data revealed that, in 30 of samples, the LIG4 gene was amplified and methylated, but expression was not changed. In conclusion, hypermethylation of the LIG4 promoter is a new mechanism to control ligase IV expression. It may represent a new epigenetic marker for CRC independent of known markers.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (8), 2043-2054</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>2043</StrtPage><EndPage>2054</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kuhmann,C."

So far, clinical approaches that aim to specifically reduce chemotherapy-mediated toxicities are rare. Recently, a number of studies have demonstrated that herbal extracts derived from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) may reduce chemotherapy-induced side effects. Thus, we screened a panel of published cancer-inhibiting TCM compounds for their chemoprotective potential and identified the phytochemical Rocaglamide (Roc-A) as a candidate. We show that Roc-A significantly reduces apoptotic cell death induced by DNA-damaging anticancer drugs in primary human and murine cells. Investigation of the molecular mechanism of Roc-A-mediated protection revealed that Roc-A specifically blocks DNA damage-induced upregulation of the transcription factor p53 by inhibiting its protein synthesis. The essential role of p53 in Roc-A-mediated protection was confirmed by siRNA knockdown of p53 and by comparison of the effects of Roc-A on chemoprotection of splenocytes isolated from wild-type and p53-deficient mice. Importantly, Roc-A did not protect p53-deficient or -mutated cancer cells. Our data suggest that Roc-A may be used as an adjuvant to reduce the side effects of chemotherapy in patients with p53-deficient or -mutated tumors.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>5 (), e1000-</Feld596><PubVol>5</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>e1000</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Becker,M."

Recent reports suggest a possible role of extracellular (MUC1N) and transmembrane (MUC1C) subunits of Mucin 1 (MUC1) in pathogenesis of multiple myeloma (MM). Nuclear translocation of MUC1C is involved in activation of various oncogenic signalling pathways and both MUC1 subunits are potential therapeutic target. We aimed at performing a comprehensive expression analysis of the MUC1 subunits in plasma cell dyscrasias.

METHODS AND RESULTS: 

Immunohistochemistry with monoclonal antibodies against MUC1N (EMA and 5E10), tumour associated-glycoforms of MUC1N (5E5) and MUC1C subunit were applied on a series of biopsies from normal controls (n=10) and plasma cell dyscrasias (n=121). Clonal plasma cells showed reduced MUC1N expression, and the 5E5 MUC1N epitope was only expressed in neoplastic plasma cells. Nuclear localization of MUC1C was equally frequent in all diseases stages and did not differ from the control cases. Loss of both MUC1 subunits in MM (n=12) was associated with significantly shorter overall survival and was more frequent in pre-treated MM samples.

CONCLUSIONS: 

Our findings indicate that aberrant glycosylation of MUC1 is an early event in the pathogenesis of MM. In contrast, MUC1C nuclear localization is not likely to be a driver of tumour progression.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>64 (6), 799-806</Feld596><PubVol>64</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>799</StrtPage><EndPage>806</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Andrulis M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Ellert E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Mandel U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Clausen H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Lehners N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Raab MS" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Goldschmidt H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Schwartz-Albiez R" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24251368</PMID><DOI>10.1111/his.12330</DOI><KST>G330</KST><KST>D015</KST><KST>G170</KST><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>transcription</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INHIBITION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IDENTIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CARCINOMAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Multiples Myelom</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUC1-C ONCOPROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHAPERONE COSMC</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLYCOFORMS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>46109</publishedID><Artikel>Ultra-fast optimization for beam angle selection algorithms</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Physics / Conference Series</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>489 (), Art.

Leukemia Research 38 (4), 516-516, 2014.</Artikel><Journal>Leukemia Research</Journal><ABSTr>While most patients with early-stage cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) have a very good prognosis, the survival of patients with extensive tumour stage and visceral involvement remains extremely poor and necessitates the development of more effective treatment modalities. In this study, we evaluated the in vitro effects of two alkylphosphocholines (APCs, miltefosine and erufosine) and the polyphenolic compound curcumin on 5 human CTCL cell lines (Hut-78, HH, MJ, My-La CD4(+) and My-La CD8(+)). All tested drugs showed considerable cytotoxic activity, as determined by the MU dye reduction assay. The IC50 values of both APCs ranged from the low micromolar level (Hut-78 cells) to 60-80 mu M (HH cells). The IC50 values of curcumin ranged from 12 to 24 mu M. All tested drugs induced apoptosis, as ascertained by morphological changes, DNA fragmentation and activation of caspase cascades. Miltefosine and erufosine induced dephosphorylation of Akt in My-La CD8(+) cells and phosphorylation of JNK in Hut-78 and My-La CD8(+) cells. APCs increased the level of the autophagic marker LC3B in Hut-78 and MJ cells. Results from co-treatment with autophagy modulators suggested that the cytotoxicity of APCs in CTCL cells is mediated, at least in part, by induction of autophagy.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>38 (1), 49-56</Feld596><PubVol>38</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>49</StrtPage><EndPage>56</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Yosifov, D.Y."

Hence, a reasonable focus of diagnostics on its essential targets seems appropriate.

Particularly important is the identification of all patients who can be assigned to subgroups with a favorable prognosis and who might benefit from a specific therapy. For all other patients, platinum-based combination therapy is the standard cytostatic therapy.

In addition to platinum derivatives, taxanes, gemcitabine and irinotecan can also be used. Promising innovative approaches include targeted therapies, in particular bevacizumab and erlotinib, and identification of the tissue origin with micro-RNA or gene expression analyses which can help identify the most suitable organ-specific therapy for individual patients.

It would be desirable if the group of patients treated with unspecific therapy could be reduced by improved diagnostics so that these patients could be treated with organ-specific therapy or with molecularly targeted approaches. Micro-RNA and gene expression analyses appear to be interesting for this purpose. Another complementary approach is to improve the treatment results of patients receiving an unspecific standard combination therapy by additional administration of new targeted substances.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>54 (2), 112-116</Feld596><PubVol>54</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>112</StrtPage><EndPage>116</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Loeffler, H."

and Correction: WOS:000346177500027 ( LEUKEMIA, Volume: 28, Issue: 12, pages: 2427-2427, DOI: 10.1038/leu.2014.304</Artikel><Journal>Leukemia</Journal><ABSTr>The MIR-15A/-16-1 tumor suppressor microRNAs (miRNAs) are deleted in leukemic cells from more than 50% of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). As these miRNAs are also less abundant in patients without genomic deletion, their downregulation in CLL is likely to be caused by additional mechanisms. We found the primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) of MIR-15a/-16/-15b to be elevated and processing intermediates (precursor miRNAs) to be reduced in cells from CLL patients (22/38) compared with non-malignant B-cells (n=14), indicating a block of miRNA maturation at the DROSHA processing step. Using a luciferase reporter assay for pri-miR processing we validated the defect in primary CLL cells. The block of miRNA maturation is restricted to specific miRNAs and can be found in the cell line MEC-2, but not in MEC-1, even though both are derived from the same CLL patient. In these cells, the RNA-specific deaminase ADARB1 leads to reduced pri-miRNA processing, but full processing efficiency is recovered upon deletion of the RNA-binding domains or nuclear localization of ADARB1. Thus, we show that, apart from genomic deletion or transcriptional downregulation, aberrant processing of miRNA leads to specific reduction of miRNAs in leukemic cells. This represents a novel oncogenic mechanism in the pathogenesis of CLL.Leukemia advance online publication, 24 September 2013; doi:10.1038/leu.2013.246.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>28 (1), 98-107</Feld596><PubVol>28</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>98</StrtPage><EndPage>107</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Allegra D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Bilan V" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Garding A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Doehner H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Stilgenbauer S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Kuchenbauer F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Mertens D" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>23974981</PMID><DOI>10.1038/leu.2013.246</DOI><KST>B061</KST><KEYWORD>B-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>13Q14</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CLL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOMIC ABERRATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MANTLE CELL LYMPHOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MicroRNAs</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FREQUENT DELETIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>46235</publishedID><Artikel>Protection against RNA-induced liver damage by myeloid cells requires type I interferon and IL-1 receptor antagonist in mice</Artikel><Journal>Hepatology</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>59 (4), 1555-1563</Feld596><PubVol>59</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>1555</StrtPage><EndPage>1563</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Conrad, E*" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Resch, TK*" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Gogesch, P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kalinke, U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Bechmann, I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Bogdan, C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Waibler, Z" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="(*Both authors contributed equally)" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24677196</PMID><DOI>10.1002/hep.26915</DOI><KST>B200</KST></row><row><publishedID>46237</publishedID><Artikel>In vivo processing assay based on a dual-luciferase reporter system to evaluate DROSHA enzymatic activity</Artikel><Journal>Methods in Molecular Biology</Journal><ABSTr>Luciferase reporter assays are widely used to study promoter activity, transcription factors, intracellular signaling, protein interactions (Jia et al., PloS One 6:e26414), miRNA processing (Allegra and Mertens, Biochem Biophys Res Commun 406:501-505), and target recognition (Jin et al., Methods Mol Biol 936:117-127).

We have recently published the general effectiveness of an exercise intervention in 105 allo-HCT patients on physical performance and psychosocial well- being. However, predictor variables for differentiated treatment response remained unclear. To determine the impact of basic physical performance on treatment response, we assessed muscle strength and endurance performance at four assessment points before and after allo-HCT. The exercise group started training 2 weeks before admission and ended 6-8 weeks after discharge. Comparing initially fit with unfit classified patients, the fit patients lost 31% of the strength of the knee-extensors, whereas the unfit patients lost only 1% (P&lt;0.05). For endurance capacity, fit patients lost 4% of their walking capability, whereas unfit patients gained 13% (P&lt;0.05). The individual percent change was statistically different at the 0.05 level in all measures of physical performance. Individual training response in allo-HCT patients strongly depends on the initial physical performance level. Unfit patients can be trained safely and may benefit more from this exercise intervention than fit patients. This result is of major clinical relevance and should encourage hematologists to promote exercise even more in impaired/unfit allo-HCT patients.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>49 (3), 443-448</Feld596><PubVol>49</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>443</StrtPage><EndPage>448</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Wiskemann J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Kuehl R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Dreger P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schwerdtfeger R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Huber G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Ulrich CM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Jaeger D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Bohus, M."

The movement of ribosomes along open reading frames is non-uniformous and includes pausing sites, which facilitates nascent chain folding and perhaps factor engagement.

Besides surgical resection and irradiation of the locoregional tumor setting, central therapeutic aim is the elimination of disseminated micrometastatic tumor cells using cytostatic and/or hormonal treatment. Nevertheless, in the course of time a majority of patients suffer from systemic recurrence in the form of distant metastases. Intriguingly, in this connection, intratumoral cytotoxic T lymphocytes might serve as independent predictors of treatment efficacy and clinical outcome. Loss of immune balance (tumor dormancy) during intensive cross talk between T cells and tumor cells in the bone marrow microenvironment is suggested one reason for distant metastatic relapse. In this clinical context, further supportive therapies become increasingly attractive, taking immunological features of breast cancer cells into special account. The present review aims to dissect bone marrow-derived cellular antitumor immune responses and translational immunologic treatment options regarding their actual relevance to patients' clinical benefit and their future directions in breast cancer management.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>33 (1), 309-320</Feld596><PubVol>33</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>309</StrtPage><EndPage>320</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Stefanovic S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Schuetz S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Sohn C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Beckhove P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Domschke C" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24337953</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s10555-013-9452-6</DOI><KST>D015</KST><KEYWORD>CLINICAL-RESPONSES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EFFECTOR FUNCTIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BONE-MARROW MICROENVIRONMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REGULATORY T-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMMUNE-RESPONSES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANTITUMOR IMMUNITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MELANOMA PATIENTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PREDICT RESPONSE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMMUNOLOGICAL ASPECTS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>46308</publishedID><Artikel>Correlations of noninvasive BOLD and TOLD MRI with pO2 and relevance to tumor radiation response</Artikel><Journal>Magnetic Resonance in Medicine</Journal><ABSTr>Purpose: To examine the potential use of blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) and tissue oxygenation level dependent (TOLD) contrast MRI to assess tumor oxygenation and predict radiation response.

Methods: BOLD and TOLD MRI were performed on Dunning R3327-AT1 rat prostate tumors during hyperoxic gas breathing challenge at 4.7 T. Animals were divided into two groups. In Group 1 (n = 9), subsequent F-19 MRI based on spin lattice relaxation of hexafluorobenzene reporter molecule provided quantitative oximetry for comparison. For Group 2 rats (n = 13) growth delay following a single dose of 30 Gy was compared with preirradiation BOLD and TOLD assessments.

Results: Oxygen (100%O-2) and carbogen (95%O-2/5%CO2) challenge elicited similar BOLD, TOLD and pO(2) responses. Strong correlations were observed between BOLD or R-2(*) response and quantitative F-19 pO(2) measurements. TOLD response showed a general trend with weaker correlation. Irradiation caused a significant tumor growth delay and tumors with larger changes in TOLD and R-1 values upon oxygen breathing exhibited significantly increased tumor growth delay.

Conclusion: These results provide further insight into the relationships between oxygen sensitive (BOLD/TOLD) MRI and tumor pO(2). Moreover, a larger increase in R-1 response to hyperoxic gas challenge coincided with greater tumor growth delay following irradiation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>71 (5), 1863-1873</Feld596><PubVol>71</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>1863</StrtPage><EndPage>1873</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hallac,R.R."

Theory and MethodsThe proposed approach for oxygen partial pressure (pO(2)) estimation is based on intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion MRI and the dependence of the blood R-2 relaxation rate on the inter-echo spacing measured using a multiple spin-echo Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill sequence and weak-field diffusion model. The accuracy of the approach was validated by comparison with F-19 MRI oximetry.

ResultsThe results in eight rats at 4.7 T showed that tumors have longer T-1 (1980186 ms) and T-2 (59 +/- 9 ms) relaxation times, heterogeneous blood volume fraction (0.23 +/- 0.1), oxygen saturation level (Y) (0.53 +/- 0.12), and pO(2) (36 +/- 15 mmHg) distributions compared with normal muscle (T-1 1480 +/- 86 ms, T-2 29 +/- 2 ms, blood volume fraction 0.22 +/- 0.03, Y 0.49 +/- 0.06, and pO(2) 39 +/- 5 mmHg). pO(2) estimates based on the novel H-1 approach were essentially identical with F-19 observations.

ConclusionThe study indicates that noninvasive measurement of tumor pO(2) using H-1 MRI derived multiparametric maps is feasible and could become a valuable tool to evaluate tumor hypoxia.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>71 (2), 561-569</Feld596><PubVol>71</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>561</StrtPage><EndPage>569</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Zhang,Z."

Materials and

Methods: Four MR sites with a 7-T MR system and 2 MR sites with a 9.4-T MR system participated in this multicenter study with a total number of 3457 completed questionnaires on causes of discomfort and sensations during the examination. For a pooled retrospective analysis of the results from the partially different questionnaires, all data were adapted to an answer option with a 4-point scale (0 = no discomfort/side effect, 3 = very unpleasant/very strong sensation). To differentiate effects evoked by the low-frequency time-varying magnetic fields due to movement through the static magnetic field, most questionnaires separated the manifestation of sensory side effects during movement on the patient table from manifestation while lying still in the isocenter.

Results: In general, a high acceptance of UHF examinations was found, where in 82% of the completed questionnaires, the subjects stated the examination to be at least tolerable. Although in 7.6% of the questionnaires, subjects felt discomfort during the examination, only 0.9% of the image acquisitions had to be terminated prematurely. No adverse events occurred in any of the examinations. Only 1% of the subjects were unwilling to undergo further UHF MRI examinations. Examination duration was the most complained cause of discomfort, followed by acoustic noise and lying still. All magnetic-field-related sensations were more pronounced when moving the patient table versus the isocenter position (19%/2% of the subjects felt unpleasant vertigo during the moving/stationary state). In general, vertigo was the most often stated sensory side effect and was more pronounced at 9.4 T compared with 7 T. However, the results varied substantially among the different sites.

Conclusions: The high levels of subjective acceptance found in this study lead to the conclusion that UHF MRI would be tolerated as a diagnostic tool in clinical practice. For more consistent data ascertainment, we propose a standardized questionnaire for subjective perception monitoring.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>49 (5), 249-259</Feld596><PubVol>49</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>249</StrtPage><EndPage>259</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Rauschenberg, J."

Hence, to identify new molecular alterations that allow for identification of patients unlikely to respond to AZA could impact the utility of this therapy. We determined the expression levels of genes involved in AZA metabolism: UCK1, UCK2, DCK, hENT1, RRM1 and RRM2 using quantitative PCR in samples from 57 patients with MDS who received AZA. Lower expression of UCK1 was seen in patients without a response to AZA (median 0.2 vs 0.49 for patients with response to AZA, P = 0.07). This difference in UCK1 expression was not influenced by aberrant methylation of the UCK1 promoter. In addition, the seven polymorphic loci found in the coding sequence were not associated with UCK1 gene expression nor AZA response. Silencing of UCK1 by siRNA leads to blunted response to AZA in vitro. The univariate analysis revealed that patients expressing lower than median levels of UCK1 had a shorter overall survival (P = 0.049). Our results suggest that expression level of UCK1 is correlated with clinical outcome and may influence the clinical response to AZA treatment in patients with MDS.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>28 (3), 621-628</Feld596><PubVol>28</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>621</StrtPage><EndPage>628</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Valencia A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Masala E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Rossi A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Martino A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Sanna A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Buchi F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Canzian F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Cilloni D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Gaidano V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Voso MT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Kosmider O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Fontenay M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Gozzini A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Bosi A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Santini V."

PID1 was first identified in 2006 as a gene that modulates insulin signaling and mitochondrial function in adipocytes and muscle cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Quantitative RT-PCR, microarrays and cell culture RESULTS: Using four independent medulloblastoma datasets, we show that mean PID1 mRNA levels were lower in unfavorable medulloblastomas (Groups 3 and 4, and anaplastic histology) compared with favorable medulloblastomas (SHH and WNT groups, and desmoplastic/nodular histology) and with fetal cerebellum. In two large independent glioma datasets PID1 mRNA was lower in glioblastomas (GBMs), the most malignant gliomas, compared to other astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas and non-tumor brains. Neural and proneural GBM subtypes had higher PID1 mRNA compared to classical and mesenchymal GBM. Importantly, overall survival and radiation-free progression-free survival were longer in medulloblastoma patients with higher PID1 mRNA (univariate and multivariate analyses). Higher PID1 mRNA also correlated with longer overall survival in glioma and GBM patients. In cell culture, overexpression of PID1 inhibited colony formation in medulloblastoma, atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT) and GBM cell lines. Increasing PID1 also increased cell death and apoptosis, inhibited proliferation, induced mitochondrial depolarization, and decreased serum-mediated phosphorylation of AKT and ERK in medulloblastoma, ATRT and/or GBM cell lines, whereas siRNA to PID1 diminished mitochondrial depolarization. CONCLUSIONS: These data are the first to link PID1 to cancer and suggest that PID1 may have a tumor inhibitory function in these pediatric and adult brain tumors.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>20 (4), 827-836</Feld596><PubVol>20</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>827</StrtPage><EndPage>836</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Erdreich-Epstein A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Robison N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Ren X" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Zhou H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Xu J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Davidson TB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Schur M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Gilles FH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Ji L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Malvar J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Shackleford GM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Margol A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Krieger MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Judkins AR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Jones DT" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Pfister SM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="16" name="Kool M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="17" name="Sposto R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Asgharzadeh S" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24300787</PMID><DOI>10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-2053</DOI><KST>B062</KST><KEYWORD>MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FACTOR-I</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>proliferation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>medulloblastoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>3T3-L1 ADIPOCYTES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INSULIN-RESISTANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RHABDOID TUMORS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>46563</publishedID><Artikel>Robustness of DNA repair through collective rate control</Artikel><Journal>PloS Computational Biology</Journal><ABSTr>DNA repair and other chromatin-associated processes are carried out by enzymatic macromolecular complexes that assemble at specific sites on the chromatin fiber. How the rate of these molecular machineries is regulated by their constituent parts is poorly understood. Here we quantify nucleotide-excision DNA repair in mammalian cells and find that, despite the pathways' molecular complexity, repair effectively obeys slow first-order kinetics. Theoretical analysis and data-based modeling indicate that these kinetics are not due to a singular rate-limiting step. Rather, first-order kinetics emerge from the interplay of rapidly and reversibly assembling repair proteins, stochastically distributing DNA lesion repair over a broad time period. Based on this mechanism, the model predicts that the repair proteins collectively control the repair rate. Exploiting natural cell-to-cell variability, we corroborate this prediction for the lesion-recognition factor XPC and the downstream factor XPA. Our findings provide a rationale for the emergence of slow time scales in chromatin-associated processes from fast molecular steps and suggest that collective rate control might be a widespread mode of robust regulation in DNA repair and transcription.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>10 (1), e1003438-</Feld596><PubVol>10</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>e1003438</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Verbruggen, P.#" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Heinemann, T.#" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Manders, E."

Current medulloblastoma protocols stratify patients based on clinical features: patient age, metastatic stage, extent of resection, and histologic variant. Stark prognostic and genetic differences among the four subgroups suggest that subgroup-specific molecular biomarkers could improve patient prognostication.

Patients and Methods Molecular biomarkers were identified from a discovery set of 673 medulloblastomas from 43 cities around the world. Combined risk stratification models were designed based on clinical and cytogenetic biomarkers identified by multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses. Identified biomarkers were tested using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) on a nonoverlapping medulloblastoma tissue microarray (n = 453), with subsequent validation of the risk stratification models.

Results Subgroup information improves the predictive accuracy of a multivariable survival model compared with clinical biomarkers alone. Most previously published cytogenetic biomarkers are only prognostic within a single medulloblastoma subgroup. Profiling six FISH biomarkers (GLI2, MYC, chromosome 11 [chr11], chr14, 17p, and 17q) on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues, we can reliably and reproducibly identify very low-risk and very high-risk patients within SHH, Group 3, and Group 4 medulloblastomas.

Conclusion Combining subgroup and cytogenetic biomarkers with established clinical biomarkers substantially improves patient prognostication, even in the context of heterogeneous clinical therapies. The prognostic significance of most molecular biomarkers is restricted to a specific subgroup. We have identified a small panel of cytogenetic biomarkers that reliably identifies very high-risk and very low-risk groups of patients, making it an excellent tool for selecting patients for therapy intensification and therapy de-escalation in future clinical trials.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>32 (9),

Despite the proven albeit modest benefits of gemcitabine demonstrated over a decade ago, subsequent advances have been slow, suggesting it may be time to take a different approach. It is thought that some key characteristics of pancreatic cancer, such as the desmoplasia, restricted vasculature and hypoxic environment, may prevent the delivery of chemotherapy to the tumour thereby explaining the limited benefits observed to-date. Moreover, there is evidence to suggest that the stroma is not only a mechanical barrier but also constitutes a dynamic compartment of pancreatic tumours that is critically involved in tumour formation, progression and metastasis. Thus, targeting the stroma and the tumour represents a promising therapeutic strategy. Currently, several stroma-targeting agents are entering clinical development. Among these, nab-paclitaxel appears promising since it combines cytotoxic therapy with targeted delivery via its proposed ability to bind SPARC on tumour and stromal cells. Preclinical data indicate that co-treatment with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine results in stromal depletion, increased tumour vascularization and intratumoural gemcitabine concentration, and increased tumour regression compared with either agent alone. Phase I/II study data also suggest that a high level of antitumor activity can be achieved with this combination in pancreatic cancer. This was recently confirmed in a Phase III study which showed that nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine significantly improved overall survival (HR 0.72) and progression-free survival (HR 0.69) versus gemcitabine alone for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>40 (1), 118-128</Feld596><PubVol>40</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>118</StrtPage><EndPage>128</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Heinemann V" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Reni M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Ychou M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Richel DJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Macarulla T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Ducreux M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>23849556</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.ctrv.2013.04.004</DOI><KST>L701</KST><KEYWORD>stroma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>stellate cells</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Nab-paclitaxel</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>stem cells</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GEMCITABINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>extracellular matrix</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SPARC</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>pancreatic cancer</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SONIC HEDGEHOG</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>46741</publishedID><Artikel>Deciphering the systems biology of mTOR inhibition by integrative transcriptome analysis</Artikel><Journal>Current Pharmaceutical Design</Journal><ABSTr>The mTOR signaling plays an integral role in cellular homeostasis controlling the transition between the catabolic and anabolic states. Originally approved as immunosuppressive agents preventing allograft rejection, inhibitors of mTOR signaling have recently entered the arena of cancer therapy. Using rapamycin derivative (RAD001) as a prototype inhibitor, we aimed to systematically analyze the molecular mechanisms underlying the pleiotropic effects of mTOR signaling. Using proliferation- and clonogenic survival assays, a preferential sensitivity of microvascular endothelial cells (HDMVEC) followed by fibroblasts and U87 gliblastoma to RAD001 treatment was found. In contrast, lung- and prostate tumor cells demonstrated relative resistance against RAD001 treatment. In co-culture with fibroblasts, RAD001 exerted potent antiangiogenic effects by inhibiting endothelial cell tube formation. Further, RAD001 treatment efficiently prevented tumor growth in U87 tumor xenografts. Integrative transcriptome analysis was performed to decipher the molecular mechanism underlying RAD001 -induced anti-tumor and antiangiogenic effects. The predominant expression pattern was downregulation of genes after RAD001 treatment in all three sensitive cell types. Among the RAD001 downregulated genes, a transcriptional network was discovered enriched for genes related to angiogenesis processes and extracellular matrix remodeling, e. g., VEGF, HIF1A, CXCLs, IL6, FN, PAI-1 or NRP1. Of note, key components of PI3K upstream (PDK1) as well as mTORC2 downstream signaling (SGK1, NDRG) were downregulated by RAD001. Decreased expression of IMPDH and 139 common gene targets between mycophenolic acid and RAD001 suggested in part shared mechanisms underlying their antiangiogenic and immunosuppressive effects. In summary, key genetic participants governing anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic effects of mTOR inhibition were identified.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>20 (1), 88-100</Feld596><PubVol>20</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>88</StrtPage><EndPage>100</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Domhan S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Schwager C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Wei Q" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Muschal S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Sommerer C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Morath C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Wick W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Maercker C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Debus J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Zeier M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Huber PE" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Abdollahi A."

Thus, continuous efforts have been undertaken to further characterize this subpopulation of less differentiated tumor cells. Although we are able to enrich GSCs, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of GSC phenotypes and behavior. The advent of high-throughput technologies raised hope that incorporation of these newly developed platforms would help to tackle such questions. Since then a couple of comparative genome-, transcriptome- and proteome-wide studies on GSCs have been conducted giving new insights in GSC biology. However, lessons had to be learned in designing high-throughput experiments and some of the resulting conclusions fell short of expectations because they were performed on only a few GSC lines or at one molecular level instead of an integrative poly-omics approach. Despite these shortcomings, our knowledge of GSC biology has markedly expanded due to a number of survival-associated biomarkers as well as glioma-relevant signaling pathways and therapeutic targets being identified. In this article we review recent findings obtained by comparative high-throughput analyses of GSCs. We further summarize fundamental concepts of systems biology as well as its applications for glioma stem cell research.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>20 (1), 66-72</Feld596><PubVol>20</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>66</StrtPage><EndPage>72</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Mock A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Chiblak S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Herold-Mende C."

The intention of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of PET/MRI with this tracer.

Twenty patients underwent PET/CT 1 h after injection of the Ga-68-PSMA ligand followed by PET/MRI 3 h after injection. Data from the two investigations were first analysed separately and then compared with respect to tumour detection rate and radiotracer uptake in various tissues. To evaluate the quantification accuracy of the PET/MRI system, differences in SUVs between PET/CT and corresponding PET/MRI were compared with differences in SUVs between PET/CT 1 h and 3 h after injection in another patient cohort. This cohort was investigated using the same PET/CT system.

With PET/MRI, different diagnostic sequences, higher contrast of lesions and higher resolution of MRI enabled a subjectively easier evaluation of the images. In addition, four unclear findings on PET/CT could be clarified as characteristic of PCa metastases by PET/MRI. However, in PET images of the PET/MRI, a reduced signal was observed at the level of the kidneys (in 11 patients) and around the urinary bladder (in 15 patients). This led to reduced SUVs in six lesions. SUVmean values provided by the PET/MRI system were different in muscles, blood pool, liver and spleen.

PCa was detected more easily and more accurately with Ga-PSMA PET/MRI than with PET/CT and with lower radiation exposure. Consequently, this new technique could clarify unclear findings on PET/CT. However, scatter correction was challenging when the specific Ga-68-PSMA ligand was used. Moreover, direct comparison of SUVs from PET/CT and PET/MR needs to be conducted carefully.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>41 (5), 887-897</Feld596><PubVol>41</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>887</StrtPage><EndPage>897</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Afshar-Oromieh,A."

We systematically investigate how changes in the concentration of monovalent potassium and divalent magnesium ions affect the internal organization of the resulting filaments. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is very sensitive to changes in the filament cross-section such as diameter or compactness. Our measurements reveal that filaments formed in the presence of magnesium chloride differ distinctly from filaments formed in the presence of potassium chloride. The principle multi-step assembly mechanism from tetramers via unit-length filaments (ULF) to elongated filaments is not changed by the valency of ions. However, the observed differences indicate that the magnesium ions free the head domains of tetramers from unproductive interactions to allow assembly but at the same time mediate strong inter-tetrameric interactions that impede longitudinal annealing of unit-length filaments considerably, thus slowing down filament growth.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>10 (12), 2059-2068</Feld596><PubVol>10</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>2059</StrtPage><EndPage>2068</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Brennich M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Bauch S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Vainio U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Wedig T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Herrmann H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Koester S" IsDKFZ="0"/><DOI>10.1039/c3sm52532e</DOI><KST>B065</KST><KEYWORD>PARAMAGNETIC-RESONANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSIENT ELECTRIC BIREFRINGENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTERMEDIATE-FILAMENT NETWORKS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SCAFFOLDS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ARCHITECTURE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>KINETICS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMPLEXES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MECHANISM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DOMAIN</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>46898</publishedID><Artikel>Evolution of DNA methylation is linked to genetic aberrations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Discovery</Journal><ABSTr>Although clonal selection by genetic driver aberrations in cancer is well documented, the ability of epigenetic alterations to promote tumor evolution is undefined. We used 450k arrays and next-generation sequencing to evaluate intra-tumor heterogeneity and evolution of DNA methylation and genetic aberrations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). CLL cases exhibit vast inter-patient differences in intra-tumor methylation heterogeneity, with genetically clonal cases maintaining low methylation heterogeneity and up to 10 percent of total CpGs in a monoallelically methylated state. Increasing methylation heterogeneity correlates with advanced genetic subclonal complexity. Selection of novel DNA methylation patterns is observed only in cases that undergo genetic evolution, and independent genetic evolution is uncommon and is restricted to low-risk alterations. These results reveal that although evolution of DNA methylation occurs in high-risk, clinically-progressive cases, positive selection of novel methylation patterns entail co-evolution of genetic alteration(s) in CLL.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>4 (3), 348-361</Feld596><PubVol>4</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>348</StrtPage><EndPage>361</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Oakes CC" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Claus R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Gu L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Assenov Y" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Huellein J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Zucknick M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Bieg M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Brocks D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Bogatyrova O" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Schmidt CR" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Rassenti L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Kipps TJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Mertens D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Lichter P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="14" name="Doehner H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Stilgenbauer S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Byrd JC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Zenz T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="18" name="Plass C" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24356097</PMID><DOI>10.1158/2159-8290.CD-13-0349</DOI><KST>B080</KST><KST>B060</KST><KST>C010</KST><KST>C060</KST><KST>G100</KST><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REVEALS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOMIC ABERRATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HYPOMETHYLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CLONAL EVOLUTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPIGENOME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEMATOPOIETIC STEM</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>46899</publishedID><Artikel>Embryonal tumor with abundant neuropil and true rosettes (ETANTR), ependymoblastoma, and medulloepithelioma share molecular similarity and comprise a single clinicopathological entity</Artikel><Journal>Acta Neuropathologica</Journal><ABSTr>Three histological variants are known within the family of embryonal rosette-forming neuroepithelial brain tumors. These include embryonal tumor with abundant neuropil and true rosettes (ETANTR), ependymoblastoma (EBL), and medulloepithelioma (MEPL). In this study, we performed a comprehensive clinical, pathological, and molecular analysis of 97 cases of these rare brain neoplasms, including genome-wide DNA methylation and copy number profiling of 41 tumors. We identified uniform molecular signatures in all tumors irrespective of histological patterns, indicating that ETANTR, EBL, and MEPL comprise a single biological entity. As such, future WHO classification schemes should consider lumping these variants into a single diagnostic category, such as embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes (ETMR). We recommend combined LIN28A immunohistochemistry and FISH analysis of the 19q13.42 locus for molecular diagnosis of this tumor category. Recognition of this distinct pediatric brain tumor entity based on the fact that the three histological variants are molecularly and clinically uniform will help to distinguish ETMR from other embryonal CNS tumors and to better understand the biology of these highly aggressive and therapy-resistant pediatric CNS malignancies, possibly leading to alternate treatment strategies.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>128 (2), 279-289</Feld596><PubVol>128</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>279</StrtPage><EndPage>289</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Korshunov A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Sturm D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Ryzhova M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Hovestadt V" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Gessi M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Jones DT" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Remke M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Northcott P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Perry A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Picard D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Rosenblum M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Antonelli M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Aronica E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Schuller U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Hasselblatt M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Woehrer A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Zheludkova O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Kumirova E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Puget S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Taylor MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Giangaspero F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Peter Collins V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="von Deimling A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="23" name="Lichter P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="24" name="Huang A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Pietsch T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Pfister SM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="27" name="Kool M" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24337497</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00401-013-1228-0</DOI><KST>B060</KST><KST>G380</KST><KST>B062</KST><KEYWORD>BRAIN-TUMORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OF-THE-LITERATURE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FEATURES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AMPLIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIFFERENTIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CASE-BASED UPDATE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>46909</publishedID><Artikel>Smoking, lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, and risk for colorectal cancer</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers and Prevention</Journal><ABSTr>Background: Lower gastrointestinal endoscopy can decrease colorectal cancer risk strongly through detection and removal of adenomas. Thus, we aimed to investigate whether utilization of lower gastrointestinal endoscopy modifies the effect of lifetime smoking exposure on colorectal cancer risk in a population-based case-control study.

Methods: In this study from Southern Germany including 2,916 patients with colorectal cancer and 3,044 controls, information about lifetime smoking and other risk factors was obtained from standardized interviews. Self-reported endoscopies were validated by medical records. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to investigate associations of smoking with colorectal cancer risk after stratification by utilization of lower gastrointestinal endoscopy in the preceding 10 years.

Results: Median age of patients and controls was 69 and 70 years, respectively. Former regular smoking was associated with increased colorectal cancer risk in the group with no previous endoscopy [adjusted OR, 1.50; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.28-1.75], whereas no association was found in the group with preceding endoscopy (OR, 1.05; CI, 0.83-1.33; P for interaction &lt;0.01). Lower gastrointestinal endoscopy did not modify the association of smoking and colorectal cancer risk among current smokers and among the more recent quitters.

Conclusions: Our results suggest that the increased risk of colorectal cancer among former regular smokers is essentially overcome by detection and removal of adenomas at lower gastrointestinal endoscopy. However, risk of colorectal cancer was increased if smoking was continued into higher adult age.

Impact: The strong protective effect of lower gastrointestinal endoscopy may be compromised by continued smoking. Smoking cessation may increase the efficacy of lower gastrointestinal endoscopy.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (3), 525-533</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>525</StrtPage><EndPage>533</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hoffmeister M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Jansen L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Stock C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Chang-Claude J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24403529</PMID><DOI>10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-13-0729-</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>POPULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEALTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CIGARETTE-SMOKING</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>microsatellite instability</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>colonoscopy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AVERAGE-RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SERVICES TASK-FORCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>pooled analysis</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FATTY-ACID SYNTHASE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>46911</publishedID><Artikel>BRAF V600E-specific immunohistochemistry reveals low mutation rates in biliary tract cancer and restriction to intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma</Artikel><Journal>Modern Pathology</Journal><ABSTr>BRAF mutations have emerged as an important predictive biomarker for metastasized melanoma. Other types of cancer may also benefit from BRAF mutation-targeted therapies. In biliary tract cancer, reported BRAF mutation rates are highly controversial, ranging from 0 to 33% in adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder and 0 to 22% in cholangiocarcinoma. We here analyzed tissue microarrays of a large cohort of biliary tract cancer (n=377) including 159 intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, 149 extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas, and 69 adenocarcinomas of the gallbladder for BRAF V600E mutation using a highly sensitive immunohistochemical screening approach implementing the BRAF V600E protein-specific antibody VE1. All VE1-positive cases as well as 42 VE1-negative cases were additionally analyzed by Sanger sequencing. In total, only 5 VE1-positive cases were detected (5/377; 1%). BRAF V600E mutation was confirmed by direct sequencing in all cases. All 5 mutated cases were intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (5/159; 3%). None of the extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas and adenocarcinomas of the gallbladder were VE1 positive. Apart from the subtype restriction of BRAF V600E mutation to intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and a female predominance (4 female, 1 male), no significant correlation with clinicopathological data and patient outcome was detected. In conclusion, we demonstrate that BRAF V600E mutation is a rare event in biliary tract cancer, accounting for only 1% of all subtypes, and is restricted to intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. In addition, we demonstrate that VE1 immunohistochemistry is a feasible approach to routinely screen for BRAF V600E mutation in biliary tract cancer patients, thereby facilitating the detection of rare patients who may benefit from BRAF mutation-targeted therapies.Modern Pathology advance online publication, 6 December 2013; doi:10.1038/modpathol.2013.206.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>27 (7), 1028-1034</Feld596><PubVol>27</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>1028</StrtPage><EndPage>1034</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Goeppert B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Frauenschuh L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Renner M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Roessler S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Stenzinger A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Klauschen F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Warth A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Vogel MN" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Mehrabi A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Hafezi M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Boehmer K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="von Deimling A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Schirmacher P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Weichert W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Capper D" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24309328</PMID><DOI>10.1038/modpathol.2013.206</DOI><KST>G380</KST><KEYWORD>DABRAFENIB</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PAPILLARY THYROID-CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OPEN-LABEL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Lynch syndrome</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>V600E mutation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BRAF(V600E) MUTATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VEMURAFENIB</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METASTATIC MELANOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRIAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MALIGNANT-MELANOMA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>46913</publishedID><Artikel>Relative risks of chronic kidney disease for mortality and end-stage renal disease across races are similar</Artikel><Journal>Kidney International</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>86 (4), 819-827</Feld596><PubVol>86</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>819</StrtPage><EndPage>827</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Wen CP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Matsushita K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Coresh J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Iseki K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Islam M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Katz R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="McClellan W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Peralta CA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Wang HY" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="de Zeeuw D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Astor BC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Gansevoort RT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Levey AS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Levin A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="and for the Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium*" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="*Authors on behalf of the ESTHER study: Rothenbacher D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="17" name="Müller H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Schoettker B" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24522492</PMID><DOI>10.1038/ki.2013.553</DOI><KST>C070</KST></row><row><publishedID>46916</publishedID><Artikel>Loss of FUBP1 expression in gliomas predicts FUBP1 mutation and is associated with oligodendroglial differentiation, IDH1 mutation and 1p/19q loss of heterozygosity</Artikel><Journal>Neuropathology and Applied Neurobiology</Journal><ABSTr>AIMS: The Far Upstream Element [FUSE] Binding Protein 1 (FUBP1) regulates target genes, such as the cell cycle regulators MYC and p21. FUBP1 is up-regulated in many tumours and acts as an oncoprotein by stimulating proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. Recently, FUBP1 mutations were identified in approximately 15% of oligodendrogliomas. To date, all reported FUBP1 mutations have been predicted to inactivate FUBP1, which suggests that in contrast to most other tumours FUBP1 may act as a tumour suppressor in oligodendrogliomas. METHODS: As no data are currently available concerning FUBP1 protein levels in gliomas, we examined the FUBP1 expression profiles of human glial tumours by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. We analysed FUBP1 expression related to morphological differentiation, IDH1 and FUBP1 mutation status, 1p/19q loss of heterozygosity (LOH) as well as proliferation rate. RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate that FUBP1 expression levels are increased in all glioma subtypes as compared to normal central nervous system (CNS) control tissue and are associated with increased proliferation. In contrast, FUBP1 immunonegativity predicted FUBP1 mutation with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 90% in our cohort and was associated with oligodendroglial differentiation, IDH1 mutation and 1p/19q loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Using this approach, we detected a to-date undescribed FUBP1 mutation in an oligodendroglioma. CONCLUSION: In summary, our data indicate an association between of FUBP1 expression and proliferation in gliomas. Furthermore, our findings present FUBP1 immunohistochemical analysis as a helpful additional tool for neuropathological glioma diagnostics predicting FUBP1 mutation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>40 (2), 205-216</Feld596><PubVol>40</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>205</StrtPage><EndPage>216</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Baumgarten P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Harter PN" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Toenjes M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Capper D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Blank AE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Sahm F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="von Deimling A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Kolluru V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Schwamb B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Rabenhorst U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Starzetz T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Kogel D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Rieker RJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Plate KH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Ohgaki H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Radlwimmer B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="16" name="Zornig M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Mittelbronn M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24117486</PMID><DOI>10.1111/nan.12088</DOI><KST>B060</KST><KST>G380</KST><KEYWORD>OVEREXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>C-MYC</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IDENTIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MECHANISM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>transcription</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>proliferation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FAR UPSTREAM ELEMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIFFUSE GLIOMAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BINDING PROTEIN-1</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>46922</publishedID><Artikel>A single-arm phase II Austrian/German multicenter trial on continuous daily sunitinib in primary glioblastoma at first recurrence (SURGE 01-07)</Artikel><Journal>Neuro-Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>Background Due to the redundancy of molecular pathways simultaneously involved in glioblastoma growth and angiogenesis, therapeutic approaches intervening at multiple levels seem particularly appealing. Methods This prospective, multicenter, single-arm phase II trial was designed to evaluate the antitumor activity of sunitinib, an oral small-molecule inhibitor of several receptor tyrosine kinases, in patients with first recurrence of primary glioblastoma using a continuous once-daily dosing regimen. Patients received a starting dose of sunitinib 37.5 mg, followed by a maintenance dose between 12.5 mg and 50 mg depending on drug tolerability. The primary endpoint was a 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate. Secondary endpoints included median PFS, overall survival (OS), safety/toxicity, quality of life, and translational studies on the expression of sunitinib target molecules. Results Forty participants were included in this study, and no objective responses were detected. PFS6 was 12.5%, median PFS 2.2 months, and median OS 9.2 months. Five participants (12.5%) showed prolonged stable disease &gt;/=6 months with a median PFS of 16.0 months (range, 6.4-41.4 mo) and a median OS of 46.9 months (range, 21.2-49.2 mo) for this subgroup. c-KIT expression in vascular endothelial cells (n = 14 participants) was associated with improved PFS. The most common toxicities were fatigue/asthenia, mucositis/dermatitis, dysesthesias, gastrointestinal symptoms, cognitive impairment, leukoctopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Two participants (5%) terminated treatment due to toxicity. Conclusion Continuous daily sunitinib showed minimal antiglioblastoma activity and substantial toxicity when given at higher doses. High endothelial c-KIT expression may define a subgroup of patients who will benefit from sunitinib treatment by achieving prolonged PFS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for FGFR1 and immunohistochemistry for pAKT, PI3K, HIF1a and Ki67 in 175 NSCLC brain metastases and 11 matched primary tumors. ALK gene rearrangement status was available from a previous study. We performed statistical correlations of clinical, histopathological and molecular data. RESULTS: FGFR1 amplifications were found in a total of 30/175 (17%) brain metastases: 4/21 (19%) squamous cell carcinomas, 20/130 (15.3%) adenocarcinomas, 2/12 (16.6%) adenosquamous carcinomas, 4/9 (44.4%) large cell carcinomas and 0/3 neuroendocrine large cell carcinoma. FGFR1 gene status was identical between primary tumors and brain metastases in 9/11 evaluable cases. In 2/11 cases (1 adenosquamous and 1 large cell carcinoma), FGFR1 amplifications were present only in the brain metastasis and not in the primary tumor. Furthermore, we found a significant positive correlation of ALK and FGFR1 gene amplification status in brain metastases (p&lt;0.001, Chi square test). Patients with high-level FGFR1 amplifications had significantly higher number of visceral metastases (p&lt;0.001, Chi square test). CONCLUSION: Our findings argue for an enrichment of FGFR1 amplifications in brain metastases of adenocarcinomas (where they were 5-fold more frequent than reported for primary tumors) and possibly also of other non-squamous carcinomas, but not in squamous cell carcinomas of the lung. These results may be relevant for targeted therapy and prophylaxis of NSCLC brain metastases.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>83 (1), 83-89</Feld596><PubVol>83</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>83</StrtPage><EndPage>89</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Preusser M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Berghoff AS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Berger W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Ilhan-Mutlu A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Dinhof C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Widhalm G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Dieckmann K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Wohrer A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Hackl M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="von Deimling A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Streubel B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Birner P" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24183471</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.lungcan.2013.10.004</DOI><KST>G380</KST><KEYWORD>RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL CARCINOMA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>46940</publishedID><Artikel>F2RL3 methylation in blood DNA is a strong predictor of mortality</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Epidemiology</Journal><ABSTr>Background: Smoking is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Smoking-related epigenetic biomarkers may open new avenues to better quantify the adverse health effects of smoking, and to better understanding of the underlying mechanisms. We aimed to evaluate the clinical implications of F2RL3 methylation, a novel epigenetic biomarker of smoking exposure disclosed by recent genome-wide methylation studies.

Methods: Blood DNA methylation at F2RL3 (also known as PAR-4) was quantified in baseline samples of 3588 participants aged 50-75 years in a large population-based prospective cohort study by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Deaths were recorded during a median follow-up of 10.1 years. The associations of methylation intensity and of smoking with all-cause, cardiovascular, cancer and other mortality were assessed by Cox's proportional hazards regression, controlling for potential confounding factors.

Results: Lower methylation intensity at F2RL3 was strongly associated with mortality. After adjustment for multiple covariates including smoking, hazard ratios [95% confidence interval (CI)] for death from any cause, cardiovascular disease, cancer or other causes were 2.60 (95% CI, 1.81-3.74), 2.45 (95% CI, 1.28-4.68), 2.94 (95% CI, 1.68-5.14) and 2.39 (95% CI, 1.11-5.16), respectively, in subjects in the lowest quartile of methylation intensity compared with subjects in the highest quartile. The associations with mortality outcomes were much stronger among men than among women. In addition, strong positive associations of smoking with each of the outcomes were substantially weakened, and almost disappeared when controlling for F2RL3 methylation intensity.

Conclusions: F2RL3 methylation is a strong predictor of mortality, including all-cause, cardiovascular, cancer and other mortality. Systemic adverse effects of smoking may be mediated by pathways associated with F2RL3 methylation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>43 (4), 1215-1225</Feld596><PubVol>43</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>1215</StrtPage><EndPage>1225</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Zhang Y" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Yang R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Burwinkel B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Breitling LP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Holleczek B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Schoettker B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24510982</PMID><DOI>10.1093/ije/dyu006</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THROMBIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CARDIOVASCULAR RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CIGARETTE-SMOKING</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATED RECEPTOR 4</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MARTINGALE-BASED RESIDUALS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>46947</publishedID><Artikel>Hypoxia-inducible factor pathway inhibition resolves tumor hypoxia and improves local tumor control after single-dose irradiation</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: To study the effects of BAY-84-7296, a novel orally bioavailable inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) activity, on hypoxia, microenvironment, and radiation response of tumors. METHODS AND MATERIALS: UT-SCC-5 and UT-SCC-14 human squamous cell carcinomas were transplanted subcutaneously in nude mice. When tumors reached 4 mm in diameter BAY-84-7296 (Bayer Pharma AG) or carrier was daily administered to the animals. At 7 mm tumors were either excised for Western blot and immunohistologic investigations or were irradiated with single doses. After irradiation animals were randomized to receive BAY-84-7296 maintenance or carrier. Local tumor control was evaluated 150 days after irradiation, and the dose to control 50% of tumors (TCD50) was calculated. RESULTS: BAY-84-7296 decreased nuclear HIF-1alpha expression. Daily administration of inhibitor for approximately 2 weeks resulted in a marked decrease of pimonidazole hypoxic fraction in UT-SCC-5 (0.5% vs 21%, P&lt;.0001) and in UT-SCC-14 (0.3% vs 19%, P&lt;.0001). This decrease was accompanied by a significant increase in fraction of perfused vessels in UT-SCC-14 but not in UT-SCC-5. Bromodeoxyuridine and Ki67 labeling indices were significantly reduced only in UT-SCC-5. No significant changes were observed in vascular area or necrosis. BAY-84-7296 before single-dose irradiation significantly decreased TCD50, with an enhancement ratio of 1.37 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13-1.72) in UT-SCC-5 and of 1.55 (95% CI 1.26-1.94) in UT-SCC-14. BAY-84-7296 maintenance after irradiation did not further decrease TCD50. CONCLUSIONS: BAY-84-7296 resulted in a marked decrease in tumor hypoxia and substantially reduced radioresistance of tumor cells with the capacity to cause a local recurrence after irradiation. The data suggest that reduction of cellular hypoxia tolerance by BAY-84-7296 may represent the primary biological mechanism underlying the observed enhancement of radiation response. Whether this mechanism contributes to the improved outcome of fractionated chemoradiation therapy warrants further investigation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>88 (1), 159-166</Feld596><PubVol>88</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>159</StrtPage><EndPage>166</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Helbig L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Koi L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bruechner K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Gurtner K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Hess-Stumpp H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Unterschemmann K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Pruschy M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Baumann M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Yaromina A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Zips D" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24331663</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.ijrobp.2013.09.047</DOI><KST>L301</KST><KST>L801</KST></row><row><publishedID>46955</publishedID><Artikel>Mutation of human Connexin43 amino acids S279/S282 increases protein stability upon treatment with epidermal growth factor</Artikel><Journal>Cell Biochemistry and Biophysics</Journal><ABSTr>Connexins are the structural units of gap junctions, structures allowing interchanging of information between the adjacent cells. Connexin43 (Cx43) is the most abundant gap junction protein. Cx43 can be degraded by lysosome- and proteasome-mediated processes upon internalisation of the entire structure. Only little is known about the role of phosphorylation during the gap junction degradation. In Cx43, a protein containing 14 amino acids susceptible to be phosphorylated, amino acids S279 and S282 are phosphorylated upon epidermal growth factor (EGF) treatment by erk1/2 MAP kinases. Here, we show that the wild-type Cx43 protein, as well as HeLa cells expressing the mutated Cx43 proteins S279A, S282A and S279A/S282A, is mainly located
at the plasma membrane. However, the protein stability is not altered in the isolated single mutants, whereas the double mutant S279A/S282A is strongly degradation impaired upon EGF treatment. This effect is not due to the decreased Cx43 internalisation, but seems to be related to a reduced ubiquitination.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>69 (2), 379-384</Feld596><PubVol>69</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>379</StrtPage><EndPage>384</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schmitt M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Leykauf K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Reinz E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Cheng H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Alonso A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Schenkel J" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24399133</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s12013-013-9811-5</DOI><KST>F050</KST><KST>W430</KST><KEYWORD>V-SRC</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIVING CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>UBIQUITINATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHOSPHORYLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>KINASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EGF</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TURNOVER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GAP-JUNCTION PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MAP KINASES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTERCELLULAR COMMUNICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>connexin43</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>46957</publishedID><Artikel>NDRG1 prognosticates the natural course of disease in WHO
grade II glioma</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Neuro-Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>There is a lack of relevant prognostic and predictive factors in neurooncology besides mutation of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1, codeletion of 1p/19q and promoter hypermethylation of O (6) -methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase. More importantly, there is limited translation of these factors into clinical practice. The cancer genome atlas data and also clinical correlative analyses suggest a pivotal role for the epidermal growth factor receptor /protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in both biology and the clinical course of gliomas. However, attempts to stratify gliomas by activating alterations in this pathway have failed thus far. The tumors of 40 patients with WHO grade II gliomas without immediate postoperative genotoxic treatment and known progression and survival status at a median follow-up of 12.2 years were analyzed for expression of the mTOR complex 2 downstream target N-myc downstream regulated gene (NDRG)1 using immunohistochemistry. Baseline characteristics for NDRG1 absent/low versus moderate/high patients were similar. Time to reintervention was significantly longer in the NDRG1 group (P = 0.026). NDRG1 may become a novel biomarker to guide the decision which WHOA degrees II glioma patients may be followed without postsurgical intervention and which patients should receive genotoxic treatment early on. Validation of this hypothesis will be possible with the observational arm of the RTOG 9802 and the pretreatment step of the EORTC 22033/26032 trials.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>117 (1), 25-32</Feld596><PubVol>117</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>25</StrtPage><EndPage>32</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Blaes, J."

Lesion classification was performed by visual inspection and by quantitative analysis of normalized T2 signal after segmentation of median nerve voxels.Results:In all patients and no controls, T2 lesions of individual fascicles were observed within upper arm median nerve trunk and strictly followed a somatotopic/internal topography: affected were those motor fascicles that will form the anterior interosseous nerve further distally while other fascicles were spared. Predominant lesion focus was at a mean distance of 14.6 5.4 cm proximal to the humeroradial joint. Discriminative power of quantitative T2 signal analysis and of qualitative lesion rating was high, with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity (p &lt; 0.0001). Fascicular T2 lesion patterns were rated as multifocal (n = 17), monofocal (n = 2), or indeterminate (n = 1) by 2 independent observers with strong agreement (kappa = 0.83).Conclusion:It has been difficult to prove the existence of fascicular/partial nerve lesions in spontaneous neuropathies using clinical and electrophysiologic findings. With MRN, fascicular lesions with strict somatotopic organization were observed in upper arm median nerve trunks of patients with AINS. Our data strongly support that AINS in the majority of cases is not a surgically treatable entrapment neuropathy but a multifocal mononeuropathy selectively involving, within the main trunk of the median nerve, the motor fascicles that continue distally to form the anterior interosseous nerve.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>82 (7), 598-606</Feld596><PubVol>82</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>598</StrtPage><EndPage>606</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Pham, M."

While the benefit of an additional radiotherapy of the pelvic lymph nodes is still under debate, the PLATIN 3 prospective phase II clinical trial was initiated to substantiate toxicity data on postoperative IMRT of the pelvic lymph nodes and the prostate bed.

Methods: From 2009 to 2011, 40 patients with high-risk prostate cancer after prostatectomy with pT3 R0/1 M0 or pT2 R1 M0 or a PSA recurrence and either &gt; 20% risk of lymph node involvement and inadequate lymphadenectomy or pN + were enrolled. Patients received two months of antihormonal treatment (AT) before radiotherapy. AT continuation was mandatory during radiotherapy and was recommended for another two years. IMRT of the pelvic lymph nodes (51.0 Gy) with a simultaneous integrated boost to the prostate bed (68.0 Gy) was performed in 34 fractions. PSA level, prostate-related symptoms and quality of life were assessed at regular intervals for 24 months.

Results: Of the 40 patients enrolled, 39 finished treatment as planned. Overall acute toxicity rates were low and no acute grade 3/4 toxicity occurred. Only 22.5% of patients experienced acute grade 2 gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity. During follow-up, 10.0% late grade 2 GI and 5.0% late grade 2 GU toxicity occurred, and one patient developed late grade 3 proctitis and enteritis. After a median observation time of 24 months the PLATIN 3 trial has shown in 97.5% of all patients sufficient safety and thus met its prospectively defined aims. After a median of 24 months, 34/38 patients were free of a PSA recurrence.

Conclusions: Postoperative whole-pelvis IMRT with an integrated boost to the prostate bed can be performed safely and without excessive toxicity.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>14 (), Art.

The NDNS rolling programme is a nationally representative survey of food consumption, nutrient intakes and nutritional status of people aged 1.5 years and over living in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The study population comprised survey members who completed three or four days of dietary recording and who provided a blood sample.

In order to achieve sufficient control of blood sugar levels and blood pressure in patients and thus to avoid complications and secondary diseases, a patient-centered disease management and support of patient self-management are essential. These functions can be partially delegated.

The DIANA study is an epidemiological physician-based prospective cohort study on new approaches for optimization of general practitioner care. The objectives were to investigate the current status of diabetes care as well as the consequences of a patient-centered treatment approach on the course of diabetes. Furthermore, the effectiveness of a supportive telephone counseling service over 12 months by trained medical practice personnel was investigated.

The DIANA study consists of a basic survey and an interventional study. A total of 38 general medical practices with 1,146 patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes were included. For the basic survey standardized questionnaires were completed by the patients and their physicians. Furthermore, blood samples were taken from patients for determination of HbA1c levels in a certified laboratory. Patients with HbA1c levels &gt; 7.5 % in the basic survey were eligible for inclusion in the interventional study. In this subpopulation of 204 patients the effectiveness of an intervention with telephone support by trained personnel from the medical practices in the study was investigated. The patients who agreed to participate were randomized to either the intervention group or the control group. The control group received usual care.

Mean HbA1c was 6.9 % in this sample and thus within the target corridor of the new German clinical practice guidelines on type 2 diabetes of 6.5-7.5 %. Nevertheless, about one fifth of the patients' values were above the corridor and thus in a dissatisfactory zone. In addition, participating patients had considerable comorbidities, such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, cardiac insufficiency, and depression. Another problem was medication adherence among patients. Self-reported medication adherence was associated with poor glycemic control, especially in men. Young, employed and unmarried patients and those with depression symptoms were particularly at risk. The intervention had only limited effects. The primary outcome HbA1c decreased likewise in both groups. A decrease of systolic blood pressure was observed in the intervention group, but which was not sustained after the end of the intervention. It was only after the end of the intervention that health-related quality of life improved in the intervention group.

There is a large problem group of diabetes patients with an unsatisfactory metabolic situation. General practitioners should concentrate on these patients and be aware that younger, employed and single as well as depressive patients are particularly affected. A long-term accompaniment by trained personnel could be useful.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>10 (3), 207-</Feld596><PubVol>10</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>207</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Rueter G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Mons U" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><DOI>10.1007/s11428-013-1117-0</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>GLYCEMIC CONTROL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MELLITUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VALIDITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTERVENTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MEDICATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>47149</publishedID><Artikel>GRHL1 acts as tumor suppressor in neuroblastoma and is negatively regulated by MYCN and HDAC3</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Research</Journal><ABSTr>Neuroblastoma is an embryonic solid tumor of neural crest origin and accounts for 11% of all cancer-related deaths in children. Novel therapeutic strategies are therefore urgently required. MYCN oncogene amplification, which occurs in 20% of neuroblastomas, is a hallmark of high risk. Here we aimed to exploit molecular mechanisms that can be pharmacologically addressed with epigenetically modifying drugs, such as HDAC inhibitors. GRHL1, a gene critical for Drosophila neural development, belonged to the genes most strongly responding to HDAC inhibitor treatment of neuroblastoma cells in a genome-wide screen. An increase in the histone H4 pan-acetylation associated with its promoter preceded transcriptional activation. Physically adjacent, HDAC3 and MYCN co-localized to the GRHL1 promoter and repressed its transcription. High-level GRHL1 expression in primary neuroblastomas correlated on transcriptional and translational levels with favorable patient survival and established clinical and molecular markers for favorable tumor biology, including lack of MYCN amplification. Enforced GRHL1 expression in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells with low endogenous GRHL1 levels abrogated anchorage-independent colony formation, inhibited proliferation and retarded xenograft growth in mice. GRHL1 knock-down in MYCN single-copy cells with high endogenous GRHL1 levels promoted colony formation. GRHL1 regulated 170 genes genome-wide, and most were involved in pathways regulated during neuroblastomagenesis, including nervous system development, proliferation, cell-cell adhesion, cell spreading and cellular differentiation. In summary, the data presented here indicate a significant role of HDAC3 in the MYCN-mediated repression of GRHL1 and suggest drugs that block HDAC3 activity and suppress MYCN expression as promising candidates for novel treatment strategies of high-risk neuroblastoma.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>74 (9), 2604-2616</Feld596><PubVol>74</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>2604</StrtPage><EndPage>2616</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Fabian J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Lodrini M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Oehme I" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schier MC" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Thole TM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hielscher T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Kopp-Schneider A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Opitz L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Capper D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="von Deimling A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Wiegand I" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Milde T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Mahlknecht U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Westermann F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="14" name="Popanda O" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Roels F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Hero B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Berthold F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Fischer M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Kulozik A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Witt O" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="21" name="Deubzer HE" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24419085</PMID><DOI>10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-1904</DOI><KST>C010</KST><KST>C060</KST><KST>G340</KST><KST>G380</KST><KST>B087</KST><KEYWORD>PEDIATRIC SOLID TUMORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>transcription</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CLASSIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INHIBITOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HISTONE DEACETYLASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECRUITMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>N-MYC</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>B-CELL LYMPHOMAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HIGH-RISK NEUROBLASTOMA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>47191</publishedID><Artikel>Reduced acute toxicity for adults with medulloblastoma treated with proton beam craniospinal irradiation</Artikel><Journal>Strahlentherapie und Onkologie</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>190 (1), 111-112</Feld596><PubVol>190</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>111</StrtPage><EndPage>112</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Krause M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Baumann M" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24306067</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00066-013-0492-1</DOI><KST>L301</KST></row><row><publishedID>47195</publishedID><Artikel>Radiolabeled anti-EGFR-antibody improves local tumor control after external beam radiotherapy and offers theragnostic potential</Artikel><Journal>Radiotherapy and Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: The effect of radioimmunotherapy (RIT) using the therapeutic radionuclide Y-90 bound to the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab combined with external beam irradiation (EBRT) (EBRIT) on permanent local tumor control in vivo was examined. METHODS: Growth delay was evaluated in three human squamous cell carcinoma models after RIT with [90Y]Y-(CHX-A''-DTPA)4-cetuximab (Y-90-cetuximab). The EBRT dose required to cure 50% of the tumors (TCD50) for EBRT alone or EBRIT was evaluated in one RIT-responder (FaDu) and one RIT-non-responder (UT-SCC-5). EGFR expression and microenvironmental parameters were evaluated in untreated tumors, bioavailability was visualized by PET using ([86Y]Y-(CHX-A''-DTPA)4-cetuximab (Y-86-cetuximab) and biodistribution using Y-90-cetuximab. RESULTS: In UT-SCC-8 and FaDu but not in UT-SCC-5 radiolabeled cetuximab led to significant tumor growth delay. TCD50 after EBRT was significantly decreased by EGFR-targeted RIT in FaDu but not in UT-SCC-5. In contrast to EGFR expression, parameters of the tumor micromilieu and in particular the Y-90-cetuximab biodistribution or Y-86-cetuximab visualization in PET correlated with the responsiveness to RIT or EBRIT. CONCLUSION: EGFR-targeted EBRIT can improve permanent local tumor control compared to EBRT alone. PET imaging of bioavailability of labeled cetuximab appears to be a suitable predictor for response to EBRIT. This theragnostic approach should be further explored for clinical translation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>110 (2), 362-369</Feld596><PubVol>110</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>362</StrtPage><EndPage>369</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Koi L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Bergmann R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bruechner K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Pietzsch J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Pietzsch HJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Krause M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Steinbach J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Zips D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Baumann M" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24440046</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.radonc.2013.12.001</DOI><KST>L301</KST><KST>L801</KST><KEYWORD>RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER STEM-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FRACTIONATED-IRRADIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PRECLINICAL EVALUATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NECK-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADVANCED HEAD</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SQUAMOUS-CELL CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NUDE-MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Y-90-LABELED CETUXIMAB</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IBRITUMOMAB TIUXETAN</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>47210</publishedID><Artikel>[Importance of nuclear medicine diagnostics in CUP syndrome]</Artikel><Journal>Radiologe</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>54 (2), 134-139</Feld596><PubVol>54</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>134</StrtPage><EndPage>139</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Winter,M.C."

In particular, redox-sensitive green fluorescent proteins (roGFPs) have attracted major interest as tools to monitor biological redox changes in real time and in vivo. Most recently, the engineering of a redox relay that combines glutaredoxin (Grx) with roGFP2 as a translational fusion (Grx1-roGFP2) led to a biosensor for the glutathione redox potential (E-GSH). The expression of this probe in mitochondria is of particular interest as mitochondria are the major source of oxidants, and their redox status is closely connected to cell fate decisions. While Grx1-roGFP2 can be expressed in mammalian mitochondria, it fails to enter mitochondria in various nonmammalian model organisms. Here we report that inversion of domain order from Grx1-roGFP2 to roGFP2-Grx1 yields a biosensor with perfect mitochondrial targeting while fully maintaining its biosensor capabilities. The redesigned probe thus allows extending in vivo observations of mitochondrial redox homeostasis to important nonmammalian model organisms, particularly plants and insects.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>19 (3), 379-386</Feld596><PubVol>19</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>379</StrtPage><EndPage>386</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Albrecht SC" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Sobotta MC" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bausewein D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Aller I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Hell R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Dick TP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Meyer AJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>23954927</PMID><DOI>10.1177/1087057113499634</DOI><KST>A160</KST><KEYWORD>ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GFP</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FLUORESCENT PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIVING PLANT-CELLS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>47234</publishedID><Artikel>Cancer survival in Lithuania after the restoration of independence: rapid improvements, but persisting major gaps</Artikel><Journal>Acta Oncologica</Journal><ABSTr>Background. Following restoration of political independence in 1990, Lithuania underwent rapid societal and economic changes. We aimed to assess trends in cancer survival in the first two decades following these changes.

Material and methods. We used population-based data from the Lithuanian Cancer Registry and period analysis techniques to examine trends in one-, 2-5- and five-year relative survival between 1995-1999 and 2005-2009 for 24 common cancers in Lithuania.

Results. Between 1995-1999 and 2005-2009, five-year relative survival increased significantly for 20 of 24 cancers, and for 10 cancers the increase exceeded 10% units. Five-year relative survival estimates reached 46%, 69% and 91% for colorectal, breast and prostate cancer in 2005-2009, respectively, while patients with testicular cancer, Hodgkin's or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma had a five-year relative survival of 77%, 75% and 50%, respectively.

Conclusion. We found a rapid increase in survival for most forms of common cancers in Lithuania between 1995 and 2009. Nevertheless, several cancers with effective therapies exhibit considerable gaps compared with Northern and Western European countries. Despite ongoing rises in survival, mortality declines are not yet manifesting for important common cancers such as breast and colorectal cancer. Rapid incidence rises suggest that increases in survival for prostate and thyroid cancers are massively influenced by early detection-related effects. Improving the availability of effective therapies, and carefully planned early detection programs may help to increase cancer survival in Lithuania in the future.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>53 (9), 1238-1244</Feld596><PubVol>53</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>1238</StrtPage><EndPage>1244</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Krilaviciute A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Smailyte G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Gondos A" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24669773</PMID><DOI>10.3109/0284186X.2014.888495</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>UP-TO-DATE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PERIOD ANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TESTICULAR CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COUNTRIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>UNITED-STATES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EUROPE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRENDS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MORTALITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POPULATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>47239</publishedID><Artikel>Fly-FUCCI - a versatile tool for studying cell proliferation in complex tissues</Artikel><Journal>Cell Reports</Journal><ABSTr>One promising approach for in vivo studies of cell proliferation is the FUCCI system (fluorescent ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator). Here, we report the development of a Drosophila-specific FUCCI system (Fly-FUCCI) that allows one to distinguish G1, S, and G2 phases of interphase. Fly-FUCCI relies on fluorochrome-tagged degrons from the Cyclin B and E2F1 proteins, which are degraded by the ubiquitin E3-ligases APC/C and CRL4(Cdt2), during mitosis or the onset of S phase, respectively. These probes can track cell-cycle patterns in cultured Drosophila cells, eye and wing imaginal discs, salivary glands, the adult midgut, and probably other tissues. To support a broad range of experimental applications, we have generated a toolkit of transgenic Drosophila lines that express the Fly-FUCCI probes under control of the UASt, UASp, QUAS, and ubiquitin promoters. The Fly-FUCCI system should be a valuable tool for visualizing cell-cycle activity during development, tissue homeostasis, and neoplastic growth.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>7 (2), 588-598</Feld596><PubVol>7</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>588</StrtPage><EndPage>598</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Zielke N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Korzelius J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Van Straaten M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Bender K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schuhknecht G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Dutta D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Xiang J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Edgar BA" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24726363</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.celrep.2014.03.020</DOI><KST>A220</KST><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA-REPLICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CYCLE PROGRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Drosophila</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MITOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STEM-CELL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>UBIQUITIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMAGINAL DISCS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>G1 PHASE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>47247</publishedID><Artikel>Radiopharmaceutical Therapy of Patients with Metastasized Melanoma with the Melanin-Binding Benzamide 131I-BA52</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Nuclear Medicine</Journal><ABSTr>The performance of cytotoxic drugs is defined by their selectivity of uptake and action in tumor tissue. Recent clinical responses achieved by treating metastatic malignant melanoma with therapeutic modalities based on gene expression profiling showed that malignant melanoma is amenable to systemic treatment. However, these responses are not persistent, and complementary targeted treatment strategies are required for malignant melanoma. Methods: Here we provide our experience with different labeling procedures for the radioiodination of benzamides and report on initial dosimetry data and the first therapeutic application of I-131-BA52, a novel melanin-binding benzamide in patients with metastatic malignant melanoma. Twenty-six adults with histologically documented metastasized malignant melanoma received a single dose of 235 +/- 62 MBq of I-123-BA52 for planar and SPECT/CT imaging. Nine patients were selected for radionuclide therapy and received a median of 4 GBq (minimum, 0.51 GBq; maximum, 6.60 GBq) of the beta-emitting radiopharmaceutical I-131-BA52. Results: A trimethyltin precursor-based synthesis demonstrated high radiochemical yields in the large-scale production of radioiodinated benzamides required for clinical application. I-123-BA52 showed specific uptake and long-term retention in tumor tissue with low transient uptake in the excretory organs. In tumor tissue, a maximum dose of 12.2 Gy per GBq of I-131-BA52 was calculated. The highest estimated dose to a normal organ was found for the lung (mean, 3.1 Gy/GBq). No relevant acute or mid-term toxicity was observed with the doses administered until now. Even though dosimetric calculations reveal that the doses applied in this early phase of clinical application can be significantly increased, we observed antitumor effects with follow-up imaging, and single patients of the benzamide-positive cohort of patients (3/5 of the patients receiving a dose &gt;4.3 GBq) demonstrated a surprisingly long survival of more than 2 y. Conclusion: These data indicate that systemic radionuclide therapy using (131)IBA52 as a novel approach for the therapy of malignant melanoma is of considerable potential. Future trials should be done to enhance the precision of dosimetry, validate the maximum tolerable dose, and evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment in a prospective manner.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>55 (1), 9-14</Feld596><PubVol>55</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>9</StrtPage><EndPage>14</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Mier,W."

Upon agonist treatment, the occupancy of its genomic binding regions increased, but only a modest change in the number of sites was revealed by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing, suggesting a rather static behavior. However, such genome-wide and biochemical approaches do not take into account the dynamic behavior of a transcription factor. Therefore, we characterized the nuclear dynamics of RXR during activation in single cells on the subsecond scale using live-cell imaging. By applying fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), techniques with different temporal and spatial resolutions, a highly dynamic behavior could be uncovered which is best described by a two-state model (slow and fast) of receptor mobility. In the unliganded state, most RXRs belonged to the fast population, leaving similar to 15% for the slow, chromatin-bound fraction. Upon agonist treatment, this ratio increased to similar to 43% as a result of an immediate and reversible redistribution. Coactivator binding appears to be indispensable for redistribution and has a major contribution to chromatin association. A nuclear mobility map recorded by light sheet microscopy-FCS shows that the ligand-induced transition from the fast to the slow population occurs throughout the nucleus. Our results support a model in which RXR has a distinct, highly dynamic nuclear behavior and follows hit-and-run kinetics upon activation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>34 (7), 1234-1245</Feld596><PubVol>34</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>1234</StrtPage><EndPage>1245</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Brazda,P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Krieger,J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Daniel, B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Jonas, D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Szekeres,I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Langowski, J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Tóth, K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Nagy, L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Vámosi, G" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24449763</PMID><DOI>10.1128/MCB.01097-13</DOI><KST>B040</KST><KEYWORD>transcription</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DYNAMICS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLUCOCORTICOID-RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIVING CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>fluorescence correlation spectroscopy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANOMALOUS DIFFUSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>intranuclear mobility</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HETERODIMERS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NUCLEAR HORMONE-RECEPTORS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>47253</publishedID><Artikel>Stem cell characteristics in glioblastoma are maintained by the ecto-nucleotidase E-NPP1</Artikel><Journal>Cell Death and Differentiation</Journal><ABSTr>Glioblastomas are highly aggressive brain tumours and are characterised by substantial cellular heterogeneity within a single tumour. A sub-population of glioblastoma stem-like cells (GSCs) that shares properties with neural precursor cells has been described, exhibiting resistance to therapy and therefore being considered responsible for the high recurrence rate in glioblastoma. To elucidate the underlying cellular processes we investigated the role of phosphatases in the GSC phenotype, using an in vitro phosphatome-wide RNA interference screen. We identified a set of genes, the knockdown of which induces a significant decrease in the glioma stem cell marker CD133, indicating a role in the glioblastoma stem-like phenotype. Among these genes, the ecto-nucleotidase ENPP1 (ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1) was found to be highly expressed in GSCs compared with normal brain and neural stem cells. Knockdown of ENPP1 in cultured GSCs resulted in an overall downregulation of stem cell-associated genes, induction of differentiation into astrocytic cell lineage, impairment of sphere formation, in addition to increased cell death, accumulation of cells in G1/G0 cell cycle phase and sensitisation to chemotherapeutic treatment. Genome-wide gene expression analysis and nucleoside and nucleotide profiling revealed that knockdown of ENPP1 affects purine and pyrimidine metabolism, suggesting a link between ENPP1 expression and a balanced nucleoside-nucleotide pool in GSCs. The phenotypic changes in E-NPP1-deficient GSCs are assumed to be a consequence of decreased transcriptional function of E2F1. Together, these results reveal that E-NPP1, by acting upstream of E2F1, is indispensable for the maintenance of GSCs in vitro and hence required to keep GSCs in an undifferentiated, proliferative state.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>21 (6), 929-940</Feld596><PubVol>21</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>929</StrtPage><EndPage>940</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Bageritz, J."

With this approach, both types of information as well as a regularization based on the Navier equation are directly integrated in a single energy minimizing functional. For this functional we have derived an analytic solution, which is based on matrix-valued non-radial basis functions. With our approach the full 3D intensity information is exploited, i.e., all voxels are considered and subsampling using a grid is not required. A special case of our hybrid approach is obtained by disregarding the landmark information, which results in a pure intensity-based elastic registration approach. We have successfully applied our approach to 3D synthetic images, 2D MR images of the human brain, 2D gel electrophoresis images, and 3D CT lung images.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>106 (1), 76-92</Feld596><PubVol>106</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>76</StrtPage><EndPage>92</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Woerz, S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Rohr, K" IsDKFZ="1"/><DOI>10.1007/s11263-013-0642-z</DOI><KST>B080</KST><KEYWORD>ALGORITHM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSFORMATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>2-DIMENSIONAL GEL-ELECTROPHORESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MEDICAL IMAGES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>elastic registration</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NONRIGID REGISTRATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THIN-PLATE SPLINES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CT images</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ROBUST</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REGULARIZATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>47341</publishedID><Artikel>3D morphometry using automated aortic segmentation in native MR angiography: An alternative to contrast enhanced MRA</Artikel><Journal>Cardiovascular Diagnosis and Therapy</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>4 (2), 80-87</Feld596><PubVol>4</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>80</StrtPage><EndPage>87</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Mueller-Eschner, M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Mueller, T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Biesdorf, A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Woerz, S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Rengier, F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Boeckler, D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Kauczor, HU" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Rohr, K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="von Tengg-Kobligk, H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24834406</PMID><DOI>10.3978/j.issn.2223-3652.2013.</DOI><KST>E010</KST><KST>B080</KST></row><row><publishedID>47342</publishedID><Artikel>Creating functional engineered variants of the single-module non-ribosomal peptide synthetase IndC by T domain exchange</Artikel><Journal>Molecular Biosystems</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>10 (7), 1709-1718</Feld596><PubVol>10</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>1709</StrtPage><EndPage>1718</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ralf Beer" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Konrad Herbst" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="...Dominik Niopek" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name=".....

In order to image and treat both PSMA positive and negative tissues PSMA targeting probes need to be extended by a further specificity. Since prostate cancer cells usually express both PSMA and gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) a bispecific low-molecular heterodimeric molecule, addressing both targets at the same time, may significantly improve prostate cancer imaging and therapy. METHODS The nonapeptide BZH3 representing the GRPR binding part was combined with the urea-based PSMA inhibitor Glu-urea-Lys(Ahx)-HBED-CC. The syntheses of the compounds were performed according to standard Fmoc-solid phase peptide synthesis. The binding properties were analyzed by competitive cell binding and internalization experiments. The in vivo targeting properties were investigated by means of biodistribution studies. RESULTS Cell binding experiments revealed high binding affinities to both GRPR and PSMA expressing cell lines. The heterodimer bound with IC50-values essentially matching the IC50 values of the respective monomers (25.0 +/- 5.4 nM for PSMA and 9.0 +/- 1.8 nM for GRPR, respectively). In vivo, the heterodimer showed dual targeting of PSMA (5.4%ID/g for PSMA-positive tumors) and GRPR receptors (3.3% ID/g for GRPR-positive tumors) while exhibiting fast pharmacokinetic properties. The clearance from background was comparable to the monomeric PSMA-targeting reference. CONCLUSIONS The heterodimeric molecule is a promising agent for PET imaging of primary and recurrent prostate cancer covering two receptor entities which might lead to an improved diagnostic sensitivity and therapeutic efficiency.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>74 (6), 659-668</Feld596><PubVol>74</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>659</StrtPage><EndPage>668</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Eder,M."

Although detection of DNA damage is attracting increasing attention, only a limited number of methods are available to quantify DNA lesions, and these techniques are tedious or only detect global DNA damage. In this study, we present a high-sensitivity long-run real-time PCR technique for DNA-damage quantification (LORD-Q) in both the mitochondrial and nuclear genome. While most conventional methods are of low-sensitivity or restricted to abundant mitochondrial DNA samples, we established a protocol that enables the accurate sequence-specific quantification of DNA damage in &gt;3-kb probes for any mitochondrial or nuclear DNA sequence. In order to validate the sensitivity of this method, we compared LORD-Q with a previously published qPCR-based method and the standard single-cell gel electrophoresis assay, demonstrating a superior performance of LORD-Q. Exemplarily, we monitored induction of DNA damage and repair processes in human induced pluripotent stem cells and isogenic fibroblasts. Our results suggest that LORD-Q provides a sequence-specific and precise method to quantify DNA damage, thereby allowing the high-throughput assessment of DNA repair, genotoxicity screening and various other processes for a wide range of life science applications.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>42 (6), Art.

We examined whether disturbed GJIC is responsible for a CSC phenotype in established and primary cancer cells and patient tissue of PDA using interdisciplinary methods based in physiology, cell and molecular biology, histology and epigenetics. Flux of fluorescent dyes and gemcitabine through gap junctions (GJs) was intact in less aggressive cells but not in highly malignant cells with morphological dysfunctional GJs. Among several connexins, only Cx43 was expressed on the cell surface of less aggressive and GJIC-competent cells, whereas Cx43 surface expression was absent in highly malignant, E-cadherin-negative and GJIC-incompetent cells. The levels of total Cx43 protein and Cx43 phosphorylated at Ser368 and Ser279/282 were high in normal tissue but low to absent in malignant tissue. si-RNA-mediated inhibition of Cx43 expression in GJIC-competent cells prevented GJIC and induced colony formation and the expression of stem cell-related factors. The bioactive substance sulforaphane enhanced Cx43 and E-cadherin levels, inhibited the CSC markers c-Met and CD133, improved the functional morphology of GJs and enhanced GJIC. Sulforaphane altered the phosphorylation of several kinases and their substrates and inhibition of GSK3, JNK and PKC prevented sulforaphane-induced CX43 expression. The sulforaphane-mediated expression of Cx43 was not correlated with enhanced Cx43 RNA expression, acetylated histone binding and Cx43 promoter de-methylation, suggesting that posttranslational phosphorylation is the dominant regulatory mechanism. Together, the absence of Cx43 prevents GJIC and enhances aggressiveness, whereas sulforaphane counteracts this process, and our findings highlight dietary co-treatment as a viable treatment option for PDA.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>5 (6), 1621-1634</Feld596><PubVol>5</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>1621</StrtPage><EndPage>1634</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Forster T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Rausch V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Zhang Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Isayev O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Heilmann,K."

This retrospective study was conducted on 304 patients with non-small cell lung cancers who underwent curative pulmonary resection (median follow-up for surviving patients, 3.6 years). IGF1R gene alterations (n = 304) and protein expression (n = 181) were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction based assays and immunohistochemistty, respectively. Membranous and cytoplasmic staining were analyzed separately. In an exploratory analysis, 1 silent mutation in exon 16 and 3 mutations in introns of the IGF1R gene comprising the tyrosine kinase domain were detected. Moreover, evaluating selected IGF1R SNPs, patients with adenocarcinomas and homozygous for the rs8038415 T-allele had a significantly better survival (P=.025) but no different disease-free survival. Regarding expression, membranous but not cytoplasmic IGF1R staining was higher in squamous cell carcinomas versus other histologies (P&lt;.0001) and showed a trend to longer survival (P=.08). No association between SNP variations and protein expression was found. Membranous IGF1R protein expression is higher in squamous cell versus other histologies but does not correlate with prognosis. SNPs and mutations can be detected and may harbor prognostic value. These alterations may be of interest when evaluating the IGF1R as potential therapeutic target and should receive further research.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>45 (6), 1162-1168</Feld596><PubVol>45</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>1162</StrtPage><EndPage>1168</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Reinmuth,N."

All study patients will receive standard therapy, i.e. highly conformal radiation techniques like CT-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with or without concomitant chemotherapy or other antitumor medication, and additionally daily short MR scans in treatment position with the same immobilisation equipment used for irradiation for position verification and imaging of the anatomical and functional changes during the course of radiotherapy. For daily position control, skin marks and a stereotactic frame will be used for both imaging modalities. Patient transfer between the MR device and the linear accelerator will be performed with a shuttle system which uses an air-bearing patient platform for both procedures. The daily acquired MR and CT data sets will be digitally registrated, correlated with the planning CT and compared with each other regarding translational and rotational errors. Aim of this clinical study is to establish a shuttle-based approach for realising MR-guided radiotherapy for certain clinical situations. Second objectives are to compare MR-guided radiotherapy with the gold standard of CT image guidance for quality assurance of radiotherapy, to establish an appropiate MR protocol therefore, and to assess the possibility of using MR-based image guidance not only for position verification but also for adaptive strategies in radiotherapy. DISCUSSION: Compared to CT, MRI might offer the advantage of providing IGRT without delivering an additional radiation dose to the patients and the possibility of optimisation of adaptive therapy strategies due to its superior soft tissue contrast. However, up to now, hybrid MR-linac devices are still under construction and not clinically applicable. For the near future, a shuttle-based approach would be a promising alternative for providing MR-guided radiotherapy, so that the present study was initiated to determine feasibility and safety of such an approach. Besides positioning information, daily MR data under treatment offer the possibility to assess tumor regression and functional parameters, with a potential impact not only on adaptive therapy strategies but also on early assessment of treatment response.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (1), Art.

Ultrasound (US) offers major advantages as an interventional imaging modality because it is real time and low cost and does not expose the patient or physician to harmful radiation. To advance US-related research, the purpose of this paper was to develop and evaluate an open-source framework for US-based CAI applications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed the open-source software module MITK-US for acquiring and processing US data as part of the well-known medical imaging interaction toolkit (MITK). To demonstrate its utility, we applied the module to implement a new concept for US-guided needle insertion. Performance of the US module was assessed by determining frame rate and latency for both a simple sample application and a more complex needle guidance system. RESULTS: MITK-US has successfully been used to implement both sample applications. Modern laptops achieve frame rates above 24 frames per second. Latency is measured to be approximately 250 ms or less. CONCLUSION: MITK-US can be considered a viable rapid prototyping environment for US-based CAI applications.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (3), 411-420</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>411</StrtPage><EndPage>420</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Maerz K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Franz AM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Seitel A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Winterstein A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Bendl R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Zelzer S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Nolden M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Meinzer HP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Maier-Hein L" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24343000</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s11548-013-0962-z</DOI><KST>E040</KST><KST>E130</KST><KST>E131</KST><KEYWORD>IMAGING INTERACTION TOOLKIT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ABLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SYSTEM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>liver</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CALIBRATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STANDARDIZED ASSESSMENT</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>47441</publishedID><Artikel>Temporal Lobe Reactions After Carbon Ion Radiation Therapy: Comparison of Relative Biological Effectiveness-Weighted Tolerance Doses Predicted by Local Effect Models I and IV</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics</Journal><ABSTr>Purpose: To compare the relative biological effectiveness (RBE)-weighted tolerance doses for temporal lobe reactions after carbon ion radiation therapy using 2 different versions of the local effect model (LEM I vs LEM IV) for the same patient collective under identical conditions.

Methods and Materials: In a previous study, 59 patients were investigated, of whom 10 experienced temporal lobe reactions (TLR) after carbon ion radiation therapy for low-grade skullbase chordoma and chondrosarcoma at Helmholtzzentrum fur Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany in 2002 and 2003. TLR were detected as visible contrast enhancements on T1-weighted MRI images within a median follow-up time of 2.5 years. Although the derived RBE-weighted temporal lobe doses were based on the clinically applied LEM I, we have now recalculated the RBE-weighted dose distributions using LEM IV and derived dose-response curves with Dmax, V-1 cm(3) (the RBE-weighted maximum dose in the remaining temporal lobe volume, excluding the volume of 1 cm(3) with the highest dose) as an independent dosimetric variable. The resulting RBE-weighted tolerance doses were compared with those of the previous study to assess the clinical impact of LEM IV relative to LEM I.

Results: The dose-response curve of LEM IV is shifted toward higher values compared to that of LEM I. The RBE-weighted tolerance dose for a 5% complication probability (TD5) increases from 68.8 +/- 3.3 to 78.3 +/- 4.3 Gy (RBE) for LEM IV as compared to LEM I.

Conclusions: LEM IV predicts a clinically significant increase of the RBE-weighted tolerance doses for the temporal lobe as compared to the currently applied LEM I. The limited available photon data do not allow a final conclusion as to whether RBE predictions of LEM I or LEM IV better fit better clinical experience in photon therapy. The decision about a future clinical application of LEMIV therefore requires additional analysis of temporal lobe reactions in a comparable photon-treated collective using the same dosimetric variable as in the present study.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>88 (5), 1136-1141</Feld596><PubVol>88</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>1136</StrtPage><EndPage>1141</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Gillmann,C."

We tested interactions between these dietary factors and approximately 2.7 million genetic variants for colorectal cancer risk among 9,287 cases and 9,117 controls from ten studies. We used logistic regression to investigate multiplicative gene-diet interactions, as well as our recently developed Cocktail method that involves a screening step based on marginal associations and gene-diet correlations and a testing step for multiplicative interactions, while correcting for multiple testing using weighted hypothesis testing. Per quartile increment in the intake of red and processed meat were associated with statistically significant increased risks of colorectal cancer and vegetable, fruit and fiber intake with lower risks. From the case-control analysis, we detected a significant interaction between rs4143094 (10p14/near GATA3) and processed meat consumption (OR = 1.17; p = 8.7E-09), which was consistently observed across studies (p heterogeneity = 0.78). The risk of colorectal cancer associated with processed meat was increased among individuals with the rs4143094-TG and -TT genotypes (OR = 1.20 and OR = 1.39, respectively) and null among those with the GG genotype (OR = 1.03). Our results identify a novel gene-diet interaction with processed meat for colorectal cancer, highlighting that diet may modify the effect of genetic variants on disease risk, which may have important implications for prevention.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>10 (4), e1004228-</Feld596><PubVol>10</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>e1004228</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Figueiredo JC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Hsu L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Hutter CM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Lin Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Campbell PT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Baron JA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Berndt SI" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Shuo J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Casey G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Fortini B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Chan AT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Cotterchio M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Lemire M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Gallinger S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Harrison TA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Le Marchand L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Newcomb PA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Slattery ML" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Caan BJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Carlson CS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Zanke BW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Rosse SA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="23" name="Giovannucci EL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Wu K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Chang-Claude J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="26" name="Chanock SJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Curtis KR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Duggan D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Gong J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Haile RW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Hayes RB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Hoffmeister M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="33" name="Hopper JL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Jenkins MA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Kolonel LN" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Qu C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Rudolph A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Schoen RE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Schumacher FR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Seminara D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Stelling DL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Thibodeau SN" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Thornquist M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="44" name="Warnick GS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="45" name="Henderson BE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="46" name="Ulrich CM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="47" name="Gauderman WJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="48" name="Potter JD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="49" name="White E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="50" name="and Peters U on behalf of CCFR and GECCO" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24743840</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pgen.1004228</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KST>C070</KST><KST>G110</KST><KEYWORD>ULCERATIVE-COLITIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLON-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FIBER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MULTIETHNIC COHORT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RED MEAT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METAANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASSOCIATION SCAN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>susceptibility loci</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>47451</publishedID><Artikel>Autologous stem cell transplantation for elderly patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in the era of novel agents</Artikel><Journal>Annals of Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: High-dose therapy (HDT) with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is considered the standard of care for multiple myeloma (MM) patients &lt;65 years. Safety and outcome of ASCT for patients &gt;65 years is currently uncertain, especially since the introduction of novel agents for induction and maintenance therapy. Furthermore, there are no conclusive data available on risk assessment in elderly patients treated with HDT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 202 patients &gt;/=60 years with newly diagnosed MM who underwent ASCT at our institution. Patients were stratified by age into three groups (60-64, 65-69 and 70-75 years). For safety assessment, we compared data about hospitalization, hematopoetic reconstitution and early mortality. Remission before and after ASCT was analyzed according to age and application of novel agents. Event-free (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed to identify impact of age, remission before/after ASCT and maintenance therapy as well as ISS score and cytogenetic aberrations on outcome in elderly patients. RESULTS: The assessment of safety, remission before/after ASCT as well as EFS and OS showed no significant differences between the three groups (median EFS: 60-64 years: 27 months; 65-69 years: 23 months; 70-75 years: 23 months; median OS: not reached). Patients receiving novel agents as part of induction therapy achieved significantly higher nCR + CR rates than patients treated without novel agents. In Cox regression analysis, ISS and cytogenetics as well as remission after ASCT had the highest prognostic impact on EFS and OS. Maintenance therapy was associated with longer EFS in uni- and multivariate analyses. CONCLUSION: ASCT is feasible for selected patients &gt;65 and &gt;70 years without increased mortality. Age at transplantation has no prognostic significance on outcome after ASCT. Novel agents during induction therapy and maintenance therapy improves outcome of older patients eligible for ASCT. ISS and cytogenetic analysis should be carried out routinely for risk assessment.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>25 (1), 189-195</Feld596><PubVol>25</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>189</StrtPage><EndPage>195</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Merz M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Neben K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Raab MS" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Sauer S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Egerer G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hundemer M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Hose D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Kunz C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Heiss C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Ho AD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Goldschmidt H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Hillengass J" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24356629</PMID><DOI>10.1093/annonc/mdt509</DOI><KST>E010</KST><KST>C060</KST><KST>G330</KST><KST>G170</KST><KEYWORD>MAINTENANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BORTEZOMIB</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SAFE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTERNATIONAL STAGING SYSTEM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MELPHALAN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONSENSUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRIAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INDUCTION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>47498</publishedID><Artikel>Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and survival in colorectal and breast cancer patients: Systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Aim: To estimate the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH) D) levels and survival among colorectal and breast cancer patients.

Methods: We performed a comprehensive literature search of prospective cohort studies assessing the association of serum 25(OH) D levels with survival in colorectal and breast cancer patients. Study characteristics and results were extracted and dose-response relationships were graphically displayed in a standardised manner. Meta-analyses using random effects models were performed to estimate pooled hazard ratios.

Results: The systematic search yielded five studies including 2330 colorectal cancer patients and five studies including 4413 breast cancer patients all of which compared mortality across two to five categories of 25(OH) D levels. Among colorectal cancer patients, pooled hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) comparing highest with lowest categories were 0.71 (0.55-0.91) and 0.65 (0.49-0.86) for overall and disease-specific mortality, respectively. For breast cancer patients, the corresponding pooled estimates were 0.62 (0.49-0.78) and 0.58 (0.38-0.84), respectively. No significant evidence of heterogeneity between studies was observed.

Conclusion: Higher 25(OH) D levels (&gt; 75 nmol/L) were associated with significantly reduced mortality in patients with colorectal and breast cancer. Randomised controlled trials are needed to evaluate whether vitamin D supplementation can improve survival in colorectal and breast cancer patients with low vitamin D status (25( OH) D &lt; 50 nmol/L) at diagnosis and before treatment.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>50 (8), 1510-1521</Feld596><PubVol>50</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>1510</StrtPage><EndPage>1521</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Maalmi H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Ordóñez-Mena JM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Schoettker B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24582912</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.ejca.2014.02.006</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>POLYMORPHISMS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPIDEMIOLOGY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WOMEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>chemotherapy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>D SUPPLEMENTATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VITAMIN-D STATUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>D DEFICIENCY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ULTRAVIOLET-B IRRADIANCE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>47505</publishedID><Artikel>Identification of novel, highly expressed retroviral microRNAs in cells infected by bovine foamy virus</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Virology</Journal><ABSTr>While numerous viral microRNAs (miRNAs) expressed by DNA viruses, especially herpesvirus family members, have been reported, there have been very few reports of miRNAs derived from RNA viruses. Here we describe three miRNAs expressed by bovine foamy virus (BFV), a member of the spumavirus subfamily of retroviruses, in both BFV-infected cultured cells and BFV-infected cattle. All three viral miRNAs are initially expressed in the form of an similar to 122-nucleotide (nt) pri-miRNA, encoded within the BFV long terminal repeat U3 region, that is subsequently cleaved to generate two pre-miRNAs that are then processed to yield three distinct, biologically active miRNAs. The BFV pri-miRNA is transcribed by RNA polymerase III, and the three resultant mature miRNAs were found to contribute a remarkable similar to 70% of all miRNAs expressed in BFV-infected cells. These data document the second example of a retrovirus that is able to express viral miRNAs by using embedded proviral RNA polymerase III promoters.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>88 (9), 4679-4686</Feld596><PubVol>88</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>4679</StrtPage><EndPage>4686</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Whisnant,A.W."

Hence, the burden of these clinical manifestations demands for a prophylactic approach. To evaluate whether protective efficacy of a vaccine is potentially translatable to patients, we used the rodent Mastomys coucha that is naturally infected with Mastomys natalensis papillomavirus (MnPV). This skin type papillomavirus induces not only benign skin tumours, such as papillomas and keratoacanthomas, but also squamous cell carcinomas, thereby allowing a straightforward read-out for successful vaccination in a small immunocompetent laboratory animal. Here, we examined the efficacy of a virus-like particle (VLP)-based vaccine on either previously or newly established infections. VLPs raise a strong and long-lasting neutralizing antibody response that confers protection even under systemic long-term cyclosporine A treatment. Remarkably, the vaccine completely prevents the appearance of benign as well as malignant skin tumors. Protection involves the maintenance of a low viral load in the skin by an antibody-dependent prevention of virus spread. Our results provide first evidence that VLPs elicit an effective immune response in the skin under immunocompetent and immunosuppressed conditions in an outbred animal model, irrespective of the infection status at the time of vaccination. These findings provide the basis for the clinical development of potent vaccination strategies against cutaneous HPV infections and HPV-induced tumors, especially in patients awaiting organ transplantation.

Author Summary Organ transplant recipients (OTR) frequently suffer from fulminant warts that are induced by cutaneous human papillomaviruses (HPV). Moreover, some skin HPV types may also be involved in the development of non-melanoma skin cancer. Mimicking the situation of immunosuppressed OTR who acquire cutaneous HPV infections already in childhood, we explored the efficacy of a vaccine in infected animals that additionally underwent immunosuppression. We demonstrate for the first time the success of a vaccine against a skin papillomavirus in a natural outbred animal system, which completely prevents both benign and malignant skin tumor formation even under immunosuppressed conditions. Hence, our study provides the basis for clinical development of a vaccine against cutaneous HPV infections, which may be particularly useful in transplant recipients.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>10 (2), e1003924-</Feld596><PubVol>10</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>e1003924</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Vinzon, S."

A substantial fraction of HPV-associated cancers is caused by HPV serotypes not included in the currently available vaccines. Among healthy women, both Cervarix (R) (HPV-16/18, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, GSK) and Gardasil (R) (HPV-6/11/16/18, Merck) have demonstrated partial cross-protection against certain oncogenic non-vaccine HPV-types. Currently, there are no available data on vaccine-induced cross-protection in men and little is known about cross-reactive immunity after HPV-vaccination of HIV-infected individuals.

In an investigator-initiated trial, we randomized 91 HIV-positive men and women to receive vaccination with Cervarix (R) or Gardasil (R). The HPV-DNA status of the participants was determined with pcr before and after immunization. Cross-reactive antibody responses against HPV-31, HPV-33, and HPV-45 were evaluated for up to 12 months using a pseudovirion-based neutralization assay (PBNA). Geometric mean antibody titers (GMTs) were compared among vaccine groups and genders at 7 and 12 months.

Both vaccines induced anti-HPV-31, -33, and -45 neutralizing antibodies in participants who were seronegative and HPV-DNA negative for those types at study entry. Geometric mean antibody titers were comparable between vaccine groups. Interestingly, anti-HPV-31 and -33 antibody titers were higher among women compared with men at 7 and 12 months.

In conclusion, both licensed HPV-vaccines induced cross-neutralizing antibodies against frequent oncogenic non-vaccine serotypes HPV-31, HPV-33, and HPV-45 in HIV-infected adults, and women had greater serological responses against HPV-31 and -33 compared with men.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>10 (5), 1147-1154</Feld596><PubVol>10</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>1147</StrtPage><EndPage>1154</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Toft,L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Tolstrup,M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Mueller,M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Sehr,P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Bonde, J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Storgaard,M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Østergaard, L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Søgaard, OS" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24553190</PMID><DOI>10.4161/hv.28192</DOI><KST>F035</KST><KEYWORD>METAANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PARTICLE VACCINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SAFETY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INVASIVE CERVICAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WOMEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECOMBINANT VACCINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CROSS-PROTECTIVE EFFICACY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AGED 16-26 YEARS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HPV-16/18 AS04-ADJUVANTED VACCINE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>47515</publishedID><Artikel>Oncogenic Human Papillomaviruses Activate the Tumor-Associated Lens Epithelial-Derived Growth Factor (LEDGF) Gene</Artikel><Journal>PloS Pathogens</Journal><ABSTr>The expression of the human papillomavirus (HPV) E6/E7 oncogenes is crucial for HPV-induced malignant cell transformation. The identification of cellular targets attacked by the HPV oncogenes is critical for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of HPV-associated carcinogenesis and may open novel therapeutic opportunities. Here, we identify the Lens Epithelial-Derived Growth Factor (LEDGF) gene as a novel cellular target gene for the HPV oncogenes. Elevated LEDGF expression has been recently linked to human carcinogenesis and can protect tumor cells towards different forms of cellular stress. We show that intracellular LEDGF mRNA and protein levels in HPV-positive cancer cells are critically dependent on the maintenance of viral oncogene expression. Ectopic E6/E7 expression stimulates LEDGF transcription in primary keratinocytes, at least in part via activation of the LEDGF promoter. Repression of endogenous LEDGF expression by RNA interference results in an increased sensitivity of HPV-positive cancer cells towards genotoxic agents. Immunohistochemical analyses of cervical tissue specimens reveal a highly significant increase of LEDGF protein levels in HPV-positive lesions compared to histologically normal cervical epithelium. Taken together, these results indicate that the E6/E7-dependent maintenance of intracellular LEDGF expression is critical for protecting HPV-positive cancer cells against various forms of cellular stress, including DNA damage. This could support tumor cell survival and contribute to the therapeutic resistance of cervical cancers towards genotoxic treatment strategies in the clinic.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>10 (3), e1003957-</Feld596><PubVol>10</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>e1003957</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Leitz J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Reuschenbach M."

recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes from melanoma patients</Artikel><Journal>Immunobiology</Journal><ABSTr>Background: Melanocortin 1 Receptor (MC1R) is expressed in a majority of melanoma biopsies and cell lines. We previously demonstrated that three hydrophobic low-affinity HLA-A2-restricted MC1R-derived peptides: MC1R(291-298), MC1 R244-252 and Mc1 R283-291 can elicit cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) responses from normal donor peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). Moreover, peptide-specific CTL recognized a panel of MHC-matched melanomas, demonstrating that human melanoma cell lines naturally present MC1R epitopes. However, the natural presence of MC1R-specific T cells in melanoma patient's tumour and blood remains unknown.

Methods: The presence of anti-MC1R specific CD8(+) T cells was established in a population of melanoma-specific T cells derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) from HLA-A2(+) melanoma patients.

Results: CTLs specific for the three MC1R-derived peptides that lysed allogeneic HLA-A2(+)MC1R(+) melanomas were elicited from PBMC, demonstrating the existence of an anti-MC1R T cell repertoire in melanoma patients. Moreover, TILs also recognized MC1R epitopes and HLA-A2(+) melanoma cell lines. Finally, HLA-A2/MC1R(244)-specific CD8(+) T cell clones derived from TILs and a subset of MCI R-291 specific TILs were identified using HLA-A2/MC1R tetramers.

Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that MC1R-derived peptides are common immunogenic epitopes for melanoma-specific CTLs and TILs, and may thus be useful for the development of anti-melanoma immunotherapy.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>219 (3), 189-197</Feld596><PubVol>219</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>189</StrtPage><EndPage>197</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="González FE, Ramírez M, Allerbring EB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Fasching N, Lundqvist A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Poschke I" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Achour A, Salazar-Onfray F" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24192537</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.imbio.2013.10.002</DOI><KST>G180</KST><KEYWORD>HLA-A2 MELANOMAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SELF-TOLERANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL RESPONSES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANTIGEN GP100</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REACTIVE CTL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MALIGNANT-MELANOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER-PATIENTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VACCINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHASE-I</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>47572</publishedID><Artikel>Src activity is increased in gastrointestinal stromal tumors - analysis of associations with clinical and other molecular tumor characteristics</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Surgical Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>Background

Increased activity of Src has been found in several human cancers, and often is associated with poor clinical outcome. The present study aimed to determine whether Src activity is increased in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), and whether it correlates with established tumor or patient characteristics and prognosis.

Methods

Tumor/normal tissues of 29 patients were analyzed for Src activity/protein with kinase assays, and for VEGF/VEGFR with immunohistochemical staining.

Results

Src activity was higher in tumor than in normal tissues (P = 0.093). However, when imatinib responders were excluded from the analyses, it was significantly higher in the tumor tissue (P = 0.017). Additionally, it was higher in primary compared to recurrent tumors or metastasis (P = 0.04). Univariate survival analysis showed a longer overall survival for patients with high Src activity (P = 0.038). In multivariate analysis, the response to imatinib treatment was the only survival-influencing factor (P = 0.072).

Conclusions

Src activity is increased in GIST. In contrast to most other tumor entities, it does not correlate with poor clinical outcome, but decreases during the progression from primary tumor to recurrence and metastasis, especially under therapy with imatinib. Additionally, our results show that higher Src activity is associated with longer overall survival.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>109 (6), 597-605</Feld596><PubVol>109</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>597</StrtPage><EndPage>605</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Rotert,J.V."

Since calcium signalling is known to regulate the development of degenerative processes in many cell types, it is believed to play significant roles in mediating neurodegeneration. Because of its function as a major juncture linking various insults and injuries associated with inflammatory attack on neuronal cell bodies and axons, it provides potential for the development of neuroprotective strategies. This is of great significance because of the lack of neuroprotective agents presently available to supplement the current array of immunomodulatory treatments. In this review, we summarise the role that various calcium channels and pumps have been shown to play in the development of neurodegeneration under inflammatory autoimmune conditions. The identification of suitable targets might also provide insights into applications in non-inflammatory neurodegenerative diseases.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>357 (2), 455-462</Feld596><PubVol>357</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>455</StrtPage><EndPage>462</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Fairless R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Williams SK" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Diem R" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24326615</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00441-013-1758-8</DOI><KST>G370</KST></row><row><publishedID>47584</publishedID><Artikel>BRAF-Mutated Pleomorphic Xanthoastrocytoma is Associated with Temporal Location, Reticulin Fiber Deposition and CD34 Expression</Artikel><Journal>Brain Pathology</Journal><ABSTr>BRAF V600E mutation and homozygous deletion of CDKN2A (p16) are frequent molecular alterations in pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (PXAs). We investigated 49 PXAs for clinical, histological and immunohistochemical characteristics related to BRAF mutation status. BRAF mutation was detected by immunohistochemical assay and DNA sequencing in 38/49 (78%) tumors. All but one PXA located in the temporal lobe harbored a BRAF V600E mutation (23/24; 96%) compared with 10/19 nontemporal PXAs (53%; P = 0.0009). Histological and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated increased reticulin deposition (76% vs. 27%; P = 0.003) and a more frequent expression of CD34 in BRAF-mutant PXAs (76% vs. 27%; P = 0.003). We further investigated the utility of combined BRAF V600E (VE1) and p16 analysis by immunohistochemistry to distinguish PXAs from relevant histological mimics like giant-cell glioblastoma. Among PXAs, 38/49 (78%) were VE1-positive, and 30/49 (61%) had a loss of p16 expression. The combined features (VE1 positivity/p16 loss) were observed in 25/49 PXAs (51%) but were not observed in giant-cell glioblastoma (VE1 0/28, p16 loss 14/28). We demonstrate that temporal location, reticulin deposition and CD34 expression are associated with BRAF mutation in PXA. Combined VE1 positivity and p16 loss represents a frequent immunoprofile of PXA and may therefore constitute an additional diagnostic tool for its differential diagnosis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>24 (3), 221-229</Feld596><PubVol>24</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>221</StrtPage><EndPage>229</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Koelsche C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Sahm F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Woehrer A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Jeibmann A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schittenhelm J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Kohlhof P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Preusser M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Romeike B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Dohmen-Scheufler H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Hartmann C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Mittelbronn M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Becker A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="von Deimling A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Capper D" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24345274</PMID><DOI>10.1111/bpa.12111</DOI><KST>G380</KST><KST>L501</KST><KST>L801</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>DYSEMBRYOPLASTIC NEUROEPITHELIAL TUMORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LOW-GRADE GLIOMAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BRAF(V600E) MUTATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>V600E mutation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CASE SERIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THYROID-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LESIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DELETION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>immunohistochemistry</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>47616</publishedID><Artikel>Evaluation of microvascular permeability with dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI for the differentiation of primary CNS lymphoma and glioblastoma: radiologic-pathologic correlation</Artikel><Journal>American Journal of Neuroradiology</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging can provide in vivo assessment of the microvasculature in intracranial tumors. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging derived vascular permeability parameters, including the volume transfer constant, the volume of extravascular extracellular space, and the flux rate constant between the extravascular extracellular space and plasma, for the differentiation of primary CNS lymphoma and glioblastoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty glioblastomas and 11 primary central nervous system lymphomas were included. Pretreatment T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging with a 3D T1-weighted spoiled gradient-echo sequence was performed on a 3T MR imaging scanner. Perfusion parameters (volume transfer constant, the volume of extravascular extracellular space, and the flux rate constant) were measured on the basis of the Tofts-Kernmode model. The Mann-Whitney U test and receiver operating characteristic analysis were used to compare those parameters between primary central nervous system lymphoma and glioblastoma. Histopathologic correlation of dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging findings was performed by using reticulin staining and CD31 immunohistochemistry.

RESULTS: Median volume transfer constant and flux rate constant values were significantly higher in primary central nervous system lymphoma (0.145 +/- 0.057 and 0.396 +/- 0.088) than in glioblastoma (0.064 +/- 0.021 and 0.230 +/- 0.058) (P &lt; .001, respectively). Median volume of extravascular extracellular space values did not differ significantly between primary central nervous system lymphoma (0.434 +/- 0.165) and glioblastoma (0.319 +/- 0.107). On receiver operating characteristic analysis, volume transfer constant had the best discriminative value for differentiating primary central nervous system lymphoma and glioblastoma (threshold, 0.093; sensitivity, 90.9%; specificity, 95.0%). Histopathologic evaluation revealed intact vascular integrity in glioblastoma despite endothelial proliferation, whereas primary central nervous system lymphoma demonstrated destroyed vessel architecture, thereby promoting vascular disintegrity.

CONCLUSIONS: Primary central nervous system lymphoma demonstrated significantly higher volume transfer constant and flux rate constant values compared with glioblastoma, implying a higher vascular permeability in primary central nervous system lymphoma. These findings confirm initial observations from perfusion CT and dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging studies, correlating with underlying histopathologic features, and may be useful in distinguishing primary central nervous system lymphoma from glioblastoma.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>35 (8), 1503-1508</Feld596><PubVol>35</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>1503</StrtPage><EndPage>1508</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kickingereder, P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Sahm,F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Heiland, S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Roethke, M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Wiestler, B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Schlemmer, H-P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Wick, W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="von Deimling, A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Bendszus, M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Radbruch, A" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24722313</PMID><DOI>10.3174/ajnr.A3915</DOI><KST>E010</KST><KST>G380</KST><KST>G370</KST><KST>L101</KST><KST>E012</KST><KEYWORD>TUMORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>physiology</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GRADE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CEREBRAL BLOOD-VOLUME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLIOMAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>T-2-ASTERISK-DOMINANT EXTRAVASATION CORRECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VASCULAR INPUT FUNCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LEAKAGE CORRECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CEDIRANIB</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>47618</publishedID><Artikel>Progression types after anti-angiogenic therapy are related to outcome in recurrent glioblastoma</Artikel><Journal>Neurology</Journal><ABSTr>Objective:This retrospective study analyzed whether the type of radiologic progression, classified according to contrast enhancement on MRI T1-weighted sequences and changes in T2-hyperintense signal, is relevant for outcome in patients with progressive glioblastoma (pGB) treated with bevacizumab.Methods:MRI scans of 83 patients with pGB treated with bevacizumab were evaluated prior to and at disease progression. Based on initial decrease in and subsequent flare-up of contrast enhancement in T1 and 2 patterns of T2-hyperintense tumor progression, progression types (PTs) were categorized as cT1 flare-up, T2-diffuse, T2-circumscribed, or primary nonresponder. Overall survival (OS), survival from start of bevacizumab therapy (OS_Bev), survival after bevacizumab failure (OS_PostBev), time from initial diagnosis until initiation of bevacizumab therapy (StartBevT), and time to bevacizumab progression were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank test, and Cox regression analyses.Results:The time observed for development of a T2-diffuse (n = 15) or a cT1 flare-up (n = 35) progression was longer than for progression in primary nonresponders (n = 16) or T2-circumscribed progression (n = 17). The T2-diffuse PT showed longer OS, OS_Bev, OS_PostBev, and StartBevT compared to the other PTs. Postprogression therapy tended to be relevant only for patients with a T2-circumscribed PT.Conclusions:Radiologic PTs following bevacizumab treatment failure show differences in time to development and are related to outcome. We therefore hypothesize that these PTs reflect a different glioma biology, including differential resistance mechanisms to bevacizumab, and may be associated with different responses to postprogression therapy.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>82 (19), 1684-1692</Feld596><PubVol>82</PubVol><PubIss>19</PubIss><StrtPage>1684</StrtPage><EndPage>1692</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Nowosielski, M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Wiestler,B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Goebel, G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Hutterer, M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schlemmer, H-P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Stockhammer,G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Wick, W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Bendszus, M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Radbruch, A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="(*shared first authorship)" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24727314</PMID><DOI>10.1212/WNL.0000000000000402</DOI><KST>E010</KST><KST>G370</KST><KST>E012</KST><KEYWORD>MULTIFORME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MALIGNANT GLIOMAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HIGH-GRADE GLIOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BEVACIZUMAB PLUS IRINOTECAN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATTERNS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>resistance</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>chemotherapy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INVASION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANGIOGENESIS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>47630</publishedID><Artikel>Morphological and physiological properties of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-expressing wide-field amacrine cells in the ChAT-EGFP mouse line</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Neuroscience</Journal><ABSTr>Mammalian retinas comprise a variety of interneurons, among which amacrine cells represent the largest group, with more than 30 different cell types each exhibiting a rather distinctive morphology and carrying out a unique function in retinal processing. However, many amacrine types have not been studied systematically because, in particular, amacrine cells with large dendritic fields, i.e. wide-field amacrine cells, have a low abundance and are therefore difficult to target. Here, we used a transgenic mouse line expressing the coding sequence of enhanced green fluorescent protein under the promoter for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT-EGFP mouse) and characterized a single wide-field amacrine cell population monostratifying in layer 2/3 of the inner plexiform layer (WA-S2/3 cell). Somata of WA-S2/3 cells are located either in the inner nuclear layer or are displaced to the ganglion cell layer and exhibit a low cell density. Using immunohistochemistry, we show that WA-S2/3 cells are presumably GABAergic but may also release acetylcholine as their somata are weakly positive for ChAT. Two-photon-guided patch-clamp recordings from intact retinas revealed WA-S2/3 cells to be ON-OFF cells with a homogenous receptive field even larger than the dendritic field. The large spatial extent of the receptive field is most likely due to the extensive homologous and heterologous coupling among WA-S2/3 cells and to other amacrine cells, respectively, as indicated by tracer injections. In summary, we have characterized a novel type of GABAergic ON-OFF wide-field amacrine cell which is ideally suited to providing long-range inhibition to ganglion cells due to its strong coupling.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>39 (5), 800-810</Feld596><PubVol>39</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>800</StrtPage><EndPage>810</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Knop GC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Pottek M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Monyer H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Weiler R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Dedek K" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24299612</PMID><DOI>10.1111/ejn.12443</DOI><KST>A230</KST></row><row><publishedID>47654</publishedID><Artikel>Health care costs in the elderly in Germany: an analysis applying Andersens behavioral model of health care utilization</Artikel><Journal>Health Services Research</Journal><ABSTr>Background: To analyze the association of health care costs with predisposing, enabling, and need factors, as defined by Andersen's behavioral model of health care utilization, in the German elderly population.

Methods: Using a cross-sectional design, cost data of 3,124 participants aged 57-84 years in the 8 year follow up of the ESTHER cohort study were analyzed. Health care utilization in a 3-month period was assessed retrospectively through an interview conducted by trained study physicians at respondents' homes. Unit costs were applied to calculate health care costs from the societal perspective. Socio-demographic and health-related variables were categorized as predisposing, enabling, or need factors as defined by the Andersen model. Multimorbidity was measured by the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics (CIRS-G). Mental health status was measured by the SF-12 mental component summary (MCS) score. Sector-specific costs were analyzed by means of multiple Tobit regression models.

Results: Mean total costs per respondent were 889 [sic] for the 3-month period. The CIRS-G score and the SF-12 MCS score representing the need factor in the Andersen model were consistently associated with total, inpatient, outpatient and nursing costs. Among the predisposing factors, age was positively associated with outpatient costs, nursing costs, and total costs, and the BMI was associated with outpatient costs.

Conclusions: Multimorbidity and mental health status, both reflecting the need factor in the Andersen model, were the dominant predictors of health care costs. Predisposing and enabling factors had comparatively little impact on health care costs, possibly due to the characteristics of the German social health insurance system. Overall, the variables used in the Andersen model explained only little of the total variance in health care costs.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>14 (1), Art.

Here, we show a hitherto unrecognized regulatory role of vimentin intermediate filaments (IFs) in this process. By studying fibroblasts in which vimentin IFs were decoupled from FAs, either because of vimentin deficiency (V0) or loss of vimentin network anchorage due to deficiency in the cytolinker protein plectin (P0), we demonstrate attenuated activation of the major mechanosensor molecule FAK and its downstream targets Src, ERK1/2, and p38, as well as an up-regulation of the compensatory feedback loop acting on RhoA and myosin light chain. In line with these findings, we show strongly reduced FA turnover rates in P0 fibroblasts combined with impaired directional migration, formation of protrusions, and up-regulation of stretched high-affinity integrin complexes. By exploiting tension-independent conditions, we were able to mechanistically link these defects to diminished cytoskeletal tension in both P0 and V0 cells. Our data provide important new insights into molecular mechanisms underlying cytoskeleton-regulated mechanosensing, a feature that is fundamental for controlled cell movement and tumor progression.Gregor, M., Osmanagic-Myers, S., Burgstaller, G., Wolfram, M., Fischer, I., Walko, G., Resch, G.

Additional information on NSCLC cell lines such as that of transcriptomic data, genomic aberrations, and drug sensitivity was analyzed in the context of proteomic data using supervised and non-supervised approaches for data analysis. First, the unsupervised analysis of proteomic data indicated that proteins clustering closely together reflect well-known signaling modules, e.g. PI3K/AKT- and RAS/RAF/ERK-signaling, cell cycle regulation, and apoptosis. However, mutations of EGFR, ERBB2, RAF, RAS, TP53, and PI3K were found dispersed across different signaling pathway clusters. Merely cell lines with an amplification of EGFR and/or ERBB2 clustered closely together on the proteomic, but not on the transcriptomic level. Secondly, supervised data analysis revealed that sensitivity towards anti-EGFR drugs generally correlated better with high level EGFR phosphorylation than with EGFR abundance itself. High level phosphorylation of RB and high abundance of AURKA were identified as candidates that can potentially predict sensitivity towards the aurora kinase inhibitor VX680. Examples shown demonstrate that the RPPA approach presents a useful platform for targeted proteomics with high potential for biomarker discovery.

Herein, we evaluated a cohort of 52 solitary fibrous tumors/hemangiopericytomas by whole-exome sequencing (one case) and multiplex RT-PCR (all 52 cases), and identified 12 different NAB2-STAT6 fusion variants in 48 cases (92%). All 52 cases showed strong and diffuse nuclear positivity for STAT6 by IHC. We categorized the fusion variants according to their potential functional effects within the predicted fusion protein and found strong correlations with relevant clinicopathological features. Tumors with the most common fusion variant, NAB2ex4-STAT6ex2/3, corresponded to classic pleuropulmonary solitary fibrous tumors with diffuse fibrosis and mostly benign behavior and occurred in older patients (median age, 69 years). In contrast, tumors with the second most common fusion variant, NAB2ex6-STAT6ex16/17, were found in much younger patients (median age, 47 years) and represented typical hemangiopericytomas from deep soft tissue with a more aggressive phenotype and clinical behavior. In summary, these molecular genetic findings support the concept that classic pleuropulmonary solitary fibrous tumor and deep-seated hemangiopericytoma are separate entities that share common features but correlate to different clinical outcome.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>184 (4), 1209-1218</Feld596><PubVol>184</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>1209</StrtPage><EndPage>1218</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Barthelmess S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Geddert H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Boltze C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Moskalev EA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Bieg M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Sirbu H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Brors B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Wiemann S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Hartmann A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Agaimy A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Haller F" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24513261</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.ajpath.2013.12.016</DOI><KST>B050</KST><KST>B080</KST><KST>W110</KST><KEYWORD>STAT6</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEMANGIOPERICYTOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SPECTRUM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATTERN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NAB2</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>transcription</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TISSUE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IDENTIFICATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>47721</publishedID><Artikel>Role of miR-34a as a suppressor of L1CAM in endometrial carcinoma</Artikel><Journal>Oncotarget</Journal><ABSTr>L1CAM promotes cell motility, invasion and metastasis formation in various human cancers and can be considered as a driver of tumor progression. Knowledge about genetic processes leading to the presence of L1CAM in cancers is of considerable importance. Experimentally, L1CAM expression can be achieved by various means. Over-expression of the transcription factor SLUG or treatment of cells with TGF-beta1 can induce or augment L1CAM levels in cancer cells. Likewise, hypomethylation of the L1CAM promoter on the X chromosome correlates with L1CAM expression. However, presently no mechanisms that might control transcriptional activity are known. Here we have identified miR-34a as a suppressor of L1CAM. We observed that L1CAM positive endometrial carcinoma (EC) cell lines HEC1B and SPAC1L lost L1CAM protein and mRNA by treatment with demethylating agents or knock-down of the DNA-methyltransferase-1 (DNMT1). Concomitantly, several miRNAs were up-regulated. Using miRNA profiling, luciferase reporter assays and mutagenesis, we identified miR-34a as a putative binder to the L1CAM-3'UTR. Over-expression of miR-34a in HEC1B cells blocked L1CAM expression and inhibited cell migration. In ECC1 cells (wildtype p53) the activation of p53 caused miR-34a up-regulation and loss of L1CAM expression that was miR-34a dependent. We observed an inverse correlation between L1CAM and miR-34a levels in EC cell lines. In primary tumor sections areas expressing high amounts of L1CAM had less miR-34a expression than those with low L1CAM levels. Our data suggest that miR-34a can regulate L1CAM expression by targeting L1CAM mRNA for degradation. These findings shed new light on the complex regulation of L1CAM in human tumors.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>5 (2), 462-472</Feld596><PubVol>5</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>462</StrtPage><EndPage>472</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schirmer U" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Doberstein K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Rupp AK" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Bretz NP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Wuttig D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Kiefel H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Breunig C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Fiegl H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Mueller-Holzner E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Zeillinger R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Schuster E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Zeimet AG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Sueltmann H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Altevogt P" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24497324</PMID><KST>B050</KST><KST>D015</KST><KST>B063</KST><KEYWORD>UP-REGULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>p53</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MIGRATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HALLMARKS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MicroRNAs</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>cell invasion</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPITHELIAL-MESENCHYMAL TRANSITIONS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>47728</publishedID><Artikel>Protein signatures of oxidative stress response in a patient specific cell line model for autism</Artikel><Journal>Molecular Autism</Journal><ABSTr>Background: Known genetic variants can account for 10% to 20% of all cases with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Overlapping cellular pathomechanisms common to neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) and in tissues of peripheral organs, such as immune dysregulation, oxidative stress and dysfunctions in mitochondrial and protein synthesis metabolism, were suggested to support the wide spectrum of ASD on unifying disease phenotype. Here, we studied in patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) how an ASD-specific mutation in ribosomal protein RPL10 (RPL10[H213Q]) generates a distinct protein signature. We compared the RPL10[ H213Q] expression pattern to expression patterns derived from unrelated ASD patients without RPL10[ H213Q] mutation. In addition, a yeast rpl10 deficiency model served in a proof-of-principle study to test for alterations in protein patterns in response to oxidative stress.

Methods: Protein extracts of LCLs from patients, relatives and controls, as well as diploid yeast cells hemizygous for rpl10, were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and differentially regulated spots were identified by mass spectrometry. Subsequently, Gene Ontology database (GO)-term enrichment and network analysis was performed to map the identified proteins into cellular pathways.

Results: The protein signature generated by RPL10[H213Q] is a functionally related subset of the ASD-specific protein signature, sharing redox-sensitive elements in energy-, protein- and redox- metabolism. In yeast, rpl10 deficiency generates a specific protein signature, harboring components of pathways identified in both the RPL10 [ H213Q] subjects' and the ASD patients' set. Importantly, the rpl10 deficiency signature is a subset of the signature resulting from response of wild-type yeast to oxidative stress.

Conclusions: Redox-sensitive protein signatures mapping into cellular pathways with pathophysiology in ASD have been identified in both LCLs carrying the ASD-specific mutation RPL10[H213Q] and LCLs from ASD patients without this mutation. At pathway levels, this redox- sensitive protein signature has also been identified in a yeast rpl10 deficiency and an oxidative stress model. These observations point to a common molecular pathomechanism in ASD, characterized in our study by dysregulation of redox balance. Importantly, this can be triggered by the known ASD-RPL10[H213Q] mutation or by yet unknown mutations of the ASD cohort that act upstream of RPL10 in differential expression of redox-sensitive proteins.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>5 (1), 10-</Feld596><PubVol>5</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>10</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Chiocchetti AG*" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Haslinger D*" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Boesch M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Karl T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Wiemann S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Freitag CM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Poustka F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Scheibe B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Bauer JW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Hintner H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Breitenbach M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Kellermann J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Lottspeich F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Klauck SM*" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="14" name="Breitenbach-Koller L* (*=shared first/senior authership)" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24512814</PMID><DOI>10.1186/2040-2392-5-10</DOI><KST>B050</KST><KST>B063</KST><KEYWORD>COPY-NUMBER VARIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MITOCHONDRIAL DYSFUNCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SPECTRUM DISORDERS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BIOLOGICAL NETWORKS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-FUNCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DAMAGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION ANALYSES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CYTOSCAPE PLUGIN</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>47746</publishedID><Artikel>Genetic predisposition to in situ and invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast</Artikel><Journal>PloS Genetics</Journal><ABSTr>Invasive lobular breast cancer (ILC) accounts for 10-15% of all invasive breast carcinomas. It is generally ER positive (ER+) and often associated with lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). Genome-wide association studies have identified more than 70 common polymorphisms that predispose to breast cancer, but these studies included predominantly ductal (IDC) carcinomas. To identify novel common polymorphisms that predispose to ILC and LCIS, we pooled data from 6,023 cases (5,622 ILC, 401 pure LCIS) and 34,271 controls from 36 studies genotyped using the iCOGS chip. Six novel SNPs most strongly associated with ILC/LCIS in the pooled analysis were genotyped in a further 516 lobular cases (482 ILC, 36 LCIS) and 1,467 controls. These analyses identified a lobular-specific SNP at 7q34 (rs11977670, OR (95% CI) for ILC = 1.13 (1.09-1.18), P = 6.0x10(-10); P-het for ILC vs IDC ER+ tumors = 1.8x10(-4)). Of the 75 known breast cancer polymorphisms that were genotyped, 56 were associated with ILC and 15 with LCIS at P&lt;0.05. Two SNPs showed significantly stronger associations for ILC than LCIS (rs2981579/10q26/FGFR2, P-het = 0.04 and rs889312/5q11/MAP3K1, P-het = 0.03); and two showed stronger associations for LCIS than ILC (rs6678914/1q32/LGR6, P-het = 0.001 and rs1752911/6q14, P-het = 0.04). In addition, seven of the 75 known loci showed significant differences between ER+ tumors with IDC and ILC histology, three of these showing stronger associations for ILC (rs11249433/1p11, rs2981579/10q26/FGFR2 and rs10995190/10q21/ZNF365) and four associated only with IDC (5p12/rs10941679; rs2588809/14q24/RAD51L1, rs6472903/8q21 and rs1550623/2q31/CDCA7). In conclusion, we have identified one novel lobular breast cancer specific predisposition polymorphism at 7q34, and shown for the first time that common breast cancer polymorphisms predispose to LCIS. We have shown that many of the ER+ breast cancer predisposition loci also predispose to ILC, although there is some heterogeneity between ER+ lobular and ER+ IDC tumors. These data provide evidence for overlapping, but distinct etiological pathways within ER+ breast cancer between morphological subtypes.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>10 (4),

Drugs</Artikel><Journal>Molecules</Journal><ABSTr>Owing to their large size proteinaceous drugs offer higher operative information content compared to the small molecules that correspond to the traditional understanding of druglikeness. As a consequence these drugs allow developing patient-specific therapies that provide the means to go beyond the possibilities of current drug therapy. However, the efficacy of these strategies, in particular "personalized medicine", depends on precise information about individual target expression rates. Molecular imaging combines non-invasive imaging methods with tools of molecular and cellular biology and thus bridges current knowledge to the clinical use. Moreover, nuclear medicine techniques provide therapeutic applications with tracers that behave like the diagnostic tracer. The advantages of radioiodination, still the most versatile radiolabeling strategy, and other labeled compounds comprising covalently attached radioisotopes are compared to the use of chelator-protein conjugates that are complexed with metallic radioisotopes. With the techniques using radioactive isotopes as a reporting unit or even the therapeutic principle, care has to be taken to avoid cleavage of the radionuclide from the protein it is linked to. The tracers used in molecular imaging require labeling techniques that provide site specific conjugation and metabolic stability. Appropriate choice of the radionuclide allows tailoring the properties of the labeled protein to the application required. Until the event of positron emission tomography the spectrum of nuclides used to visualize cellular and biochemical processes was largely restricted to iodine isotopes and 99m-technetium.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified a number of common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with CRC risk. Although it has been shown that these CRC susceptibility SNPs only explain a small proportion of the genetic risk, it is not clear how much of the heritability these SNPs explain and how much is left to be detected by other, yet to be identified, common SNPs. Therefore, we estimated the heritability of CRC under different scenarios using Genome-Wide Complex Trait Analysis in the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium including 8025 cases and 10 814 controls. We estimated that the heritability explained by known common CRC SNPs identified in GWAS was 0.65% (95% CI:0.3-1%; P = 1.11 x 10-16), whereas the heritability explained by all common SNPs was at least 7.42% (95% CI: 4.71-10.12%; P = 8.13 x 10(-8)), suggesting that many common variants associated with CRC risk remain to be detected. Comparing the heritability explained by the common variants with that from twin and family studies, a fraction of the heritability may be explained by other genetic variants, such as rare variants. In addition, our analysis showed that the gene x smoking interaction explained a significant proportion of the CRC variance (P = 1.26 x 10(-2)). In summary, our results suggest that known CRC SNPs only explain a small proportion of the heritability and more common SNPs have yet to be identified</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (14), 3898-3905</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>14</PubIss><StrtPage>3898</StrtPage><EndPage>3905</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Jiao S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Peters U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Berndt S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Butterbach K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Caan BJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Carlson CS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Chan AT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Chang-Claude J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Chanock S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Curtis KR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Duggan D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Gong J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Harrison TA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Hayes RB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Henderson BE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Hoffmeister M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="17" name="Kolonel LN" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Le Marchand L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Potter JD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Prentice RL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Rudolph A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Schoen RE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Seminara D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Slattery L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="White E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Hsu L" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24562164</PMID><DOI>10.1093/hmg/ddu087</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLON-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DESIGN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEALTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>susceptibility loci</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PANCREATIC-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK LOCI</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMMON SNPS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN HEIGHT</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>47898</publishedID><Artikel>Assessing risk prediction models using individual participant data from multiple studies</Artikel><Journal>American Journal of Epidemiology</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>179 (5), 621-632</Feld596><PubVol>179</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>621</StrtPage><EndPage>632</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Pennells L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Kaptoge S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="White IR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Thompson SG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Wood AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration*. *Authors on behalf of the ESTHER study" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name=": Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Schöttker B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Mueller H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24366051</PMID><DOI>10.1093/aje/kwt298</DOI><KST>C070</KST></row><row><publishedID>47905</publishedID><Artikel>Childhood cancer survival in Europe 1999-2007: results of EUROCARE-5 - a population-based study</Artikel><Journal>Lancet Oncology</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>15 (1), 35-47</Feld596><PubVol>15</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>35</StrtPage><EndPage>47</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Gatta G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Botta L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Rossi S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Aareleid T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Bielska-Lasota M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Clavel J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Dimitrova N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Jakab Z" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Kaatsch P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Lacour B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Mallone S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Marcos-Gragera R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Minicozzi P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Sánchez-Pérez MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Sant M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Santaquilani M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Stiller C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Tavilla A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Trama A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Visser O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Peris-Bonet R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="EUROCARE Working Group*" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="*Authors from Germany" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name=": Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="24" name="Kaatsch P" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24314616</PMID><DOI>10.1016/S1470-2045(13)70548-5</DOI><KST>C070</KST></row><row><publishedID>47922</publishedID><Artikel>Socioeconomic and country variations in cross-border cigarette purchasing as tobacco tax avoidance strategy. Findings from the ITC Europe Surveys</Artikel><Journal>Tobacco Control</Journal><ABSTr>Background
Legal tobacco tax avoidance strategies such as cross-border cigarette purchasing may attenuate the impact of tax increases on tobacco consumption. Little is known about socioeconomic and country variations in cross-border purchasing.
Objective
To describe socioeconomic and country variations in cross-border cigarette purchasing in six European countries.
Methods
Cross-sectional data from adult smokers (n=7873) from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Surveys in France (2006/2007), Germany (2007), Ireland (2006), The Netherlands (2008), Scotland (2006) and the rest of the UK (2007/2008) were used. Respondents were asked whether they had bought cigarettes outside their country in the last 6 months and how often.
Findings
In French and German provinces/states bordering countries with lower cigarette prices, 24% and 13% of smokers, respectively, reported purchasing cigarettes frequently outside their country. In non-border regions of France and Germany, and in Ireland, Scotland, the rest of the UK and The Netherlands, frequent purchasing of cigarettes outside the country was reported by 2-7% of smokers. Smokers with higher levels of education or income, younger smokers, daily smokers, heavier smokers and smokers not planning to quit smoking were more likely to purchase cigarettes outside their country.
Conclusions
Cross-border cigarette purchasing is more common in European regions bordering countries with lower cigarette prices and is more often reported by smokers with higher education and income. Increasing taxes in countries with lower cigarette prices, and reducing the number of cigarettes that can be legally imported across borders could help to avoid cross-border purchasing.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (Suppl. 1), i30-i38</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>Suppl. 1</PubIss><StrtPage>i30</StrtPage><EndPage>i38</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Nagelhout GE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="van den Putte B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Allwright S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Mons U" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="McNeill A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Guignard R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Beck F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Siahpush M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Joossens L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Fong GT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="de Vries H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Willemsen MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>23644287</PMID><DOI>10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2012-05</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>PRICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CESSATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEALTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>smoking</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>47925</publishedID><Artikel>A reverse J-shaped association of leisure time physical activity with prognosis in patients with stable coronary heart disease: evidence from a large cohort with repeated measurements</Artikel><Journal>Heart</Journal><ABSTr>Objective To study the association of self-reported physical activity level with prognosis in a cohort of patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), with a special focus on the dose-response relationship with different levels of physical activity.

Methods Data were drawn from a prospective cohort of 1038 subjects with stable CHD in which frequency of strenuous leisure time physical activity was assessed repeatedly over 10 years of follow-up. Multiple Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the association of physical activity level with different outcomes of prognosis (major cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality), with different sets of adjustments for potential confounders and taking into account time-dependence of frequency of physical activity.

Results A decline in engagement in physical activity over follow-up was observed. For all outcomes, the highest hazards were consistently found in the least active patient group, with a roughly twofold risk for major cardiovascular events and a roughly fourfold risk for both cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in comparison to the reference group of moderately frequent active patients. Furthermore, when taking time-dependence of physical activity into account, our data indicated reverse J-shaped associations of physical activity level with cardiovascular mortality, with the most frequently active patients also having increased hazards (2.36, 95% CI 1.05 to 5.34).

Conclusions This study substantiated previous findings on the increased risks for adverse outcomes in physically inactive CHD patients. In addition, we also found evidence of increased cardiovascular mortality in patients with daily strenuous physical activity, which warrants further investigation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>100 (13), 1043-1049</Feld596><PubVol>100</PubVol><PubIss>13</PubIss><StrtPage>1043</StrtPage><EndPage>1049</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Mons U" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Hahmann H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24829374</PMID><DOI>10.1136/heartjnl-2013-305242</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>MEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FOLLOW-UP</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MORTALITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SMOKING-CESSATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AMERICAN-COLLEGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>exercise</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>rehabilitation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METAANALYSIS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>47950</publishedID><Artikel>Association between tobacco control policy awareness, social acceptability of smoking and smoking cessation.

The approach is based on DECT images converted to electron density relative to water varrhoe/varrhoe, w and effective atomic number Zeff. To establish a parameterization of the I-value by Zeff, 71 tabulated tissue compositions were used. For the experimental assessment of the method we scanned 20 materials (tissue surrogates, polymers, aluminum, titanium) at 80/140Sn kVp and 100/140Sn kVp (Sn: additional tin filtration) and computed the varrhoe/varrhoe, w and Zeff with a purely image based algorithm. Thereby, we found that varrhoe/varrhoe, w (Zeff) could be determined with an accuracy of 0.4% (1.7%) for the tissue surrogates with known elemental compositions. SPRs were predicted from DECT images for all 20 materials using the presented approach and were compared to measured water-equivalent path lengths (closely related to SPR). For the tissue surrogates the presented DECT approach was found to predict the experimental values within 0.6%, for aluminum and titanium within an accuracy of 1.7% and 9.4% (from 16-bit reconstructed DECT images).</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>59 (1), 83-96</Feld596><PubVol>59</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>83</StrtPage><EndPage>96</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Huenemohr N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Krauss B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Tremmel C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Ackermann B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Jaekel O" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Greilich S" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24334601</PMID><DOI>10.1088/0031-9155/59/1/83</DOI><KST>E040</KST><KEYWORD>radiation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>segmentation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MONTE-CARLO SIMULATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RANGE UNCERTAINTIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SPATIAL-RESOLUTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ATOMIC NUMBERS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SCANNER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>radiography</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DOSE CALCULATIONS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>47966</publishedID><Artikel>BRAF V600E mutation is associated with mTOR signaling activation in glioneuronal tumors</Artikel><Journal>Brain Pathology</Journal><ABSTr>BRAF V600E mutations have been recently reported in glioneuronal tumors (GNTs). To evaluate the expression of the BRAF V600E mutated protein and its association with activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, immunophenotype and clinical characteristics in GNTs, we investigated a cohort of 174 GNTs. The presence of BRAF V600E mutations was detected by direct DNA sequencing and BRAF V600E immunohistochemical detection. Expression of BRAF-mutated protein was detected in 38/93 (40.8%) gangliogliomas (GGs), 2/4 (50%) desmoplastic infantile gangliogliomas (DIGs) and 23/77 (29.8%) dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNTs) by immunohistochemistry. In both GGs and DNTs, the presence of BRAF V600E mutation was significantly associated with the expression of CD34, phosphorylated ribosomal S6 protein (pS6; marker of mTOR pathway activation) in dysplastic neurons and synaptophysin (P &lt; 0.05). In GGs, the presence of lymphocytic cuffs was more frequent in BRAF-mutated cases (31 vs. 15.8%; P=0.001). The expression of both BRAF V600E and pS6 was associated with a worse postoperative seizure outcome in GNT (P &lt; 0.001). Immunohistochemical detection of BRAF V600E-mutated protein may be valuable in the diagnostic evaluation of these glioneuronal lesions and the observed association with mTOR activation may aid in the development of targeted treatment involving specific pathogenic pathways.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>24 (1), 52-66</Feld596><PubVol>24</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>52</StrtPage><EndPage>66</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Prabowo AS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Iyer AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Veersema TJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Anink JJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schouten-van Meeteren AY" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Spliet WG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="van Rijen PC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Ferrier CH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Capper D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Thom M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Aronica E" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>23941441</PMID><DOI>10.1111/bpa.12081</DOI><KST>G380</KST><KEYWORD>TUBEROUS SCLEROSIS COMPLEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MAMMALIAN TARGET</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FOCAL CORTICAL DYSPLASIAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHRONIC INTRACTABLE EPILEPSY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONSENSUS CLASSIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIAGNOSTIC METHODS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BALLOON CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TASK-FORCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>beta-catenin</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHWAY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>47973</publishedID><Artikel>Quantitative Volumetric CT-Histogram analysis in N-staging of 18F-FDG-equivocal patients with lung cancer</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Nuclear Medicine</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>55 (4), 559-564</Feld596><PubVol>55</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>559</StrtPage><EndPage>564</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Flechsig,P."

We investigated the tissue kinetics of a small molecule inhibitor of PSMA ((S)-2-(3-((S)-1-carboxy-5-(3-(4-[I-124]iodophenyl)ureido)pentyl)ureido)pentanedioicacid; MIP-1095) using PET/CT to estimate radiation dosimetry for the potential therapeutic use of I-131-MIP-1095 in men with mCRPC. We also report preliminary safety and efficacy of the first 28 consecutive patients treated under a compassionate-use protocol with a single cycle of I-131-MIP-1095.

Methods Sixteen patients with known prostate cancer underwent PET/CT imaging after i.v. administration of I-124-MIP-1095 (mean activity: 67.4 MBq). Each patient was scanned using PET/CT up to five times at 1, 4, 24, 48 and 72 h post injection. Volumes of interest were defined for tumor lesions and normal organs at each time point followed by dose calculations using the OLINDA/EXM software. Twenty-eight men with mCRPC were treated with a single cycle of I-131-MIP-1095 (mean activity: 4.8 GBq, range 2 to 7.2 GBq) and followed for safety and efficacy. Baseline and follow up examinations included a complete blood count, liver and kidney function tests, and measurement of serum PSA.

Results I-124-MIP-1095 PET/CT images showed excellent tumor uptake and moderate uptake in liver, proximal intestine and within a few hours post-injection also in the kidneys. High uptake values were observed only in salivary and lacrimal glands. Dosimetry estimates for I-131-MIP-1095 revealed that the highest absorbed doses were delivered to the salivary glands (3.8 mSv/MBq, liver (1.7 mSv/MBq) and kidneys (1.4 mSv/MBq). The absorbed dose calculated for the red marrow was 0.37 mSv/MBq. PSA values decreased by &gt; 50 % in 60.7 % of the men treated. Of men with bone pain, 84.6 % showed complete or moderate reduction in pain. Hematological toxicities were mild. Of men treated, 25 % had a transient slight to moderate dry mouth. No adverse effects on renal function were observed.

Conclusion Based on the biodistribution and dose calculations of the PSMA-targeted small molecule I-124-MIP-1095 therapy with the authentic analog I-131-MIP-1095 enables a targeted tumor therapy with unprecedented doses delivered to the tumor lesions. Involved lymph node and bone metastases were exposed to estimated absorbed doses upwards of 300 Gy.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>41 (7), 1280-1292</Feld596><PubVol>41</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>1280</StrtPage><EndPage>1292</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Zechmann,C.M."

A plethora of distinct and differently sized LDs was detected by a brief application of adipocyte differentiation medium and additional short treatment with oleic acid. Using these cells and highly specific antibodies for LD-binding proteins of the perilipin (PLIN) family, we could distinguish between endogenously derived LDs (endogenous LDs) positive for perilipin from exogenously induced LDs (exogenous LDs) positive for adipophilin, TIP47 and S3-12. Having optimized these stimulation conditions, we used early adipogenic differentiation stages to investigate small-sized LDs and concentrated on LD-protein associations with the intermediate-sized filament (IF) vimentin. This IF protein was described earlier to surround lipid globules, showing spherical, cage-like structures. Consequently - by biochemical methods, by immunofluorescence microscopy and by electron- and immunoelectron microscopy - various stages of emerging lipid globules were revealed with perilipin as linking protein between LDs and vimentin. For this LD-PLIN-Vimentin connection, a model is now proposed, suggesting an interaction of proteins via opposed charged amino acid domains respectively. In addition, multiple sheaths of smooth endoplasmic reticulum cisternae surrounding concentrically nascent LDs are shown. Based on our comprehensive localization studies we present and discuss a novel pathway for the LD formation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (2), e90386-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>e90386</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Heid,H."

TAK-779 displays high affinity and selectivity for the CCR5 receptor and serves as a lead compound for the development of further antagonists. In order to increase the oral bioavailability replacement of the quaternary ammonium structure by a tertiary amine and modification of the 4-methylphenyl moiety were envisaged. Herein, a new synthetic strategy for the development of TAK-779 analogs by late stage diversification is reported. The Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions allowed various modifications of the central amide building block 3 at the end of the synthesis leading to compounds 2f and 2h with a promising CCR5 binding affinity.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>12 (1), 177-186</Feld596><PubVol>12</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>177</StrtPage><EndPage>186</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Junker A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Schepmann D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Yamaguchi J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Itami K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Faust A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Kopka K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Wagner S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Wunsch B" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24217712</PMID><DOI>10.1039/c3ob41873a</DOI><KST>E030</KST><KEYWORD>HIV</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANTAGONISTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POTENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHEMOKINE RECEPTOR CCR5</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AMIDE BOND FORMATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANTI-HIV-1 AGENTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HALOTHIOPHENES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DERIVATIVES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INFECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>47999</publishedID><Artikel>Adherence to predefined dietary patterns and incident type 2 diabetes in European populations: EPIC-InterAct Study</Artikel><Journal>Diabetologia</Journal><ABSTr>AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Few studies have investigated the relationship between predefined dietary patterns and type 2 diabetes incidence; little is known about the generalisability of these associations. We aimed to assess the association between predefined dietary patterns and type 2 diabetes risk in European populations. METHODS: From among a case-cohort of 12,403 incident diabetes cases and 16,154 subcohort members nested within the prospective European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study, we used data on 9,682 cases and 12,595 subcohort participants from seven countries. Habitual dietary intake was assessed at baseline with country-specific dietary questionnaires. Two diet-quality scores (alternative Healthy Eating Index [aHEI], Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension [DASH] score) and three reduced rank regression (RRR)-derived dietary-pattern scores were constructed. Country-specific HRs were calculated and combined using a random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: After multivariable adjustment, including body size, the aHEI and DASH scores were not significantly associated with diabetes, although for the aHEI there was a tendency towards an inverse association in countries with higher mean age. We observed inverse associations of the three RRR-derived dietary-pattern scores with diabetes: HRs (95% CIs) for a 1-SD difference were 0.91 (0.86, 0.96), 0.92 (0.84, 1.01) and 0.87 (0.82, 0.92). Random-effects meta-analyses revealed heterogeneity between countries that was explainable by differences in the age of participants or the distribution of dietary intake. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Adherence to specific RRR-derived dietary patterns, commonly characterised by high intake of fruits or vegetables and low intake of processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages and refined grains, may lower type 2 diabetes risk.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>57 (2), 321-333</Feld596><PubVol>57</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>321</StrtPage><EndPage>333</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kroeger,J."

Mutations in the gene encoding Nogo-A or abnormalities in Nogo-A expression are linked to neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. The present study assesses the impact of constitutively reduced expression of Nogo-A on place navigation in a novel transgenic rat model. Two spatial paradigms were used: (1) A battery of tests in the Carousel maze requiring continuous processing of spatial information with increasing demands for the segregation of reference frames and behavioral flexibility and (2) a delayed-matching-to-place version of the Morris water maze (MWM), which requires place navigation and is sensitive to deficits in one-trial-encoded place representation. The Carousel maze testing revealed a subtle but significant impairment in management of reference frames. Matching-to-place learning in the Morris water maze was unaffected, suggesting an intact representation of an unmarked goal. Our results show that Nogo-A deficiency leads to cognitive deficit in processing of the reference frames. Such a deficit may be the result of neuro-developmental alterations resulting from Nogo-A deficiency.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>107 (), 42-49</Feld596><PubVol>107</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>42</StrtPage><EndPage>49</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Petrasek T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Prokopova I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bahnik S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schonig K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Berger S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Vales K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Tews B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Schwab ME" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Bartsch D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Stuchlik A" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24211256</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.nlm.2013.10.015</DOI><KST>V077</KST><KEYWORD>synaptic plasticity</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SCHIZOPHRENIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MESSENGER-RNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEURITE GROWTH-INHIBITORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANTI-NOGO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COGNITIVE COORDINATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BEHAVIORAL EVIDENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MICE LACKING</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48003</publishedID><Artikel>The genetic landscape of clinical resistance to RAF inhibition in metastatic melanoma</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Discovery</Journal><ABSTr>Most patients with BRAF(V600)-mutant metastatic melanoma develop resistance to selective RAF kinase inhibitors. The spectrum of clinical genetic resistance mechanisms to RAF inhibitors and options for salvage therapy are incompletely understood. We performed whole-exome sequencing on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors from 45 patients with BRAF(V600)-mutant metastatic melanoma who received vemurafenib or dabrafenib monotherapy. Genetic alterations in known or putative RAF inhibitor resistance genes were observed in 23 of 45 patients (51%). Besides previously characterized alterations, we discovered a "long tail" of new mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway alterations (MAP2K2, MITF) that confer RAF inhibitor resistance. In three cases, multiple resistance gene alterations were observed within the same tumor biopsy. Overall, RAF inhibitor therapy leads to diverse clinical genetic resistance mechanisms, mostly involving MAPK pathway reactivation. Novel therapeutic combinations may be needed to achieve durable clinical control of BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma. Integrating clinical genomics with preclinical screens may model subsequent resistance studies.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>4 (1), 94-109</Feld596><PubVol>4</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>94</StrtPage><EndPage>109</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Van Allen EM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Wagle N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Sucker A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Treacy DJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Johannessen CM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Goetz EM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Place CS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Taylor-Weiner A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Whittaker S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Kryukov GV" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Hodis E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Rosenberg M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="McKenna A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Cibulskis K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Farlow D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Zimmer L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="16" name="Hillen U" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="17" name="Gutzmer R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Goldinger SM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Ugurel S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Gogas HJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Egberts F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Berking C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="23" name="Trefzer U" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="24" name="Loquai C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="25" name="Weide B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="26" name="Hassel JC" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="27" name="Gabriel SB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Carter SL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Getz G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Garraway LA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Schadendorf D" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24265153</PMID><KST>L201</KST><KST>L401</KST><KST>L501</KST><KST>L701</KST><KST>L801</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>ACQUIRED-RESISTANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BRAF</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MEK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SEQUENCING DATA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VEMURAFENIB</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER GENOME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>tumor</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REVEALS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48012</publishedID><Artikel>CYP2D6 Genotype and Adjuvant Tamoxifen: Meta-Analysis of Heterogeneous Study Populations</Artikel><Journal>Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics</Journal><ABSTr>The International Tamoxifen Pharmacogenomics Consortium was established to address the controversy regarding cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) status and clinical outcomes in tamoxifen therapy.

Using strict eligibility requirements (postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, receiving 20 mg/day tamoxifen for 5 years, criterion 1); CYP2D6 poor metabolizer status was associated with poorer invasive disease-free survival (IDFS: hazard ratio = 1.25; 95% confidence interval = 1.06, 1.47; P = 0.009).

Although investigators widely recognize that family history will be associated with genotypes of the participants at disease susceptibility loci, they commonly ignore such information in primary genetic association analyses. In this report, we propose a simple approach to association testing by incorporating family history information as a "phenotype." We account for the expected attenuation in strength of association of the genotype of study participants with family history under Mendelian transmission. The proposed analysis can be performed using standard statistical software adopting either a meta- or pooled-analysis framework. Re-analysis of a total of 115 known susceptibility single-nucleotide polymorphisms, discovered through genome-wide association studies for several disease traits, indicates that incorporation of family history information can increase efficiency by as much as 40%. Efficiency gain depends on the type of design used for conducting the primary study, extent of family history, and accuracy and completeness of reporting.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>38 (2), 114-122</Feld596><PubVol>38</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>114</StrtPage><EndPage>122</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ghosh A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Hartge P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kraft P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Joshi AD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Ziegler RG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Barrdahl M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Chanock SJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Wacholder S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Chatterjee N" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24408355</PMID><DOI>10.1002/gepi.21785</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>NURSES HEALTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMMON DISEASES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LINE CHARACTERISTICS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RARE VARIANTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COHORT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROSTATE-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIFE-STYLE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48098</publishedID><Artikel>Mast cells play no role in the pathogenesis of postoperative ileus induced by intestinal manipulation</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>INTRODUCTION: Intestinal manipulation (IM) during abdominal surgery results in intestinal inflammation leading to hypomotility or ileus. Mast cell activation is thought to play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of postoperative ileus (POI). However, this conclusion was mainly drawn using mast cell-deficient mouse models with abnormal Kit signaling. These mice also lack interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) resulting in aberrant gastrointestinal motility even prior to surgery, compromising their use as model to study POI. To avoid these experimental weaknesses we took advantage of a newly developed knock-in mouse model, Cpa3(Cre/+) , devoid of mast cells but with intact Kit signaling. DESIGN: The role of mast cells in the development of POI and intestinal inflammation was evaluated assessing gastrointestinal transit and muscularis externa inflammation after IM in two strains of mice lacking mast cells, i.e. Kit(W-sh/W-sh) and Cpa3(Cre/+) mice, and by use of the mast cell stabilizer cromolyn. RESULTS: Kit(W-sh/W-sh) mice lack ICC networks and already revealed significantly delayed gastrointestinal transit even before surgery. IM did not further delay intestinal transit, but induced infiltration of myeloperoxidase positive cells, expression of inflammatory cytokines and recruitment of monocytes and neutrophils into the muscularis externa. On the contrary, Cpa3(Cre/+) mice have a normal network of ICC and normal gastrointestinal. Surprisingly, IM in Cpa3(Cre/+) mice caused delay in gut motility and intestinal inflammation as in wild type littermates mice (Cpa3(+/+) ). Furthermore, treatment with the mast cell inhibitor cromolyn resulted in an inhibition of mast cells without preventing POI. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we confirm that IM induced mast cell degranulation. However, our data demonstrate that mast cells are not required for the pathogenesis of POI in mice. Although there might be species differences between mouse and human, our results argue against mast cell inhibitors as a therapeutic approach to shorten POI.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (1), e85304-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>e85304</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Gomez-Pinilla PJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Farro G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Di Giovangiulio M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Stakenborg N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Nemethova A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="de Vries A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Liston A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Feyerabend TB" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Rodewald HR" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Boeckxstaens GE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Matteoli G" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24416383</PMID><KST>D110</KST><KEYWORD>INTERSTITIAL-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STIMULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SH MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMPOUND-48/80</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>KETOTIFEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CAJAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DEGRANULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>inflammation</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48102</publishedID><Artikel>Counseling patients on cancer diets: a review of the literature and recommendations for clinical practice</Artikel><Journal>Anticancer Research</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Many cancer patients use cancer diets. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We listed 13 cancer diets simulating an internet search for which we systematically reviewed clinical data. In the next step we derived recommendations on counseling patients using a Delphi process. RESULTS: We evaluated the following diets: raw vegetables and fruits, alkaline diet, macrobiotics, Gerson's regime, Budwig's and low carbohydrate or ketogenic diet. We did not find clinical evidence supporting any of the diets. Furthermore, case reports and pre-clinical data point to the potential harm of some of these diets. From published recommendations on counseling on complementary and alternative medicine, we were able to derive 14 recommendations for counseling on cancer diets. CONCLUSION: Considering the lack of evidence of benefits from cancer diets and potential harm by malnutrition, oncologists should engage more in counseling cancer patients on such diets. Our recommendations could be helpful in this process.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>34 (1), 39-48</Feld596><PubVol>34</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>39</StrtPage><EndPage>48</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Huebner J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Marienfeld S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Abbenhardt C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Ulrich CM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Muenstedt K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Micke O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Muecke R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Loeser C" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24403443</PMID><KST>G110</KST><KEYWORD>LIFE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>hypothesis</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CAM USE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>KETOGENIC DIET</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METABOLISM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>chemotherapy</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48109</publishedID><Artikel>State-of-the-art aortic imaging: Part II - applications in transcatheter aortic valve replacement and endovascular aortic aneurysm repair</Artikel><Journal>VASA</Journal><ABSTr>Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) as well as thoracic and abdominal endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR and EVAR) rely on accurate pre- and postprocedural imaging. This review article discusses the application of imaging, including preprocedural assessment and measurements as well as postprocedural imaging of complications. Furthermore, the exciting perspective of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based on cross-sectional imaging is presented. TAVR is a minimally invasive alternative for treatment of aortic valve stenosis in patients with high age and multiple comorbidities who cannot undergo traditional open surgical repair. Given the lack of direct visualization during the procedure, pre- and peri-procedural imaging forms an essential part of the intervention. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is the imaging modality of choice for preprocedural planning. Routine postprocedural follow-up is performed by echocardiography to confirm treatment success and detect complications. EVAR and TEVAR are minimally invasive alternatives to open surgical repair of aortic pathologies. CTA constitutes the preferred imaging modality for both preoperative planning and postoperative follow-up including detection of endoleaks. Magnetic resonance imaging is an excellent alternative to CT for postoperative follow-up, and is especially beneficial for younger patients given the lack of radiation. Ultrasound is applied in screening and postoperative follow-up of abdominal aortic aneurysms, but cross-sectional imaging is required once abnormalities are detected. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound may be as sensitive as CTA in detecting endoleaks.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>43 (1), 6-26</Feld596><PubVol>43</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>6</StrtPage><EndPage>26</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Rengier F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Geisbusch P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Schoenhagen P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Mueller-Eschner M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Vosshenrich R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Karmonik C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="von Tengg-Kobligk H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Partovi S" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24429327</PMID><DOI>10.1024/0301-1526/a000324</DOI><KST>E010</KST><KEYWORD>MAGNETIC-RESONANCE ANGIOGRAPHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SEMIAUTOMATIC CENTERLINE ANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMPUTATIONAL FLUID-DYNAMICS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CARDIOVASCULAR-INTERVENTIONS EAPCI</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPANDING COREVALVE PROSTHESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CARDIOTHORACIC-SURGERY EACTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPERT CONSENSUS DOCUMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RADIATION-DOSE REDUCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LOW TUBE VOLTAGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MULTISLICE COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48112</publishedID><Artikel>Cohesin and CTCF differentially affect chromatin architecture and gene expression in human cells</Artikel><Journal>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</Journal><ABSTr>Recent studies of genome-wide chromatin interactions have revealed that the human genome is partitioned into many self-associating topological domains. The boundary sequences between domains are enriched for binding sites of CTCC-binding factor (CTCF) and the cohesin complex, implicating these two factors in the establishment or maintenance of topological domains. To determine the role of cohesin and CTCF in higher-order chromatin architecture in human cells, we depleted the cohesin complex or CTCF and examined the consequences of loss of these factors on higher-order chromatin organization, as well as the transcriptome. We observed a general loss of local chromatin interactions upon disruption of cohesin, but the topological domains remain intact. However, we found that depletion of CTCF not only reduced intradomain interactions but also increased interdomain interactions. Furthermore, distinct groups of genes become misregulated upon depletion of cohesin and CTCF. Taken together, these observations suggest that CTCF and cohesin contribute differentially to chromatin organization and gene regulation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>111 (3), 996-1001</Feld596><PubVol>111</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>996</StrtPage><EndPage>1001</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Zuin J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Dixon JR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="van der Reijden MI" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Ye Z" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kolovos P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Brouwer RW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="van de Corput MP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="van de Werken HJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Knoch TA" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="van Ijcken WF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Grosveld FG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Ren B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Wendt KS" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24335803</PMID><DOI>10.1073/pnas.1317788111</DOI><KST>B066</KST><KEYWORD>CONFORMATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SEPARATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TOPOLOGICAL DOMAINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MAMMALIAN GENOMES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BETA-GLOBIN LOCUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ORGANIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CLEAVAGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BINDING</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48129</publishedID><Artikel>Weight change later in life and colon and rectal cancer risk in participants in the EPIC-PANACEA study</Artikel><Journal>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: A moderate association exists between body mass index (BMI) and colorectal cancer. Less is known about the effect of weight change. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the relation between BMI and weight change and subsequent colon and rectal cancer risk. DESIGN: This was studied among 328,781 participants in the prospective European Prospective Investigation into Cancer-Physical Activity, Nutrition, Alcohol, Cessation of Smoking, Eating study (mean age: 50 y). Body weight was assessed at recruitment and on average 5 y later. Self-reported weight change (kg/y) was categorized in sex-specific quintiles, with quintiles 2 and 3 combined as the reference category (men: -0.6 to 0.3 kg/y; women: -0.4 to 0.4 kg/y). In the subsequent years, participants were followed for the occurrence of colon and rectal cancer (median period: 6.8 y). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were used to study the association. RESULTS: A total of 1261 incident colon cancer and 747 rectal cancer cases were identified. BMI at recruitment was statistically significantly associated with colon cancer risk in men (HR: 1.04; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.07). Moderate weight gain (quintile 4) in men increased risk further (HR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.68), but this relation did not show a clear trend. In women, BMI or weight gain was not related to subsequent risk of colon cancer. No statistically significant associations for weight loss and colon cancer or for BMI and weight changes and rectal cancer were found. CONCLUSIONS: BMI attained at adulthood was associated with colon cancer risk. Subsequent weight gain or loss was not related to colon or rectal cancer risk in men or women.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>99 (1), 139-147</Feld596><PubVol>99</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>139</StrtPage><EndPage>147</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Steins Bisschop CN" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="van Gils CH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Emaus MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Monninkhof EM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Aleksandrova K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Jenab M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Norat T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Boutron-Rualt MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Fagherazzi G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Racine A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Palli D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Krogh V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Naccarati A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Mattiello A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Arguelles MV" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Sanchez MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Tormo MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Ardanaz E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Dorronsoro M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Bonet C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Key T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Orfanos P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Naska A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Kaaks RR" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="30" name="Lukanova A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="31" name="Pischon T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Ljuslinder I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Jirstrom K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Ohlsson B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Landsvig Berentzen T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Halkjaer J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Skeie G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Braaten T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Siersema PD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Freisling H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="44" name="Ferrari P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="45" name="Peeters PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="46" name="May AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24225355</PMID><DOI>10.3945/ajcn.113.066530</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>COHORT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEALTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OBESITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>nutrition</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMPETING RISKS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BODY-MASS INDEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SIZE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REGRESSION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48130</publishedID><Artikel>Dietary intakes and risk of lymphoid and myeloid leukemia in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)</Artikel><Journal>Nutrition and Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>The etiology of leukemias cannot entirely be explained by known risk factors, including ionizing radiation, benzene exposure, and infection with human T cell leukemia virus. A number of studies suggested that diet influences the risk of adult leukemias. However, results have been largely inconsistent. We examined the potential association between dietary factors and risk of leukemias among participants of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study. Among the 477,325 participants with mean follow-up of 11.34 yr (SD = 2.47), 773 leukemias (373 and 342 cases of lymphoid and myeloid leukemia, respectively) were identified. Diet over the previous 12 mo was assessed at baseline using a validated country-specific dietary questionnaire. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to explore the association between dietary factors that have previously been associated with leukemia risk, including red and processed meat, poultry, offal, fish, dairy products, vegetables, fruits, and seeds/nuts, and risk of both lymphoid and myeloid leukemias. No significant associations were observed between dietary measures and total, lymphoid, and myeloid leukemias. Additional subtype analyses showed no dietary association with risk of major subtypes of leukemias. In summary, this study did not support a possible link between selected dietary factors and risk of leukemias.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>66 (1), 14-28</Feld596><PubVol>66</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>14</StrtPage><EndPage>28</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Saberi Hosnijeh F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Peeters P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Romieu I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kelly R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Olsen A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Fagherazzi G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Clavel-Chapelon F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Dossus L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Nieters A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Teucher B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Naska A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Valanou E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Mattiello A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Sieri S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Parr CL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Engeset D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Skeie G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Dorronsoro M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Barricarte A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Sanchez MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Ericson U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Sonestedt E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Ros MM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Travis RC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Key TJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Vineis P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Vermeulen R" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24279598</PMID><DOI>10.1080/01635581.2014.847471</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>VITAMIN-D</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NON-HODGKIN-LYMPHOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANADA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>meat</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIFE-STYLE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CALIBRATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONSUMPTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEALTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POLYMORPHISMS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48178</publishedID><Artikel>Peptides derived from human galectin-3 N-terminal tail interact with its carbohydrate recognition domain in a phosphorylation-dependent manner</Artikel><Journal>Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications</Journal><ABSTr>Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is a multi-functional effector protein that functions in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, as well as extracellularly following non-classical secretion. Structurally, Gal-3 is unique among galectins with its carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) attached to a rather long N-terminal tail composed mostly of collagen-like repeats (nine in the human protein) and terminating in a short non-collagenous terminal peptide sequence unique in this lectin family and not yet fully explored. Although several Ser and Tyr sites within the N-terminal tail can be phosphorylated, the physiological significance of this post-translational modification remains unclear. Here, we used a series of synthetic (phospho)peptides derived from the tail to assess phosphorylation-mediated interactions with (15)N-labeled Gal-3 CRD. HSQC-derived chemical shift perturbations revealed selective interactions at the backface of the CRD that were attenuated by phosphorylation of Tyr 107 and Tyr 118, while phosphorylation of Ser 6 and Ser 12 was essential. Controls with sequence scrambling underscored inherent specificity. Our studies shed light on how phosphorylation of the N-terminal tail may impact on Gal-3 function and prompt further studies using phosphorylated full-length protein.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>443 (1), 126-131</Feld596><PubVol>443</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>126</StrtPage><EndPage>131</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Berbis MA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Andre S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Canada FJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Pipkorn R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Ippel H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Mayo KH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Kuebler D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Gabius HJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Jimenez-Barbero J" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24269589</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.bbrc.2013.11.063</DOI><KST>A060</KST><KST>D015</KST><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LECTIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POLYPEPTIDE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BINDING PROTEIN-35</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NUCLEAR EXPORT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>secretion</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUGAR CODE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48179</publishedID><Artikel>Development of a highly sensitive and specific method for detection of circulating tumor cells harboring somatic mutations in non-small-cell lung cancer patients</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Oncogenic mutations are powerful predictive biomarkers for molecularly targeted cancer therapies. For mutation detection patients have to undergo invasive tumor biopsies. Alternatively, archival samples are used which may no longer reflect the actual tumor status. Circulating tumor cells (CTC) could serve as an alternative platform to detect somatic mutations in cancer patients. We sought to develop a sensitive and specific assay to detect mutations in the EGFR gene in CTC from lung cancer patients. METHODS: We developed a novel assay based on real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and melting curve analysis to detect activating EGFR mutations in blood cell fractions enriched in CTC. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was chosen as disease model with reportedly very low CTC counts. The assay was prospectively validated in samples from patients with EGFR-mutant and EGFR-wild type NSCLC treated within a randomized clinical trial. Sequential analyses were conducted to monitor CTC signals during therapy and correlate mutation detection in CTC with treatment outcome. RESULTS: Assay sensitivity was optimized to enable detection of a single EGFR-mutant CTC/mL peripheral blood. CTC were detected in pretreatment blood samples from all 8 EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients studied. Loss of EGFR-mutant CTC signals correlated with treatment response, and its reoccurrence preceded relapse. CONCLUSIONS: Despite low abundance of CTC in NSCLC oncogenic mutations can be reproducibly detected by applying an unbiased CTC enrichment strategy and highly sensitive PCR and melting curve analysis. This strategy may enable non-invasive, specific biomarker diagnostics and monitoring in patients undergoing targeted cancer therapies.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (1), e85350-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>e85350</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Breitenbuecher F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Hoffarth S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Worm K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Cortes-Incio D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Gauler TC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Kohler J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Herold T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Kurt Werner S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Freitag L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Kasper S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Schuler M" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24465542</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0085350</DOI><KST>L401</KST><KEYWORD>EGFR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GEFITINIB</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>erlotinib</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METASTATIC COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RARE MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RESISTANT PROSTATE-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGNOSTIC-SIGNIFICANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BREAST-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH-FACTOR RECEPTOR</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48180</publishedID><Artikel>Reduced expression of nogo-a leads to motivational deficits in rats</Artikel><Journal>Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience</Journal><ABSTr>Nogo-A is an important neurite growth-regulatory protein in the adult and developing nervous system. Mice lacking Nogo-A, or rats with neuronal Nogo-A deficiency, exhibit behavioral abnormalities such as impaired short-term memory, decreased pre-pulse inhibition, and behavioral inflexibility. In the current study, we extended the behavioral profile of the Nogo-A deficient rat line with respect to reward sensitivity and motivation, and determined the concentrations of the monoamines dopamine and serotonin in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), dorsal striatum (dSTR), and nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Using a limited access consumption task, we found similar intake of a sweet condensed milk solution following ad libitum or restricted feeding in wild-type and Nogo-A deficient rats, indicating normal reward sensitivity and translation of hunger into feeding behavior. When tested for motivation in a spontaneous progressive ratio task, Nogo-A deficient rats exhibited lower break points and tended to have lower "highest completed ratios." Further, under extinction conditions responding ceased substantially earlier in these rats. Finally, in the PFC we found increased tissue levels of serotonin, while dopamine was unaltered. Dopamine and serotonin levels were also unaltered in the dSTR and the NAcc. In summary, these results suggest a role for Nogo-A regulated processes in motivated behavior and related neurochemistry.

We investigated primary tumors of 437 patients diagnosed between 1989 and 2006 by Sanger sequencing. Mutations were detected in 38.7% of patients and were associated with age, histological subtype as well as mitotic rate. The mutational rate was 36.7% in patients with disease-free course and 51.7% in those with subsequent distant metastasis (p = 0.031). No difference in overall survival (p = 0.119) but a trend for worse distant-metastasis-free survival (p = 0.061) was observed in BRAF mutant compared to BRAF wild-type patients. Independent prognostic factors for overall survival were tumor thickness, mitotic rate and ulceration. An interesting significant prognostic impact was observed in patients with tumor thickness of 1 mm or less, with the mutation present in 6 of 7 patients dying from melanoma. In conclusion, no significant survival differences were found according to BRAF-V600 tumor mutations in patients with primary melanoma but an increasing impact of the mutational status was observed in the subgroup of patients with tumor thickness of 1 mm or less. A potential role of the mutational status as a prognostic factor especially in this subgroup needs to be investigated in larger studies.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (1), e86194-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>e86194</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Meckbach D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Bauer J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Pflugfelder A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Meier F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Busch C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Eigentler TK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Capper D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="von Deimling A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Mittelbronn M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Perner S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Ikenberg K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Hantschke M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Buttner P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Garbe C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Weide B" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24475086</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0086194</DOI><KST>G380</KST><KST>L501</KST><KST>L801</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>BRAF V600E MUTATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NRAS MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AMERICAN JOINT COMMITTEE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CUTANEOUS MELANOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FREQUENCIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METASTATIC MELANOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INHIBITION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48184</publishedID><Artikel>Is vitamin D deficiency a cause of increased morbidity and mortality at older age or simply an indicator of poor health?</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Epidemiology</Journal><ABSTr>To assess whether vitamin D deficiency is a cause of increased morbidity and mortality or simply an indicator of poor health, we assessed (1) the cross-sectional and longitudinal association of vitamin D deficiency with self-rated health (SRH) and frailty and (2) the association of vitamin D deficiency with mortality, with and without control for SRH and frailty. Analyses were performed in 9,579 participants of the German, population-based ESTHER cohort (age-range at baseline: 50-74 years), with follow-ups after 2, 5 and 8 years (mortality: 12 years). During follow-up, 129 subjects newly reported poor SRH, 510 developed frailty and 1,450 died. In cross-sectional analyses, subjects with vitamin D deficiency had higher odds of a poor SRH and frailty but no association with SRH or frailty was observed in longitudinal analyses. The association of vitamin D deficiency with all-cause and several cause-specific mortalities was strong and unaltered by time-dependent adjustment for classic mortality risk factors, SRH and frailty. In conclusion, vitamin D deficiency may not cause frailty or poor general health but may nevertheless be a prognostic marker for mortality, independent of the individual's morbidity.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>29 (3), 199-210</Feld596><PubVol>29</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>199</StrtPage><EndPage>210</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schoettker B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Saum KU" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Perna L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Ordóñez-Mena JM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Holleczek B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24682834</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s10654-014-9894-3</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>POPULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CALCIUM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADULTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMMUNE FUNCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PARATHYROID-HORMONE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALL-CAUSE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SERUM 25-HYDROXYVITAMIN D</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FRAILTY SYNDROME</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48311</publishedID><Artikel>Survival of cancer patients in urban and rural areas of Germany - a comparison</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Epidemiology</Journal><ABSTr>Background: Cancer care services including cancer prevention activities are predominantly localised in central cities, potentially causing a heterogeneous geographic access to cancer care. The question of an association between residence in either urban or rural areas and cancer survival has been analysed in other parts of the world with inconsistent results. This study aims at a comparison of age-standardised 5-year survival of cancer patients resident in German urban and rural regions using data from 11 population-based cancer registries covering a population of 33 million people.

Material and methods: Patients diagnosed with cancers of the most frequent and of some rare sites in 1997-2006 were included in the analyses. Places of residence were assigned to rural and urban areas according to administrative district types of settlement structure. Period analysis and district type specific population life tables were used to calculate overall age-standardised 5-year relative survival estimates for the period 2002-2006. Poisson regression models for excess mortality (relative survival) were used to test for statistical significance.

Results: The 5-year relative survival estimates varied little among district types for most of the common sites with no consistent trend. Significant differences were found for female breast cancer patients and male malignant melanoma patients resident in city core regions with slightly better survival compared to all other district types, particularly for patients aged 65 years and older.

Conclusion: With regard to residence in urban or rural areas, the results of our study indicate that there are no severe differences concerning quality and accessibility of oncological care in Germany among different district types of settlement.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>38 (3), 259-265</Feld596><PubVol>38</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>259</StrtPage><EndPage>265</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Nennecke A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Geiss K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Hentschel S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Vettorazzi E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Jansen L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Eberle A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Holleczek B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Gondos A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="and the GEKID Cancer Survival Working Group" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24680643</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.canep.2014.02.011</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>imputation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACCESS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RELATIVE SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISTANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BREAST-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STAGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CARE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIAGNOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POPULATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48318</publishedID><Artikel>GWAS-identified common variants for obesity are not associated with the risk of developing colorectal cancer</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers and Prevention</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (6), 1125-1128</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>1125</StrtPage><EndPage>1128</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Sainz J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Frank B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Da Silva Filho MI" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Hoffmeister M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Rudolph A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Butterbach K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Chang-Claude J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Hemminki K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Foersti A" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24663336</PMID><DOI>10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-13-1354</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KST>C050</KST><KST>C070</KST></row><row><publishedID>48330</publishedID><Artikel>Scientific opinion on the risks to public health related to the presence of chromium in food and drinking water</Artikel><Journal>EFSA Journal</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>12 (3), 3595-261p.</Feld596><PubVol>12</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>3595</StrtPage><EndPage>261p.</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Edler,L. as member of the EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM)" IsDKFZ="1"/><KST>C060</KST></row><row><publishedID>48331</publishedID><Artikel>Direct cerebral and cardiac O-MRI at 3 Tesla: initial results at natural abundance</Artikel><Journal>Magnetic Resonance Materials in Physics Biology and Medicine</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: To establish direct 17O-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for metabolic imaging at a clinical field strength of 3 T.

Thorough insights into the molecules and pathways signaling glioma cell invasion thus appear of major relevance for the development of targeted and individualized therapies. By miRNA expression profiling of microdissected human tumor biopsy specimens we identified miR-328 as one of the main miRNAs upregulated in invading glioma cells in vivo and further investigated its role in glioma pathogenesis. Methods We employed miRNA mimics and inhibitors to functionally characterize miR-328, 3' untranslated region luciferase assays, and T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor reporter assays to pinpoint miR-328 targets and signaling pathways, and analyzed miR-328 expression in a large panel of gliomas. Results First, we corroborated the invasion-promoting role of miR-328 in A172 and TP365MG glioma cells. Secreted Frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1), an inhibitor of Wnt signaling, was then pinpointed as a direct miR-328 target. SFRP1 expression is of prognostic relevance in gliomas with reduced expression, being associated with significantly lower overall patient survival in both the Repository of Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data (REMBRANDT) and The Cancer Genome Atlas. Of note, miR-328 regulated both SFRP1 protein expression levels and Wnt signaling pathway activity. Finally, in human glioma tissues miR-328 appeared to account for the downregulation of SFRP1 preferentially in lower-grade astrocytic gliomas and was inversely related to SFRP1 promoter hypermethylation. Conclusion Taken together, we report on a novel molecular miR-328-dependent mechanism that via SFRP1 inhibition and Wnt activation contributes to the infiltrative glioma phenotype at already early stages of glioma progression, with unfavorable prognostic implications for the final outcome of the disease.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>16 (2), 179-190</Feld596><PubVol>16</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>179</StrtPage><EndPage>190</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Delic S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Lottmann N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Stelzl A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Liesenberg F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Wolter M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Gotze S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Zapatka M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Shiio Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Sabel MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Felsberg J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Reifenberger G" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Riemenschneider MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24305703</PMID><DOI>10.1093/neuonc/not164</DOI><KST>B060</KST><KST>L401</KST><KEYWORD>ANTAGONIST SFRP1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MALIGNANT GLIOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HYPERMETHYLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLIOBLASTOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Molecular targets</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHWAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DOWN-REGULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CERVICAL-CANCER</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48335</publishedID><Artikel>From a traditional medicinal plant to a rational drug: understanding the clinically proven wound healing efficacy of birch bark extract</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Birch bark has a long lasting history as a traditional medicinal remedy to accelerate wound healing. Recently, the efficacy of birch bark preparations has also been proven clinically. As active principle pentacyclic triterpenes are generally accepted. Here, we report a comprehensive study on the underlying molecular mechanisms of the wound healing properties of a well-defined birch bark preparation named as TE (triterpene extract) as well as the isolated single triterpenes in human primary keratinocytes and porcine ex-vivo wound healing models. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We show positive wound healing effects of TE and betulin in scratch assay experiments with primary human keratinocytes and in a porcine ex-vivo wound healing model (WHM). Mechanistical studies elucidate that TE and betulin transiently upregulate pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and cyclooxygenase-2 on gene and protein level. For COX-2 and IL-6 this increase of mRNA is due to an mRNA stabilizing effect of TE and betulin, a process in which p38 MAPK and HuR are involved. TE promotes keratinocyte migration, putatively by increasing the formation of actin filopodia, lamellipodia and stress fibers. Detailed analyses show that the TE components betulin, lupeol and erythrodiol exert this effect even in nanomolar concentrations. Targeting the actin cytoskeleton is dependent on the activation of Rho GTPases. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results provide insights to understand the molecular mechanism of the clinically proven wound healing effect of birch bark. TE and betulin address the inflammatory phase of wound healing by transient up-regulation of several pro-inflammatory mediators. Further, they enhance migration of keratinocytes, which is essential in the second phase of wound healing. Our results, together with the clinically proven efficacy, identify birch bark as the first medical plant with a high potential to improve wound healing, a field which urgently needs effective remedies.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (1), e86147-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>e86147</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Ebeling S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Naumann K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Pollok S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Wardecki T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Vidal-Y-Sy S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Nascimento JM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Boerries M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Schmidt G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Brandner JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Merfort I" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24465925</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0086147</DOI><KST>L601</KST><KEYWORD>CELL-MIGRATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATED PROTEIN-KINASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MESSENGER-RNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIN CYTOSKELETON</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>betulinic acid</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SELECTIVE CYCLOOXYGENASE-2 INHIBITION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>KERATINOCYTE MIGRATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COX-2 EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BINDING PROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RHO-GTPASES</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48336</publishedID><Artikel>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer significantly reduces number of yielded lymph nodes by axillary dissection</Artikel><Journal>BMC Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NC) is an established therapy in breast cancer, able to downstage positive axillary lymph nodes, but might hamper their detectibility. Even if clinical observations suggest lower lymph node yield (LNY) after NC, data are inconclusive and it is unclear whether NC dependent parameters influence detection rates by axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). METHODS: We analyzed retrospectively the LNY in 182 patients with ALND after NC and 351 patients with primary ALND. Impact of surgery or pathological examination and specific histomorphological alterations were evaluated. Outcome analyses regarding recurrence rates, disease free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were performed. RESULTS: Axillary LNY was significantly lower in the NC in comparison to the primary surgery group (median 13 vs. 16; p &lt; 0.0001). The likelihood of incomplete axillary staging was four times higher in the NC group (14.8% vs. 3.4%, p &lt; 0.0001). Multivariate analyses excluded any influence by surgeon or pathologist. However, the chemotherapy dependent histological feature lymphoid depletion was an independent predictive factor for a lower LNY. Outcome analyses revealed no significant impact of the LNY on local and regional recurrence rates as well as DFS and OS, respectively. CONCLUSION: NC significantly reduces the LNY by ALND and has profound effects on the histomorphological appearance of lymph nodes. The current recommendations for a minimum removal of 10 lymph nodes by ALND are clearly compromised by the clinically already established concept of NC. The LNY of less than 10 by ALND after NC might not be indicative for an insufficient axillary staging.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>14 (), Art.

The underlying mechanisms of this complex molecular cross-talk remain elusive. Here, we show that the expression of Angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) in LSECs is dynamically regulated after partial hepatectomy. During the early inductive phase of liver regeneration, Ang2 down-regulation leads to reduced LSEC transforming growth factor-beta1 production, enabling hepatocyte proliferation by releasing an angiocrine proliferative brake. During the later angiogenic phase of liver regeneration, recovery of endothelial Ang2 expression enables regenerative angiogenesis by controlling LSEC vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 expression. The data establish LSECs as a dynamic rheostat of liver regeneration, spatiotemporally orchestrating hepatocyte and LSEC proliferation through angiocrine- and autocrine-acting Ang2, respectively.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>343 (6169), 416-419</Feld596><PubVol>343</PubVol><PubIss>6169</PubIss><StrtPage>416</StrtPage><EndPage>419</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hu J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Srivastava K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Wieland M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Runge A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Mogler C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Besemfelder E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Terhardt D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Vogel MJ" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Cao L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Korn C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Bartels S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Thomas M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Augustin HG" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24458641</PMID><DOI>10.1126/science.1244880</DOI><KST>E020</KST><KST>A190</KST><KST>A101</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH-FACTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANGIOGENESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RAT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INDUCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEPATOCYTE PROLIFERATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TGF-BETA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANGIOCRINE SIGNALS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48338</publishedID><Artikel>CD33 target validation and sustained depletion of AML blasts in long-term cultures by the bispecific T-cell-engaging antibody AMG 330</Artikel><Journal>Blood</Journal><ABSTr>Antibody-based immunotherapy represents a promising strategy to target and eliminate chemoresistant leukemic cells. Here, we evaluated the CD33/CD3-bispecific T cell engaging (BiTE) antibody (AMG 330) for its suitability as a therapeutic agent in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We first assessed CD33 expression levels by flow cytometry and found expression in &gt;99% of patient samples (n = 621). CD33 was highest expressed in AMLs with NPM1 mutations (P &lt; .001) and lower in AMLs with complex karyotypes and t(8;21) translocations (P &lt; .001). Furthermore, leukemic stem cells within the CD34(+)/CD38(-) compartment displayed CD33 at higher levels than healthy donor stem cells (P = .047). In MS-5 feeder cell-based long-term cultures that supported the growth of primary AML blasts for up to 36 days, AMG 330 efficiently recruited and expanded residual CD3(+)/CD45RA(-)/CCR7(+) memory T cells within the patient sample. Even at low effector to target ratios, the recruited T cells lysed autologous blasts completely in the majority of samples and substantially in the remaining samples in a time-dependent manner. This study provides the first correlation of CD33 expression levels with AML genotype in a comprehensive analysis of adult patients. Targeting CD33 ex vivo using AMG 330 in primary AML samples led to T cell recruitment and expansion and remarkable antibody-mediated cytotoxicity, suggesting efficient therapeutic potential in vivo.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>123 (3), 356-365</Feld596><PubVol>123</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>356</StrtPage><EndPage>365</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Krupka C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Kufer P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kischel R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Zugmaier G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Bogeholz J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Kohnke T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Lichtenegger FS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Schneider S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Metzeler KH" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Fiegl M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Spiekermann K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Baeuerle PA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Hiddemann W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Riethmueller G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Subklewe M" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24300852</PMID><DOI>10.1182/blood-2013-08-523548</DOI><KST>L701</KST><KEYWORD>INTERNATIONAL EXPERT PANEL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GEMTUZUMAB OZOGAMICIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>B-LINEAGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION LEVELS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RESIDUAL DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACUTE MYELOID-LEUKEMIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SINGLE-CHAIN ANTIBODY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEMATOPOIETIC STEM-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC-LEUKEMIA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48339</publishedID><Artikel>Are caudal-type homeobox genes causal for gastro-esophageal reflux disease and Barrett's esophagus?</Artikel><Journal>Digestive Diseases and Sciences</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>59 (1), 16-18</Feld596><PubVol>59</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>16</StrtPage><EndPage>18</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Lassmann S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Werner M" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24052194</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s10620-013-2861-0</DOI><KST>L601</KST></row><row><publishedID>48342</publishedID><Artikel>The natural anticancer compound rocaglamide selectively inhibits the G1-S-phase transition in cancer cells through the ATM/ATR-mediated Chk1/2 cell cycle checkpoints</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Targeting the cancer cell cycle machinery is an important strategy for cancer treatment. Cdc25A is an essential regulator of cycle progression and checkpoint response. Over-expression of Cdc25A occurs often in human cancers. In this study, we show that Rocaglamide-A (Roc-A), a natural anticancer compound isolated from the medicinal plant Aglaia, induces a rapid phosphorylation of Cdc25A and its subsequent degradation and, thereby, blocks cell cycle progression of tumor cells at the G1-S phase. Roc-A has previously been shown to inhibit tumor proliferation by blocking protein synthesis. In this study, we demonstrate that besides the translation inhibition Roc-A can induce a rapid degradation of Cdc25A by activation of the ATM/ATR-Chk1/Chk2 checkpoint pathway. However, Roc-A has no influence on cell cycle progression in proliferating normal T lymphocytes. Investigation of the molecular basis of tumor selectivity of Roc-A by a time-resolved microarray analysis of leukemic vs. proliferating normal T lymphocytes revealed that Roc-A activates different sets of genes in tumor cells compared with normal cells. In particular, Roc-A selectively stimulates a set of genes responsive to DNA replication stress in leukemic but not in normal T lymphocytes. These findings further support the development of Rocaglamide for antitumor therapy.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>134 (8), 1991-2002</Feld596><PubVol>134</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>1991</StrtPage><EndPage>2002</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Neumann J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Boerries M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Koehler R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Giaisi M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Krammer PH" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Busch H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Li-Weber M" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24150948</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28521</DOI><KST>D030</KST><KST>L601</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>OXIDATIVE STRESS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA-DAMAGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHOSPHORYLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STABILIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CDC25A PHOSPHATASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>KINASE-ACTIVITIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ATM ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FLAVAGLINES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>C-FLIP EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BREAKS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48344</publishedID><Artikel>Identification of new genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer through consideration of gene-environment interactions</Artikel><Journal>Genetic Epidemiology</Journal><ABSTr>Genes that alter disease risk only in combination with certain environmental exposures may not be detected in genetic association analysis. By using methods accounting for gene-environment (G x E) interaction, we aimed to identify novel genetic loci associated with breast cancer risk. Up to 34,475 cases and 34,786 controls of European ancestry from up to 23 studies in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium were included. Overall, 71,527 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), enriched for association with breast cancer, were tested for interaction with 10 environmental risk factors using three recently proposed hybrid methods and a joint test of association and interaction. Analyses were adjusted for age, study, population stratification, and confounding factors as applicable. Three SNPs in two independent loci showed statistically significant association: SNPs rs10483028 and rs2242714 in perfect linkage disequilibrium on chromosome 21 and rs12197388 in ARID1B on chromosome 6. While rs12197388 was identified using the joint test with parity and with age at menarche (P-values = 3 x 10(-07)), the variants on chromosome 21 q22.12, which showed interaction with adult body mass index (BMI) in 8,891 postmenopausal women, were identified by all methods applied. SNP rs10483028 was associated with breast cancer in women with a BMI below 25 kg/m(2) (OR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.15-1.38) but not in women with a BMI of 30 kg/m(2) or higher (OR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.72-1.11, P for interaction = 3.2 x 10(-05)). Our findings confirm comparable power of the recent methods for detecting G x E interaction and the utility of using G x E interaction analyses to identify new susceptibility loci.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>38 (1), 84-93</Feld596><PubVol>38</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>84</StrtPage><EndPage>93</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schoeps A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Rudolph A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Seibold P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Dunning AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Milne RL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Bojesen SE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Swerdlow A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Andrulis I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Behrens S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Orr N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Jones M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Ashworth A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Li J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Cramp H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Connley D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Czene K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Darabi H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Chanock SJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Lissowska J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Figueroa JD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Knight J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Glendon G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Mulligan AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Dumont M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Severi G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Baglietto L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Olson J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Vachon C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Purrington K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Moisse M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Neven P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Wildiers H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Spurdle A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Kosma VM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Kataja V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Hartikainen JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Hamann U" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="38" name="Ko YD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Dieffenbach AK" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="40" name="Arndt V" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="41" name="Stegmaier C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Malats N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Arias Perez JI" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="44" name="Benitez J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="45" name="Flyger H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="46" name="Nordestgaard BG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="47" name="Truong T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="48" name="Cordina-Duverger E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="49" name="Menegaux F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="50" name="dos Santos Silva I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="51" name="Fletcher O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="52" name="Johnson N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="53" name="Haberle L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="54" name="Beckmann MW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="55" name="Ekici AB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="56" name="Braaf L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="57" name="Atsma F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="58" name="van den Broek AJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="59" name="Makalic E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="60" name="Schmidt DF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="61" name="Southey MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="62" name="Cox A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="63" name="Simard J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="64" name="Giles GG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="65" name="Lambrechts D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="66" name="Mannermaa A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="67" name="Brauch H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="68" name="Guenel P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="69" name="Peto J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="70" name="Fasching PA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="71" name="Hopper J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="72" name="Flesch-Janys D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="73" name="Couch F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="74" name="Chenevix-Trench G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="75" name="Pharoah PD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="76" name="Garcia-Closas M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="77" name="Schmidt MK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="78" name="Hall P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="79" name="Easton DF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="80" name="Chang-Claude J" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24248812</PMID><DOI>10.1002/gepi.21771</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KST>C070</KST><KST>B072</KST><KST>L801</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HORMONE-THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FGFR2 GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METAANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BODY-MASS INDEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VARIANTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK-FACTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FAMILY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COHORT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WOMEN</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48346</publishedID><Artikel>HERG k(+) channel-dependent apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in human glioblastoma cells</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>Glioblastoma (GB) is associated with poor patient survival owing to uncontrolled tumor proliferation and resistance to apoptosis. Human ether-a-go-go-related gene K(+) channels (hERG; Kv11.1, KCNH2) are expressed in multiple cancer cells including GB and control cell proliferation and death. We hypothesized that pharmacological targeting of hERG protein would inhibit tumor growth by inducing apoptosis of GB cells. The small molecule hERG ligand doxazosin induced concentration-dependent apoptosis of human LNT-229 (EC50 = 35 microM) and U87MG (EC50 = 29 microM) GB cells, accompanied by cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase. Apoptosis was associated with 64% reduction of hERG protein. HERG suppression via siRNA-mediated knock down mimicked pro-apoptotic effects of doxazosin. Antagonism of doxazosin binding by the non-apoptotic hERG ligand terazosin resulted in rescue of protein expression and in increased survival of GB cells. At the molecular level doxazosin-dependent apoptosis was characterized by activation of pro-apoptotic factors (phospho-erythropoietin-producing human hepatocellular carcinoma receptor tyrosine kinase A2, phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, growth arrest and DNA damage inducible gene 153, cleaved caspases 9, 7, and 3), and by inactivation of anti-apoptotic poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase, respectively. In summary, this work identifies doxazosin as small molecule compound that promotes apoptosis and exerts anti-proliferative effects in human GB cells. Suppression of hERG protein is a crucial molecular event in GB cell apoptosis. Doxazosin and future derivatives are proposed as novel options for more effective GB treatment.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (2), e88164-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>e88164</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Staudacher I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Jehle J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Staudacher K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Pledl HW" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Lemke D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Schweizer PA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Becker R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Katus HA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Thomas D" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24516604</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0088164</DOI><KST>G370</KST><KST>G160</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>GENE-THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>protein trafficking</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TYROSINE KINASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INHIBITION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Plus:MODERATE ESSENTIAL-HYPERTENSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PERSISTENT ATRIAL-FIBRILLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DOXAZOSIN INDUCES APOPTOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LONG QT SYNDROME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POTASSIUM CHANNELS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CARDIAC-ARRHYTHMIA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48350</publishedID><Artikel>mTOR target NDRG1 confers MGMT-dependent resistance to alkylating chemotherapy</Artikel><Journal>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</Journal><ABSTr>A hypoxic microenvironment induces resistance to alkylating agents by activating targets in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. The molecular mechanisms involved in this mTOR-mediated hypoxia-induced chemoresistance, however, are unclear. Here we identify the mTOR target N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) as a key determinant of resistance toward alkylating chemotherapy, driven by hypoxia but also by therapeutic measures such as irradiation, corticosteroids, and chronic exposure to alkylating agents via distinct molecular routes involving hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha, p53, and the mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2)/serum glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase 1 (SGK1) pathway. Resistance toward alkylating chemotherapy but not radiotherapy was dependent on NDRG1 expression and activity. In posttreatment tumor tissue of patients with malignant gliomas, NDRG1 was induced and predictive of poor response to alkylating chemotherapy. On a molecular level, NDRG1 bound and stabilized methyltransferases, chiefly O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), a key enzyme for resistance to alkylating agents in glioblastoma patients. In patients with glioblastoma, MGMT promoter methylation in tumor tissue was not more predictive for response to alkylating chemotherapy in patients who received concomitant corticosteroids.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>111 (1), 409-414</Feld596><PubVol>111</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>409</StrtPage><EndPage>414</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Weiler M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Blaes J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Pusch S*" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Sahm F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Czabanka M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Luger S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Bunse L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Solecki G" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Eichwald V" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Jugold M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Hodecker S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Osswald M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Meisner C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Hielscher T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="14" name="Ruebmann P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Pfenning PN" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="16" name="Ronellenfitsch M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="17" name="Kempf T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="18" name="Schnoelzer M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="19" name="Abdollahi A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="20" name="Lang F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Bendszus M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="von Deimling A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="23" name="Winkler F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="24" name="Weller M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="25" name="Vajkoczy P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="26" name="Platten M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="27" name="Wick W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="28" name="(*shared first author)" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24367102</PMID><DOI>10.1073/pnas.1314469111</DOI><KST>B100</KST><KST>C060</KST><KST>G380</KST><KST>G370</KST><KST>G160</KST><KST>E210</KST><KST>W240</KST><KST>L201</KST><KST>L401</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>HYPOXIA-INDUCIBLE FACTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>temozolomide</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLIOBLASTOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLIOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUPPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48351</publishedID><Artikel>Stem cell-like side populations in esophageal cancer: a source of chemotherapy resistance and metastases</Artikel><Journal>Stem Cells and Development</Journal><ABSTr>Dye-effluxing side population (SP) cells can be resistant to chemotherapy and are thought to resemble cancer stem cells. We characterized the relevance of the SP subpopulation in esophageal cancer cell lines and their relation to chemotherapy resistance and metastasis. The SP subpopulation was detected using Hoechst 33342 staining in five esophageal cancer cell lines OE19, OE21, OE33, PT1590, and LN1590. CTx-resistant cell lines were developed after long-term exposure to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin and validated by analysis of resistance markers, thymidylate synthase and ERCC1. While neither LN1590 nor PT1590 had detectable SP cells, OE19, OE21, and OE33 cells were found to contain varying levels of SP cells. With increasing duration of 5-FU or cisplatin therapy, the SP subpopulation substantially emerged in PT1590 and LN1590. OE19-SP cells displayed significant higher tumorigenicity than OE19- non-SP (NSP) cells after subcutaneous tumor cell injection in vivo. SP cells isolated from OE19 and OE19/5-FUres were subsequently analyzed by an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) polymerase chain reaction array. Interestingly, the SP fraction of OE19/5-FUres showed a dramatic upregulation of EMT-related genes compared to the SP fraction of OE19. Our results provide evidence that (1) the proportion of SP cells is different in esophageal cancer, (2) SP cells exhibit stem cell properties and are associated to chemotherapy resistance, and (3) long-term CTx selects for SP cells with an upregulated EMT gene profile, which might be the source of systemic disease relapse. Further investigations are necessary to ideally target these EMT-associated SP cells in esophageal cancer.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (2), 180-192</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>180</StrtPage><EndPage>192</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Zhao Y" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Bao Q" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Schwarz B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Zhao L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Mysliwietz J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Ellwart J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Renner A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Hirner H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Niess H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Camaj P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Angele M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Gros S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Izbicki J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Jauch KW" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="14" name="Nelson PJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Bruns CJ" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24021093</PMID><DOI>10.1089/scd.2013.0103</DOI><KST>L701</KST><KEYWORD>GROWTH-FACTOR RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>carcinoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LUNG-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DRUG-RESISTANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGENITOR CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR PROGRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IDENTIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PANCREATIC-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48352</publishedID><Artikel>The hox gene abd-B controls stem cell niche function in the Drosophila testis</Artikel><Journal>Developmental Cell</Journal><ABSTr>Proper niche architecture is critical for stem cell function, yet only few upstream regulators are known. Here, we report that the Hox transcription factor Abdominal-B (Abd-B), active in premeiotic spermatocytes of Drosophila testes, is essential for positioning the niche to the testis anterior by regulating integrin in neighboring somatic cyst cells. Abd-B also non-cell-autonomously controls critical features within the niche, including centrosome orientation and division rates of germline stem cells. By using genome-wide binding studies, we find that Abd-B mediates its effects on integrin localization by directly controlling at multiple levels the signaling activity of the Sev ligand Boss via its direct targets src42A and sec63, two genes involved in protein trafficking and recycling. Our data show that Abd-B, through local signaling between adjucent cell types, provides positional cues for integrin localization, which is critical for placement of the distant stem cell niche and stem cell activity.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>28 (2), 189-202</Feld596><PubVol>28</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>189</StrtPage><EndPage>202</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Papagiannouli F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Schardt L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Grajcarek J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Ha N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Lohmann I" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24480643</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.devcel.2013.12.016</DOI><KST>A110</KST><KEYWORD>BITHORAX COMPLEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEMATOPOIETIC STEM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ABDOMINAL-B</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LAMININ-A</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>centrosome</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GERM-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SELF-RENEWAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>F-ACTIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SRC FAMILY KINASES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEIN</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48353</publishedID><Artikel>Adaptive designs with arbitrary dependence structure</Artikel><Journal>Biometrical Journal</Journal><ABSTr>Adaptive designs were originally developed for independent and uniformly distributed p-values. There are trial settings where independence is not satisfied or where it may not be possible to check whether it is satisfied. In these cases, the test statistics and p-values of each stage may be dependent. Since the probability of a type I error for a fixed adaptive design depends on the true dependence structure between the p-values of the stages, control of the type I error rate might be endangered if the dependence structure is not taken into account adequately. In this paper, we address the problem of controlling the type I error rate in two-stage adaptive designs if any dependence structure between the test statistics of the stages is admitted (worst case scenario). For this purpose, we pursue a copula approach to adaptive designs. For two-stage adaptive designs without futility stop, we derive the probability of a type I error in the worst case, that is for the most adverse dependence structure between the p-values of the stages. Explicit analytical considerations are performed for the class of inverse normal designs. A comparison with the significance level for independent and uniformly distributed p-values is performed. For inverse normal designs without futility stop and equally weighted stages, it turns out that correcting for the worst case is too conservative as compared to a simple Bonferroni design.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>56 (1), 86-106</Feld596><PubVol>56</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>86</StrtPage><EndPage>106</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schmidt R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Faldum A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Witt O" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Gerss J" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24395207</PMID><DOI>10.1002/bimj.201200234</DOI><KST>G340</KST><KEYWORD>CLINICAL-TRIALS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CORRELATED TEST STATISTICS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROUP SEQUENTIAL TRIALS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BOUNDS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48379</publishedID><Artikel>Cigarette Smoke Extracts induce and repress Genes in human embryonic Lung Cells</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Research</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>5 (3), -</Feld596><PubVol>5</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage/><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Braun,K."

The technique is adapted for in vivo small animal imaging, specifically for imaging of nude mice, and does not require an additional imaging step (e.g., by means of a secondary structural modality) or additional hardware (e.g., laser-scanning approaches). Any potential point within the field of view (FOV) is evaluated by a proposed photo-consistency measure, utilizing sensor image light information as provided by elemental images (EIs). As the superposition of adjacent EIs yields depth information for any point within the FOV, the three-dimensional surface of the imaged object is estimated by a graph cuts-based method through global energy minimization. The proposed surface reconstruction is evaluated on simulated MLA-D data, incorporating a reconstructed mouse data volume as acquired by x-ray computed tomography. Compared with a previously presented back projection-based surface reconstruction method, the proposed technique yields a significantly lower error rate. Moreover, while the back projection-based method may not be able to resolve concave surfaces, this approach does. Our results further indicate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy at a low number of projections.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>53 (2), -</Feld596><PubVol>53</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage/><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Jiang,X."

Functional changes in this enzyme may influence endogenous hormone exposure, which has been associated with risk of breast cancer. To assess potential associations between two functional polymorphisms CYP2B6_516_G&gt;T (rs3745274) and CYP2B6_785_A&gt;G (rs2279343) and breast cancer risk, we established a specific matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry assay. The GENICA breast cancer case-control study showed associations between the variant genotypes CYP2B6_516_TT and CYP2B6_785_GG and breast cancer risk with odds ratios (ORs) of 1.34 (p = 0.001) and 1.31 (p = 0.002), respectively. A similar effect was observed for carriers of the CYP2B6_516_T allele in a validation study including four independent studies from Germany, Sweden and USA. In a pooled analysis of all five studies involving 4,638 breast cancer cases and 3,594 controls of European ancestry, carriers of the CYP2B6_516_G and the CYP2B6_785_G variant had an increased breast cancer risk with ORs of 1.10 (p = 0.027) and 1.10 (p = 0.031), respectively. We conclude that the genetic variants CYP2B6_516_G and CYP2B6_785_G (designated CYP2B6*6), which are known to decrease activity of the CYP2B6 enzyme, contribute to an increased breast cancer risk.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>134 (2), 426-430</Feld596><PubVol>134</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>426</StrtPage><EndPage>430</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Justenhoven,C."

Our aim was to evaluate the prognostic and predictive value of two well characterized constitutional MTHFR gene polymorphisms for primarily resected and neoadjuvantly treated esophagogastric adenocarcinomas. METHODS: 569 patients from two centers were analyzed (gastric cancer: 218, carcinoma of the esophagogastric junction (AEG II, III): 208 and esophagus (AEG I): 143). 369 patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery, 200 patients were resected without preoperative treatment. The MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms were determined in DNA from peripheral blood lymphozytes. Associations with prognosis, response and clinicopathological factors were analyzed retrospectively within a prospective database (chi-square, log-rank, cox regression). RESULTS: Only the MTHFR A1298C polymorphisms had prognostic relevance in neoadjuvantly treated patients but it was not a predictor for response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The AC genotype of the MTHFR A1298C polymorphisms was significantly associated with worse outcome (p = 0.02, HR 1.47 (1.06-2.04). If neoadjuvantly treated patients were analyzed based on their tumor localization, the AC genotype of the MTHFR A1298C polymorphisms was a significant negative prognostic factor in patients with gastric cancer according to UICC 6th edition (gastric cancer including AEG type II, III: HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.3-2.0, p = 0.001) and 7th edition (gastric cancer without AEG II, III: HR 2.8, 95% CI 1.5-5.7, p = 0.003), not for AEG I. For both definitions of gastric cancer the AC genotype was confirmed as an independent negative prognostic factor in cox regression analysis. In primarily resected patients neither the MTHFR A1298C nor the MTHFR C677T polymorphisms had prognostic impact. CONCLUSIONS: The MTHFR A1298C polymorphisms was an independent prognostic factor in patients with neoadjuvantly treated gastric adenocarcinomas (according to both UICC 6th or 7th definitions for gastric cancer) but not in AEG I nor in primarily resected patients, which confirms the impact of this enzyme on chemotherapy associated outcome.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>14 (), Art.

Human RR small subunit M2 exists in a homodimer form. However, the importance of the dimer form to the enzyme and the related mechanism remain unclear. In this study, we tried to identify the interfacial residues that may mediate the assembly of M2 homodimer by computational alanine scanning based on the x-ray crystal structure. Co-immunoprecipitation, size exclusion chromatography, and RR activity assays showed that the K95E mutation in M2 resulted in dimer disassembly and enzyme activity inhibition. In comparison, the charge-exchanging double mutation of K95E and E98K recovered the dimerization and activity. Structural comparisons suggested that a conserved cluster of charged residues, including Lys-95, Glu-98, Glu-105, and Glu-174, at the interface may function as an ionic lock for M2 homodimer. Although the measurements of the radical and iron contents showed that the monomer (the K95E mutant) was capable of generating the diiron and tyrosyl radical cofactor, co-immunoprecipitation and competitive enzyme inhibition assays indicated that the disassembly of M2 dimer reduced its interaction with the large subunit M1. In addition, the immunofluorescent and fusion protein-fluorescent imaging analyses showed that the dissociation of M2 dimer altered its subcellular localization. Finally, the transfection of the wild-type M2 but not the K95E mutant rescued the G1/S phase cell cycle arrest and cell growth inhibition caused by the siRNA knockdown of M2. Thus, the conserved Lys-95 charged residue cluster is critical for human RR M2 homodimerization, which is indispensable to constitute an active holoenzyme and function in cells.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>289 (2), 909-920</Feld596><PubVol>289</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>909</StrtPage><EndPage>920</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Chen X" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Xu Z" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Zhang L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Liu H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Liu X" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Lou M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Zhu L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Huang B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Yang CG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Zhu W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Shao J" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24253041</PMID><DOI>10.1074/jbc.M113.524546</DOI><KST>W190</KST><KEYWORD>SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VITRO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ESCHERICHIA-COLI</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA-REPLICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOLECULAR-MECHANICS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PARTICLE MESH EWALD</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEIN R2</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALLOSTERIC REGULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ELECTRON-TRANSFER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUBCELLULAR-LOCALIZATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48433</publishedID><Artikel>Active and passive cigarette smoking and breast cancer risk: Results from the EPIC cohort</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Recent cohort studies suggest that increased breast cancer risks were associated with longer smoking duration, higher pack-years and a dose-response relationship with increasing pack-years of smoking between menarche and first full-term pregnancy (FFTP). Studies with comprehensive quantitative life-time measures of passive smoking suggest an association between passive smoking dose and breast cancer risk. We conducted a study within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition to examine the association between passive and active smoking and risk of invasive breast cancer and possible effect modification by known breast cancer risk factors. Among the 322,988 women eligible for the study, 9,822 developed breast cancer (183,608 women with passive smoking information including 6,264 cases). When compared to women who never smoked and were not being exposed to passive smoking at home or work at the time of study registration, current, former and currently exposed passive smokers were at increased risk of breast cancer (hazard ratios (HR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] 1.16 [1.05-1.28], 1.14 [1.04-1.25] and 1.10 [1.01-1.20], respectively). Analyses exploring associations in different periods of life showed the most important increase in risk with pack-years from menarche to FFTP (1.73 [1.29-2.32] for every increase of 20 pack-years) while pack-years smoked after menopause were associated with a significant decrease in breast cancer risk (HR = 0.53, 95% CI: 0.34-0.82 for every increase of 20 pack-years). Our results provide an important replication, in the largest cohort to date, that smoking (passively or actively) increases breast cancer risk and that smoking between menarche and FFTP is particularly deleterious.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>134 (8), 1871-1888</Feld596><PubVol>134</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>1871</StrtPage><EndPage>1888</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Dossus L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Boutron-Ruault MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kaaks R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Gram IT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Vilier A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Fervers B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Manjer J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Olsen A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Chang-Claude J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Steffen A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Lagiou P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Sarantopoulou M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Palli D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Berrino F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Vineis P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Mattiello A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="van Duijnhoven FJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Bakker MF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Peeters PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Bjerkaas E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Braaten T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Menendez V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Agudo A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Sanchez MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Amiano P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Tormo MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Barricarte A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Butt S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Wareham N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Key TJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Travis RC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Rinaldi S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="McCormack V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Romieu I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Cox DG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Norat T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="44" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="45" name="Clavel-Chapelon F" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24590452</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28508</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METAANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCO-SMOKE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEVER SMOKERS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CALIFORNIA TEACHERS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>1ST CHILDBIRTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CARCINOGENS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPOSURE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48434</publishedID><Artikel>Oncology and Care in Specialist and Public Media</Artikel><Journal>Onkologe</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>20 (2), 169-171</Feld596><PubVol>20</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>169</StrtPage><EndPage>171</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Gaisser,A."

Here, we introduce these artificial riboswitches for regulation of DNA and RNA viruses. We hypothesize that they represent universally applicable tools for studying viral gene functions and for applications as a safety switch for oncolytic and live vaccine viruses. Our study shows that the insertion of artificial aptazymes into the adenoviral immediate early gene E1A enables small-molecule-triggered, dose-dependent inhibition of gene expression. Aptazyme-mediated shutdown of E1A expression translates into inhibition of adenoviral genome replication, infectious particle production, and cytotoxicity/oncolysis. These results provide proof of concept for the aptazyme approach for effective control of biological outcomes in eukaryotic systems, specifically in virus infections. Importantly, we also demonstrate aptazyme-dependent regulation of measles virus fusion protein expression, translating into potent reduction of progeny infectivity and virus spread. This not only establishes functionality of aptazymes in fully cytoplasmic genetic systems, but also implicates general feasibility of this strategy for application in viruses with either DNA or RNA genomes. Our study implies that gene regulation by artificial riboswitches may be an appealing alternative to Tet- and other protein-dependent gene regulation systems, based on their small size, RNA-intrinsic mode of action, and flexibility of the inducing molecule. Future applications range from gene analysis in basic research to medicine, for example as a safety switch for new generations of efficiency-enhanced oncolytic viruses.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>111 (5), E554-E562</Feld596><PubVol>111</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>E554</StrtPage><EndPage>E562</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ketzer P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Kaufmann JK" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Engelhardt S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Bossow S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="von Kalle C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hartig JS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Ungerechts G" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Nettelbeck DM" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24449891</PMID><DOI>10.1073/pnas.1318563111</DOI><KST>F110</KST><KST>G100</KST><KEYWORD>transcription</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INHIBITION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ATTENUATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADENOVIRUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REGULATORY SYSTEMS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RIBOZYMES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MEASLES-VIRUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTERFERENCE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48439</publishedID><Artikel>Evolution of oxytocin pathways in the brain of vertebrates</Artikel><Journal>Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience</Journal><ABSTr>The central oxytocin system transformed tremendously during the evolution, thereby adapting to the expanding properties of species. In more basal vertebrates (paraphyletic taxon Anamnia, which includes agnathans, fish and amphibians), magnocellular neurosecretory neurons producing homologs of oxytocin reside in the wall of the third ventricle of the hypothalamus composing a single hypothalamic structure, the preoptic nucleus. This nucleus further diverged in advanced vertebrates (monophyletic taxon Amniota, which includes reptiles, birds, and mammals) into the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei with accessory nuclei (AN) between them. The individual magnocellular neurons underwent a process of transformation from primitive uni- or bipolar neurons into highly differentiated neurons. Due to these microanatomical and cytological changes, the ancient release modes of oxytocin into the cerebrospinal fluid were largely replaced by vascular release. However, the most fascinating feature of the progressive transformations of the oxytocin system has been the expansion of oxytocin axonal projections to forebrain regions. In the present review we provide a background on these evolutionary advancements. Furthermore, we draw attention to the non-synaptic axonal release in small and defined brain regions with the aim to clearly distinguish this way of oxytocin action from the classical synaptic transmission on one side and from dendritic release followed by a global diffusion on the other side. Finally, we will summarize the effects of oxytocin and its homologs on pro-social reproductive behaviors in representatives of the phylogenetic tree and will propose anatomically plausible pathways of oxytocin release contributing to these behaviors in basal vertebrates and amniots.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>8 (), Art.

Cure rates of about 40% in pediatric high-risk medulloblastoma (MB) patients also indicate the need of new therapeutic approaches. In order to prepare a future application of oncolytic parvovirotherapy to MB, the present study preclinically evaluates the cytotoxic efficacy of H-1PV on MB cells in vitro and characterizes cellular target genes involved in this effect. Six MB cell lines were analyzed by whole genome oligonucleotide microarrays after treatment and the results were matched to known molecular and cytogenetic risk factors. In contrast to non-transformed infant astrocytes and neurons, in five out of six MB cell lines lytic H-1PV infection and efficient viral replication could be demonstrated. The cytotoxic effects induced by H-1PV were observed at LD50s below 0.05 p. f. u. per cell indicating high susceptibility. Gene expression patterns in the responsive MB cell lines allowed the identification of candidate target genes mediating the cytotoxic effects of H-1PV. H-1PV induced down-regulation of key regulators of early neurogenesis shown to confer poor prognosis in MB such as ZIC1, FOXG1B, MYC, and NFIA. In MB cell lines with genomic amplification of MYC, expression of MYC was the single gene most significantly repressed after H-1PV infection. H-1PV virotherapy may be a promising treatment approach for MB since it targets genes of functional relevance and induces cell death at very low titers of input virus.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>134 (3), 703-716</Feld596><PubVol>134</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>703</StrtPage><EndPage>716</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Lacroix J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Schlund F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Leuchs B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Adolph K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Sturm D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Bender S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Hielscher T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Pfister SM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Witt O" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Rommelaere J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Schlehofer JR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Witt H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>23852775</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28386</DOI><KST>C060</KST><KST>F010</KST><KST>G340</KST><KST>D015</KST><KST>B062</KST><KEYWORD>INDUCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INFECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REPLICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEURONAL DIFFERENTIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RAT MODELS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SIGNALING CASCADES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MEASLES-VIRUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MYC</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48448</publishedID><Artikel>Metastasis of prostate cancer and melanoma cells in a preclinical in vivo mouse model is enhanced by L-plastin expression and phosphorylation</Artikel><Journal>Molecular Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Tumor cell migration and metastasis require dynamic rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton. Interestingly, the F-actin cross-linking and stabilizing protein L-plastin, originally described as a leukocyte specific protein, is aberrantly expressed in several non-hematopoietic malignant tumors. Therefore, it has been discussed as a tumor marker. However, systematic in vivo analyses of the functional relevance of L-plastin for tumor cell metastasis were so far lacking. METHODS: We investigated the relevance of L-plastin expression and phosphorylation by ectopical expression of L-plastin in human melanoma cells (MV3) and knock-down of endogenous L-plastin in prostate cancer (PC3M). The growth and metastatic potential of tumor cells expressing no L-plastin, phosphorylatable or non-phosphorylatable L-plastin was analyzed in a preclinical mouse model after subcutaneous and intracardial injection of the tumor cells. RESULTS: Knock-down of endogenous L-plastin in human prostate carcinoma cells led to reduced tumor cell growth and metastasis. Vice versa, and in line with these findings, ectopic expression of L-plastin in L-plastin negative melanoma cells significantly increased the number of metastases. Strikingly, the metastasis promoting effect of L-plastin was not observed if a non-phosphorylatable L-plastin mutant was expressed. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide the first in vivo evidence that expression of L-plastin promotes tumor metastasis and, importantly, that this effect depends on an additionally required phosphorylation of L-plastin. In conclusion, these findings imply that for determining the importance of tumor-associated proteins like L-plastin a characterization of posttranslational modifications is indispensable.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>13 (), Art.

Here, we report that three distinct phagocyte subsets play highly coordinated roles in bacterial urinary tract infection. Ly6C(-) macrophages acted as tissue-resident sentinels that attracted circulating neutrophils and Ly6C(+) macrophages. Such Ly6C(+) macrophages played a previously undescribed helper role: once recruited to the site of infection, they produced the cytokine TNF, which caused Ly6C(-) macrophages to secrete CXCL2. This chemokine activated matrix metalloproteinase-9 in neutrophils, allowing their entry into the uroepithelium to combat the bacteria. In summary, the sentinel macrophages elicit the powerful antibacterial functions of neutrophils only after confirmation by the helper macrophages, reminiscent of the licensing role of helper T cells in antiviral adaptive immunity. These findings identify helper macrophages and TNF as critical regulators in innate immunity against bacterial infections in epithelia.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>156 (3), 456-468</Feld596><PubVol>156</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>456</StrtPage><EndPage>468</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schiwon M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Weisheit C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Franken L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Gutweiler S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Dixit A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Meyer-Schwesinger C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Pohl JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Maurice NJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Thiebes S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Lorenz K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Quast T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Fuhrmann M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Baumgarten G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Lohse MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Opdenakker G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Bernhagen J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Bucala R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Panzer U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Kolanus W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Groene HJ" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="20" name="Garbi N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Kastenmueller W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Knolle PA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Kurts C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Engel DR" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24485454</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.cell.2014.01.006</DOI><KST>G130</KST><KEYWORD>DENDRITIC CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPITHELIAL-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMMUNE-RESPONSE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ESCHERICHIA-COLI</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NECROSIS-FACTOR-ALPHA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHEMOKINE RECEPTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BACTERIAL-INFECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BASEMENT-MEMBRANES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>URINARY-TRACT-INFECTION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48450</publishedID><Artikel>Paediatric and adult glioblastoma: multiform (epi)genomic culprits emerge</Artikel><Journal>Nature Reviews Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>We have extended our understanding of the molecular biology that underlies adult glioblastoma over many years.

Micrometer to millimeter wide synchrotron-generated X-ray beamlets produced by spatial fractionation of the main beam could generate such fiber disruptions non-invasively. The aim of this work was to optimize irradiation parameters for the induction of fiber transections in the rat brain white matter by exposure to such beamlets. For this purpose, we irradiated cortex and external capsule of normal rats in the antero-posterior direction with a 4 mmx4 mm array of 25 to 1000 mu m wide beamlets and entrance doses of 150 Gy to 500 Gy. Axonal fiber responses were assessed with diffusion tensor imaging and fiber tractography; myelin fibers were examined histopathologically. Our study suggests that high radiation doses (500 Gy) are required to interrupt axons and myelin sheaths. However, a radiation dose of 500 Gy delivered by wide minibeams (1000 mu m) induced macroscopic brain damage, depicted by a massive loss of matter in fiber tractography maps. With the same radiation dose, the damage induced by thinner microbeams (50 to 100 mu m) was limited to their paths. No macroscopic necrosis was observed in the irradiated target while overt transections of myelin were detected histopathologically. Diffusivity values were found to be significantly reduced. A radiation dose &lt;= 500 Gy associated with a beamlet size of &lt;50 mu m did not cause visible transections, neither on diffusion maps nor on sections stained for myelin. We conclude that a peak dose of 500 Gy combined with a microbeam width of 100 mu m optimally induced axonal transections in the white matter of the brain.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (2), e88244-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>e88244</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Serduc,R."

The second pulse converts single- into triple-quantum coherences in regions containing sodium ions which are restricted in mobility. Since only single-quantum coherences can be detected, an image acquired after the second pulse is intrinsically single-quantum-filtered and can be used to generate a biexponential-weighted sodium image by a weighted subtraction with the spin-density-weighted image acquired between the pulses.

The proposed sequence generates biexponential-weighted sodium images of in vivo human brain with 140% higher SNR than triple-quantum-filtered sodium images and 4% higher SNR than a biexponential-weighted sequence with three RF pulses at equal acquisition time and with 1/3 lower SAR. As SAR is reduced, accordingly repetition time can be spared to obtain even higher SNR-time efficiency. In comparison to a difference image generated from two images of a double-readout sequence, the proposed two-pulse sequence yields about 14% higher SNR.

Our new two-pulse biexponential-weighted sequence allows for acquisition of full 3D data sets of the human brain in vivo with a nominal resolution of (5 mm)(3) in about 10 min.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>240 (), 67-76</Feld596><PubVol>240</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>67</StrtPage><EndPage>76</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Benkhedah,N."

MethodsAn iterative reconstruction algorithm for 3D projection reconstruction (3DPR) is presented that combines prior anatomical knowledge and image sparsity under a total variation (TV) constraint. A binary mask (BM) is used as an anatomical constraint to penalize non-zero signal intensities outside the object. The BM&amp;TV method is evaluated in simulations and in MR measurements in volunteers.

ResultsIn simulated BM&amp;TV brain data, the artifact level was reduced by 20% while structures were well preserved compared to gridding. SNR maps showed a spatially dependent SNR gain over gridding reconstruction, which was up to 100% for simulated data. Undersampled 3DPR Na-23 MRI of the human brain revealed an SNR increase of 297%. Small anatomical structures were reproduced with a mean contrast loss of 14%, whereas in TV-regularized iterative reconstructions a loss of 66% was found.

ConclusionThe BM&amp;TV algorithm allows reconstructing images with increased SNR and reduced artifact level compared to gridding and performs superior to an iterative reconstruction using an unspecific TV constraint only.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>71 (5), 1720-1732</Feld596><PubVol>71</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>1720</StrtPage><EndPage>1732</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Gnahm,C."

To optimize and interpret creatine-CEST imaging we characterized the dependence of the exchange-rate constant k(sw) of creatine guanidinium protons in aqueous creatine solutions as a function of pH and temperature T in vitro. Model solutions in the low pH range (pH=5-6.4) were measured by means of water-exchange (WEX)-filtered H-1 NMR spectroscopy on a 3T whole-body MR tomograph. An extension of the Arrhenius equation with effective base-catalyzed Arrhenius parameters yielded a general expression for k(sw)(pH, T). The defining parameters were identified as the effective base-catalyzed rate constant k(b,eff)(298.15K)=(3.009 +/- 0.16)x10(9)Hzl/mol and the effective activation energy E-A,E-b,E-eff=(32.27 +/- 7.43) kJ/mol at a buffer concentration of c(buffer)=(1/15) M. As expected, a strong dependence of k(sw) on temperature was observed. The extrapolation of the exchange-rate constant to in vivo conditions (pH=7.1, T=37 degrees C) led to the value of the exchange-rate constant k(sw)=1499Hz. With the explicit function k(sw)(pH, T) available, absolute-pH CEST imaging could be realized and experimentally verified in vitro.

Recent in vitro data showed similar effects of laser-accelerated versus "conventional" protons on clonogenic cell survival. As the proton energies currently achieved by laser driven acceleration are too low to penetrate standard tumour models on mouse legs, the aim of the present work was to establish a tumour model allowing for the penetration of low energy protons (ca. 20 MeV) to further verify their effects in vivo. METHODS: KHT mouse sarcoma cells were injected subcutaneously in the right ear of NMRI (nu/nu) mice and the growing tumours were characterized with respect to growth parameters, histology and radiation response. In parallel, the laser system JETI was prepared for animal experimentation, i.e. a new irradiation setup was implemented and the laser parameters were carefully adjusted. Finally, a proof-of-principle experiment with laser accelerated electrons was performed to validate the tumour model under realistic conditions, i.e. altered environment and horizontal beam delivery. RESULTS: KHT sarcoma on mice ears showed a high take rate and continuous tumour growth after reaching a volume of ca. 5 mm(3). The first irradiation experiment using laser accelerated electrons versus 200 kV X-rays was successfully performed and tumour growth delay was evaluated. Comparable tumour growth delay was found between X-ray and laser accelerated electron irradiation. Moreover, experimental influences, like anaesthesia and positioning at JETI, were found to be negligible. CONCLUSION: A small animal tumour model suitable for the irradiation with low energy particles was established and validated at a laser based particle accelerator. Thus, the translation from in vitro to in vivo experimentation was for the first time realized allowing a broader preclinical validation of radiobiological characteristics and efficacy of laser driven particle accelerators in the future.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (), Art.

In this work, we want to contribute a practical concept that addresses these requirements. METHODS: We proposed a concept for individualized patient allocation to photon or particle beam therapy at a non-particle radiotherapy institution that bases on remote treatment plan comparison. We translated this concept into the web-based software tool ReCompare (REmote COMparison of PARticlE and photon treatment plans). RESULTS: We substantiated the feasibility of the proposed concept by demonstrating remote exchange of treatment plans between radiotherapy institutions and the direct comparison of photon and particle treatment plans in photon treatment planning systems. ReCompare worked with several tested standard treatment planning systems, ensured patient data protection, and integrated in the clinical workflow. CONCLUSIONS: Our concept supports non-particle radiotherapy institutions with the patient-specific treatment decision on the optimal irradiation modality by providing expertise from a particle therapy center. The software tool ReCompare may help to improve and standardize this personalized treatment decision. It will be available from our website when proton therapy is operational at our facility.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (), Art. Nr.: 59-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>Art.

In this regard, the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab has been approved alone or in combination with: (a) chemotherapy for treatment of colorectal and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and (b) with external radiotherapy for treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The conjugation of radionuclides to cetuximab in combination with the specific targeting properties of this antibody might increase its therapeutic efficiency. This review article gives an overview of the preclinical studies that have been performed with radiolabeled cetuximab for imaging and/or treatment of different tumor models. A particularly promising approach seems to be the treatment with therapeutic radionuclide-labeled cetuximab in combination with external radiotherapy. Present data support an important impact of the tumor micromilieu on treatment response that needs to be further validated in patients. Another important challenge is the reduction of nonspecific uptake of the radioactive substance in metabolic organs like liver and radiosensitive organs like bone marrow and kidneys. Overall, the integration of diagnosis, treatment and monitoring as a theranostic approach appears to be a promising strategy for improvement of individualized cancer treatment.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>7 (3), 311-338</Feld596><PubVol>7</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>311</StrtPage><EndPage>338</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Sihver W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Pietzsch J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Krause M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Baumann M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Steinbach J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Pietzsch HJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24603603</PMID><DOI>10.3390/ph7030311</DOI><KST>L301</KST></row><row><publishedID>48558</publishedID><Artikel>What next?</Artikel><Journal>Radiotherapy and Oncology</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>110 (1), 1-2</Feld596><PubVol>110</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>1</StrtPage><EndPage>2</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Baumann M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Overgaard J" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24636157</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.radonc.2014.02.004</DOI><KST>L301</KST></row><row><publishedID>48566</publishedID><Artikel>EGFR-Mediated Chromatin Condensation Protects KRAS-Mutant Cancer Cells Against Ionizing Radiation</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Research</Journal><ABSTr>Therapeutics that target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) can enhance the cytotoxic effects of ionizing radiation (IR). However, predictive genomic biomarkers of this radiosensitization have remained elusive. By screening 40 non-small cell lung cancer cell (NSCLC) lines, we established a surprising positive correlation between the presence of a KRAS mutation and radiosensitization by the EGFR inhibitors erlotinib and cetuximab. EGFR signaling in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells promotes chromatin condensation in-vitro and in-vivo, thereby restricting the number of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) produced by a given dose of IR. Chromatin condensation in interphase cells is characterized by an unexpected mitosis-like co-localization of serine 10 phosphorylation and lysine 9 trimethylation on histone H3. Aurora B promotes this process in a manner that is co-dependent upon EGFR and PKCa. PKCa, in addition to MEK/ERK signaling, is required for the suppression of DSB-inducible premature senescence by EGFR. Blockade of autophagy results in a mutant KRAS-dependent senescence-to-apoptosis switch in cancer cells treated with IR and erlotinib. In conclusion, we identify EGFR as a molecular target to overcome a novel mechanism of radioresistance in KRAS-mutant tumor cells, which stands in contrast to the unresponsiveness of KRAS-mutant cancers to EGFR-directed agents in monotherapy. Our findings may reposition EGFR-targeted agents for combination with DSB-inducing therapies in KRAS-mutant NSCLC.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>74 (10), 2825-2834</Feld596><PubVol>74</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>2825</StrtPage><EndPage>2834</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Wang M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Kern AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Hülskotter M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Greninger P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Singh A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Pan Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Chowdhury D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Krause M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Baumann M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Benes CH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Efstathiou JA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Settleman J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Willers H" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24648348</PMID><DOI>10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-3157</DOI><KST>L301</KST><KEYWORD>CELLULAR SENESCENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH-FACTOR-RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACQUIRED-RESISTANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHASE-II</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Ras</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DOUBLE-STRAND BREAKS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DRUG-SENSITIVITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA-DAMAGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LUNG-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INHIBITION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48571</publishedID><Artikel>Concise Review: The Bone Marrow Niche as a Target of Graft Versus Host Disease</Artikel><Journal>Stem Cells</Journal><ABSTr>Graft versus host disease (GvHD) remains a major complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and is the main cause of transplant-related mortality (TRM). In addition to visceral organ involvement, concomitant myelosuppression has been repeatedly described and the extent of cytopenia has been introduced into GvHD scoring systems. Both hematopoietic cells and cells that form the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) niche have been identified as targets of GvHD. Although several contributing factors have been previously described, the pathophysiology of GvHD-mediated myelosuppression remains largely unclear and to date, no specific therapeutic interventions have achieved routine clinical application. This review focuses on the bone marrow as a target of GvHD, the factors that contribute to myelosuppression, and the possible therapeutic approaches.

Fast image acquisition at two different X-ray energies enables the determination of tissue- or material-specific features, the calculation of virtual unenhanced images and the quantification of contrast medium uptake; thus, tissue can be characterised and subsequently monitored for any changes during treatment. DECT is already widely used, but its potential in the context of oncological imaging has not been fully exploited yet. The technology is the subject of ongoing innovation and increasingly with respect to its clinical potential, particularly in oncology.

In this approach, the sensitivity matrix is estimated based on planar phantom acquisitions, rather than tracing along lines of response (LORs). The algorithm is implemented by distributing the calculation of the acquired list-mode events into different threads yielding significantly increased computational speed. A list-mode random correction approach is presented in which reconstructed data are corrected according to a smooth correction image estimated from delayed coincidence data. Monte Carlo simulations based on GATE were performed to validate the proposed approach. A Derenzo phantom study shows that the 1.2-mm hot rods can be resolved using the presented algorithm. A breast-torso phantom study as well as a study based on acquired patient data demonstrate its feasibility in a clinical environment. This method reaches a significant higher calculation efficiency in which the total reconstruction time is less than 30 seconds for a typical clinical study. Results show that bias from random coincidences is largely suppressed. The presented algorithm achieves a fast and low-noise reconstructions without compromising intrinsic system resolution and sensitivity.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>61 (3), 1182-1191</Feld596><PubVol>61</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>1182</StrtPage><EndPage>1191</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Cao,L."

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials and observational studies.

Data sources PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. Two investigators independently extracted characteristics and results of identified studies and performed standardised quality ratings.

Eligibility criteria Randomised controlled trials and observational studies in English on the impact of screening sigmoidoscopy and screening colonoscopy on colorectal cancer incidence and mortality in the general population at average risk.

Results For screening sigmoidoscopy, four randomised controlled trials and 10 observational studies were identified that consistently found a major reduction in distal but not proximal colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. Summary estimates of reduction in distal colorectal cancer incidence and mortality were 31% (95% confidence intervals 26% to 37%) and 46% (33% to 57%) in intention to screen analysis, 42% (29% to 53%) and 61% (27% to 79%) in per protocol analysis of randomised controlled trials, and 64% (50% to 74%) and 66% (38% to 81%) in observational studies. For screening colonoscopy, evidence was restricted to six observational studies, the results of which suggest tentatively an even stronger reduction in distal colorectal cancer incidence and mortality, along with a significant reduction in mortality from cancer of the proximal colon. Indirect comparisons of results of observational studies on screening sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy suggest a 40% to 60% lower risk of incident colorectal cancer and death from colorectal cancer after screening colonoscopy even though this incremental risk reduction was statistically significant for deaths from cancer of the proximal colon only.

Conclusions Compelling and consistent evidence from randomised controlled trials and observational studies suggests that screening sigmoidoscopy and screening colonoscopy prevent most deaths from distal colorectal cancer. Observational studies suggest that colonoscopy compared with flexible sigmoidoscopy decreases mortality from cancer of the proximal colon. This added value should be examined in further research and weighed against the higher costs, discomfort, complication rates, capacities needed, and possible differences in compliance.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>348 (), g2467-</Feld596><PubVol>348</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>g2467</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Stock C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Hoffmeister M" IsDKFZ="1"/><DOI>10.1136/bmj.g2467</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>POPULATION-BASED-ANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LOWER ENDOSCOPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TELEMARK POLYP</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>prevention</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>UNITED-STATES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FOLLOW-UP</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SIDED COLON-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OCCULT BLOOD-TEST</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FLEXIBLE SIGMOIDOSCOPY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48635</publishedID><Artikel>Frailty prevalence and 10-year survival in community-dwelling older adults: results from the ESTHER cohort study</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Epidemiology</Journal><ABSTr>The frailty index (FI), defined by a deficit accumulation approach, has emerged as a promising concept in gerontological research, but applications have been mostly restricted to populations from Canada and the United States aged 65 years or older. Baseline data from the German ESTHER cohort study (N 9,886; age 50-75; mean follow-up 8.7 years) were used to create a FI through a deficit accumulation approach. For estimation of frailty prevalence, we used cut-points for the FI to define three categories (non-frail 0 to a parts per thousand currency sign0.20; pre-frail &gt; 0.20 to &lt; 0.45; frail a parts per thousand yen0.45). We assessed variation of the FI by age and sex: 10-year survival according to baseline FI was assessed by Kaplan-Meier curves and bivariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. Cubic splines were used to assess sex-specific dose-response associations. Prevalence of frailty was 9.2 and 10.5 % in women and men, respectively. Age-specific prevalence of frailty ranged from 4.6 % in 50-54 year old participants to 17.0 % in 70-75 year old participants. Below 60 years of age, men had a higher FI than women. However, the FI showed a stronger increase with age among women (3.1 % per year) than among men (1.7 % per year) and was higher among women than men in older age groups. Adjusted hazard ratios (95 % confidence intervals) for all-cause mortality were 1.08 (0.84-1.39), 1.32 (1.05-1.66), 1.77 (1.41-2.22), and 2.60 (2.11-3.20) for the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th quintile of the FI compared to 1st quintile, respectively. There was a strong dose-response relationship between the FI and total mortality among both men and women and both younger (&lt; 65 years) and older subjects.

However, such studies cannot determine the source of vitamin D. Therefore, we examined the association of dietary vitamin D intake with incident type 2 diabetes within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-InterAct study in a heterogeneous European population including eight countries with large geographical variation. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Using a case-cohort design, 11,245 incident cases of type 2 diabetes and a representative subcohort (N=15,798) were included in the analyses. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for type 2 diabetes were calculated using a Prentice-weighted Cox regression adjusted for potential confounders. Twenty-four-hour diet-recall data from a subsample (N=2347) were used to calibrate habitual intake data derived from dietary questionnaires. RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 10.8 years. Dietary vitamin D intake was not significantly associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes. HR and 95% CIs for the highest compared to the lowest quintile of uncalibrated vitamin D intake was 1.09 (0.97-1.22) (Ptrend=0.17). No associations were observed in a sex-specific analysis. The overall pooled effect (HR (95% CI)) using the continuous calibrated variable was 1.00 (0.97-1.03) per increase of 1 mug/day dietary vitamin D. CONCLUSIONS: This observational study does not support an association between higher dietary vitamin D intake and type 2 diabetes incidence. This result has to be interpreted in light of the limited contribution of dietary vitamin D on the overall vitamin D status of a person.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>68 (2), 196-202</Feld596><PubVol>68</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>196</StrtPage><EndPage>202</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Abbas S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Linseisen J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Rohrmann S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Beulens JW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Buijsse B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Amiano P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Ardanaz E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Balkau B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Clavel-Chapelon F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Fagherazzi G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Franks PW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Gavrila D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Grioni S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Kaaks R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Key TJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Kuhn T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Mattiello A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Molina-Montes E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Nilsson PM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Quiros JR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Rolandsson O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Sacerdote C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Saieva C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Slimani N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Sluijs I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Spijkerman AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="van der A DL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Zamora-Ros R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Sharp SJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Langenberg C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Forouhi NG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Wareham NJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24253760</PMID><DOI>10.1038/ejcn.2013.235</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>COHORT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CALCIUM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CALIBRATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WOMEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INSULIN-SECRETION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>1,25-DIHYDROXYVITAMIN D-3</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>25-HYDROXYVITAMIN D CONCENTRATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEALTH REPORT 2004</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METAANALYSIS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48639</publishedID><Artikel>Next-generation sequencing reveals how RNA catalysts evolve from random space</Artikel><Journal>Nucleic Acids Research</Journal><ABSTr>Catalytic RNAs are attractive objects for studying molecular evolution. To understand how RNA libraries can evolve from randomness toward highly active catalysts, we analyze the original samples that led to the discovery of Diels-Alderase ribozymes by next-generation sequencing. Known structure-activity relationships are used to correlate abundance with catalytic performance. We find that efficient catalysts arose not just from selection for reactivity among the members of the starting library, but from improvement of less potent precursors by mutations. We observe changes in the ribozyme population in response to increasing selection pressure. Surprisingly, even after many rounds of enrichment, the libraries are highly diverse, suggesting that potential catalysts are more abundant in random space than generally thought. To highlight the use of next-generation sequencing as a tool for in vitro selections, we also apply this technique to a recent, less characterized ribozyme selection. Making use of the correlation between sequence evolution and catalytic activity, we predict mutations that improve ribozyme activity and validate them biochemically. Our study reveals principles underlying ribozyme in vitro selections and provides guidelines to render future selections more efficient, as well as to predict the conservation of key structural elements, allowing the rational improvement of catalysts.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>42 (2), 1303-1310</Feld596><PubVol>42</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>1303</StrtPage><EndPage>1310</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ameta S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Winz ML" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Previti C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Jaeschke A" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24157838</PMID><DOI>10.1093/nar/gkt949</DOI><KST>W190</KST><KEYWORD>FIDELITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIELS-ALDERASE RIBOZYME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ERRORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AMPLIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA-POLYMERASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SELECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIVERSITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EVOLUTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POLYMERASE-CHAIN-REACTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VITRO</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48640</publishedID><Artikel>Premature terminal differentiation protects from deregulated lymphocyte activation by ITK-Syk</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Immunology</Journal><ABSTr>The development of hematopoietic neoplasms is often associated with mutations, altered gene expression or chromosomal translocations. Recently, the t(5, 9)(q33;q22) translocation was found in a subset of peripheral T cell lymphomas and was shown to result in an IL-2-inducible kinase-spleen tyrosine kinase (ITK-Syk) fusion transcript. In this study, we show that T cell-specific expression of the ITK-Syk oncogene in mice leads to an early onset and aggressive polyclonal T cell lymphoproliferation with concomitant B cell expansion and systemic inflammation by 7-9 wk of age. Because this phenotype is strikingly different from previous work showing that ITK-Syk expression causes clonal T cell lymphoma by 20-27 wk of age, we investigated the underlying molecular mechanism in more detail. We show that the reason for the severe phenotype is the lack of B-lymphocyte-induced maturation protein-1 (Blimp-1) induction by low ITK-Syk expression. In contrast, high ITK-Syk oncogene expression induces terminal T cell differentiation in the thymus by activating Blimp-1, thereby leading to elimination of oncogene-expressing cells early in development. Our data suggest that terminal differentiation is an important mechanism to prevent oncogene-expressing cells from malignant transformation, as high ITK-Syk oncogene activity induces cell elimination. Accordingly, for transformation, a specific amount of oncogene is required, or alternatively, the induction of terminal differentiation is defective.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>192 (3), 1024-1033</Feld596><PubVol>192</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>1024</StrtPage><EndPage>1033</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Bach MP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Hug E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Werner M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Holch J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Sprissler C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Pechloff K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Zirlik K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Zeiser R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Dierks C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Ruland J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Jumaa H" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24376268</PMID><DOI>10.4049/jimmunol.1300420</DOI><KST>L601</KST><KST>L701</KST><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TYROSINE KINASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>T-CELL-RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALLELIC EXCLUSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPRESSOR BLIMP-1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISTINCT ROLES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEGATIVE SELECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>B-CELL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MICE LACKING</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48641</publishedID><Artikel>A genome-wide "pleiotropy scan" does not identify new susceptibility Loci for estrogen receptor negative breast cancer</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>Approximately 15-30% of all breast cancer tumors are estrogen receptor negative (ER-). Compared with ER-positive (ER+) disease they have an earlier age at onset and worse prognosis. Despite the vast number of risk variants identified for numerous cancer types, only seven loci have been unambiguously identified for ER-negative breast cancer. With the aim of identifying new susceptibility SNPs for this disease we performed a pleiotropic genome-wide association study (GWAS). We selected 3079 SNPs associated with a human complex trait or disease at genome-wide significance level (P&lt;5x10(-8)) to perform a secondary analysis of an ER-negative GWAS from the National Cancer Institute's Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3), including 1998 cases and 2305 controls from prospective studies. We then tested the top ten associations (i.e. with the lowest P-values) using three additional populations with a total sample size of 3509 ER+ cases, 2543 ER- cases and 7031 healthy controls. None of the 3079 selected variants in the BPC3 ER-GWAS were significant at the adjusted threshold. 186 variants were associated with ER- breast cancer risk at a conventional threshold of P&lt;0.05, with P-values ranging from 0.049 to 2.3x10(-4). None of the variants reached statistical significance in the replication phase. In conclusion, this study did not identify any novel susceptibility loci for ER-breast cancer using a "pleiotropic approach".</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (2), e85955-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>e85955</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Campa D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Barrdahl M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Tsilidis KK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Severi G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Diver WR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Siddiq A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Chanock S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Hoover RN" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Ziegler RG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Berg CD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Buys SS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Haiman CA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Henderson BE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Schumacher FR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Le Marchand L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Flesch-Janys D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Lindstrom S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Hunter DJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Hankinson SE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Willett WC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Kraft P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Cox DG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Dossus L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Trichopoulos D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Panico S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="van Gils CH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Barricarte A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Sund M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Gaudet MM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Giles G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Southey M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Baglietto L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Chang-Claude J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="36" name="Kaaks R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="37" name="Canzian F" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24523857</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0085955</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KST>C055</KST><KEYWORD>COMPLEX DISEASES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METAANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRAITS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48642</publishedID><Artikel>Risk of ovarian cancer and the NF-kappaB pathway: genetic association with IL1A and TNFSF10</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Research</Journal><ABSTr>A missense single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the immune modulatory gene IL1A has been associated with ovarian cancer risk (rs17561). Although the exact mechanism through which this SNP alters risk of ovarian cancer is not clearly understood, rs17561 has also been associated with risk of endometriosis, an epidemiologic risk factor for ovarian cancer. Interleukin-1alpha (IL1A) is both regulated by and able to activate NF-kappaB, a transcription factor family that induces transcription of many proinflammatory genes and may be an important mediator in carcinogenesis. We therefore tagged SNPs in more than 200 genes in the NF-kappaB pathway for a total of 2,282 SNPs (including rs17561) for genotype analysis of 15,604 cases of ovarian cancer in patients of European descent, including 6,179 of high-grade serous (HGS), 2,100 endometrioid, 1,591 mucinous, 1,034 clear cell, and 1,016 low-grade serous, including 23,235 control cases spanning 40 studies in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium. In this large population, we confirmed the association between rs17561 and clear cell ovarian cancer [OR, 0.84; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.76-0.93; P = 0.00075], which remained intact even after excluding participants in the prior study (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.75-0.95; P = 0.006). Considering a multiple-testing-corrected significance threshold of P &lt; 2.5 x 10(-5), only one other variant, the TNFSF10 SNP rs6785617, was associated significantly with a risk of ovarian cancer (low malignant potential tumors OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.79-0.91; P = 0.00002). Our results extend the evidence that borderline tumors may have a distinct genetic etiology. Further investigation of how these SNPs might modify ovarian cancer associations with other inflammation-related risk factors is warranted.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>74 (3),

death via c-Jun upregulation</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Letters</Journal><ABSTr>Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1, HGNC: 6943), a pro-survival member of the Bcl-2 family, plays a crucial role in Multiple Myeloma (MM) pathogenesis and drug resistance, thus representing a promising therapeutic target in MM. A novel strategy to inhibit Mcl-1 activity is the induction of ubiquitin-independent Mcl-1 degradation. Our own and other previous studies have demonstrated caspase-dependent generation of a 28kDa Mcl-1 fragment, Mcl-1(128-350), which inhibits MM cell proliferation and survival. Here, we show that similar to bortezomib, the novel proteasome inhibitors carfilzomib and ixazomib, as well as staurosporine and adaphostin, induce the generation of Mcl-1(128-350) in MM cells. Next, the molecular sequelae downstream of Mcl-1(128-350), which mediate its pro-apoptotic activity, were delineated. Surprisingly, we observed nuclear accumulation of drug-induced or exogenously overexpressed Mcl-1(128-350), followed by elevated mRNA and protein levels of c-Jun, as well as enhanced AP-1 reporter activity. Moreover, drug-induced AP-1 activity was blocked after introducing a point mutation into the highly conserved Mcl-1 caspase-cleavage site Asp127, but not Asp157. Consequently, drug-triggered cell death was significantly decreased in MM cells transfected with Mcl-1 D127A, but not with Mcl-1 D157A. Consistent with these data, treatment with bortezomib triggered c-Jun upregulation followed by apoptosis in Mcl-1(wt/wt), but not Mcl-1(Delta/null) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Transfection of a plasmid carrying Mcl-1(wt) into Mcl-1(Delta/null) MEFs restored bortezomib-induced Mcl-1 fragmentation, c-Jun upregulation and AP-1 reporter activity. Finally, our data indicate that drug-induced generation of a pro-apoptotic Mcl-1 fragment followed by c-Jun upregulation may also be a novel therapeutic approach in other tumor entities.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>343 (2), 286-294</Feld596><PubVol>343</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>286</StrtPage><EndPage>294</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Fan F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Tonon G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bashari MH" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Vallet S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Antonini E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Goldschmidt H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Schulze-Bergkamen H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Opferman JT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Sattler M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Anderson KC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Jaeger D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Podar K" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24120758</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.canlet.2013.09.042</DOI><KST>G010</KST><KST>D120</KST><KEYWORD>BORTEZOMIB</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANTI-APOPTOTIC MCL-1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NOXA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DEGRADATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CLEAVAGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHWAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIFFERENTIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEIN</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48644</publishedID><Artikel>Smooth muscle cell mineralocorticoid receptors are mandatory for aldosterone-salt to induce vascular stiffness</Artikel><Journal>Hypertension</Journal><ABSTr>Arterial stiffness is recognized as a risk factor for many cardiovascular diseases. Aldosterone via its binding to and activation of the mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) is a main regulator of blood pressure by controlling renal sodium reabsorption. Although both clinical and experimental data indicate that MR activation by aldosterone is involved in arterial stiffening, the molecular mechanism is not known. In addition to the kidney, MR is expressed in both endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), but the specific contribution of the VSMC MR to aldosterone-induced vascular stiffness remains to be explored. To address this question, we generated a mouse model with conditional inactivation of the MR in VSMC (MR(SMKO)). MR(SMKO) mice show no alteration in renal sodium handling or vascular structure, but they have decreased blood pressure when compared with control littermate mice. In vivo at baseline, large vessels of mutant mice presented with normal elastic properties, whereas carotids displayed a smaller diameter when compared with those of the control group. As expected after aldosterone/salt challenge, the arterial stiffness increased in control mice; however, it remained unchanged in MR(SMKO) mice, without significant modification in vascular collagen/elastin ratio. Instead, we found that the fibronectin/alpha5-subunit integrin ratio is profoundly altered in MR(SMKO) mice because the induction of alpha5 expression by aldosterone/salt challenge is prevented in mice lacking VSMC MR. Altogether, our data reveal in the aldosterone/salt hypertension model that MR activation specifically in VSMC leads to the arterial stiffening by modulation of cell-matrix attachment proteins independent of major vascular structural changes.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>63 (3), 520-526</Feld596><PubVol>63</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>520</StrtPage><EndPage>526</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Galmiche G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Pizard A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Gueret A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="El Moghrabi S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Ouvrard-Pascaud A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Berger S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Challande P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Jaffe IZ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Labat C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Lacolley P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Jaisser F" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24296280</PMID><KST>A992</KST><KEYWORD>RATS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BLOOD-PRESSURE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CAROTID-ARTERY FIBROSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTIMA-MEDIA THICKNESS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WALL ELASTIC-MODULUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ESSENTIAL-HYPERTENSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PULSE PRESSURE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SPIRONOLACTONE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FIBRONECTIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEART-FAILURE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48645</publishedID><Artikel>Analysis of early strains of the norovirus pandemic variant GII.4 Sydney 2012 identifies mutations in adaptive sites of the capsid protein</Artikel><Journal>Virology</Journal><ABSTr>Global surveillance for norovirus identified in 2012 the emergence of a novel pandemic GII.4 variant, termed Sydney 2012. In Italy, the novel pandemic variant was identified as early as November 2011 but became predominant only in the winter season 2012-2013. Upon sequencing and comparison with strains of global origin, the early Sydney 2012 strains were found to differ from those spreading in 2012-2013 in the capsid (ORF2) putative epitopes B, C and D, segregating into a distinct phylogenetic clade. At least three residues (333, 340 and 393, in epitopes B, C and D, respectively) of the VP1 varied among Sydney 2012 strains of different clades. These findings suggest that the spread of the pandemic variant in Italy during the winter season 2012-2013 was due to the introduction of strains distinct from those circulating at low frequency in the former winter season and that similar strains were also circulating elsewhere worldwide.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>450-451 (), 355-358</Feld596><PubVol>450-451</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>355</StrtPage><EndPage>358</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Giammanco GM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="De Grazia S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Terio V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Lanave G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Catella C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Bonura F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Saporito L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Medici MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Tummolo F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Calderaro A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Banyai K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Hansman G" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Martella V" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24503099</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.virol.2013.12.007</DOI><KST>F150</KST><KEYWORD>EPOCHAL EVOLUTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GASTROENTERITIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EMERGENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHILDREN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>recombination</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48646</publishedID><Artikel>Cancer risk in amyloidosis patients in Sweden with novel findings on non-Hodgkin lymphoma and skin cancer</Artikel><Journal>Annals of Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Systemic amyloidoses include immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis, serum amyloid (AA)-related amyloidosis and senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA). AL amyloidosis is associated with myeloma, and we showed recently that transthyretin-related hereditary amyloidosis was related to non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). In SSA, amyloids constitute wild-type transthyretin. We wanted to analyze cancer risks in amyloidosis, particularly in SSA. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nonhereditary amyloidosis patients were identified from the Swedish Hospital Discharge and Outpatients Registers from years 1997 through 2010. Their cancer risk was assessed based on the Swedish Cancer Registry using standardized incidence ratio (SIR) between amyloidosis patients and the remaining population. To gain information about amyloidosis subtypes, we used the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register from years 2005 through 2010 to find out the specific medication prescribed. RESULTS: Among 1400 identified amyloidosis patients, cancer risk was increased for myeloma, NHL and squamous cell skin cancer. Myeloma and skin cancers were diagnosed 7-8 years earlier than in the population, whereas NHL was diagnosed in elderly patients. The SIR was 204 for myeloma in patients who received AL amyloidosis medication, and it was 17.22 in patients receiving rheumatoid arthritis medication, suggesting AA amyloidosis. In remaining patients, including SSA, NHL risk was 14.78, including lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (51.41) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (18.69). In these patients, endometrial cancer (7.04) and cancer of unknown primary site (6.56) were also increased. CONCLUSIONS: SSA is likely to be a main cause of NHL in the elderly population. The present findings suggest a novel mechanism for amyloidosis-related cancer, highlighting the role of chronic stimulation by amyloid.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>25 (2), 511-518</Feld596><PubVol>25</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>511</StrtPage><EndPage>518</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hemminki K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Li X" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Foersti A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Sundquist J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Sundquist K" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24406424</PMID><DOI>10.1093/annonc/mdt544</DOI><KST>C050</KST><KEYWORD>AL amyloidosis</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SENILE SYSTEMIC AMYLOIDOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RHEUMATIC-DISEASES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DEPOSITION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CASE SERIES</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48647</publishedID><Artikel>Prior-based artifact correction (PBAC) in computed tomography</Artikel><Journal>Medical Physics</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: Image quality in computed tomography (CT) often suffers from artifacts which may reduce the diagnostic value of the image. In many cases, these artifacts result from missing or corrupt regions in the projection data, e.g., in the case of metal, truncation, and limited angle artifacts. The authors propose a generalized correction method for different kinds of artifacts resulting from missing or corrupt data by making use of available prior knowledge to perform data completion. METHODS: The proposed prior-based artifact correction (PBAC) method requires prior knowledge in form of a planning CT of the same patient or in form of a CT scan of a different patient showing the same body region. In both cases, the prior image is registered to the patient image using a deformable transformation. The registered prior is forward projected and data completion of the patient projections is performed using smooth sinogram inpainting. The obtained projection data are used to reconstruct the corrected image. RESULTS: The authors investigate metal and truncation artifacts in patient data sets acquired with a clinical CT and limited angle artifacts in an anthropomorphic head phantom data set acquired with a gantry-based flat detector CT device. In all cases, the corrected images obtained by PBAC are nearly artifact-free. Compared to conventional correction methods, PBAC achieves better artifact suppression while preserving the patient-specific anatomy at the same time. Further, the authors show that prominent anatomical details in the prior image seem to have only minor impact on the correction result. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that PBAC has the potential to effectively correct for metal, truncation, and limited angle artifacts if adequate prior data are available. Since the proposed method makes use of a generalized algorithm, PBAC may also be applicable to other artifacts resulting from missing or corrupt data.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>41 (2), Art.

However, among vendors and researchers, there is no consensus of how to best achieve these goals. The authors are focusing on the aspect of geometric ray profile modeling, which is realized by some algorithms, while others model the ray as a straight line. The authors incorporate ray-modeling (RM) in nonregularized iterative reconstruction. That means, instead of using one simple single needle beam to represent the x-ray, the authors evaluate the double integral of attenuation path length over the finite source distribution and the finite detector element size in the numerical forward projection. Our investigations aim at analyzing the resolution recovery (RR) effects of RM. Resolution recovery means that frequencies can be recovered beyond the resolution limit of the imaging system. In order to evaluate, whether clinical CT images can benefit from modeling the geometrical properties of each x-ray, the authors performed a 2D simulation study of a clinical CT fan-beam geometry that includes the precise modeling of these geometrical properties. METHODS: All simulations and reconstructions are performed in native fan-beam geometry. A water phantom with resolution bar patterns and a Forbild thorax phantom with circular resolution patterns representing calcifications in the heart region are simulated. An FBP reconstruction with a Ram-Lak kernel is used as a reference reconstruction. The FBP is compared to iterative reconstruction techniques with and without RM: An ordered subsets convex (OSC) algorithm without any RM (OSC), an OSC where the forward projection is modeled concerning the finite focal spot and detector size (OSC-RM) and an OSC with RM and with a matched forward and backprojection pair (OSC-T-RM, T for transpose). In all cases, noise was matched to be able to focus on comparing spatial resolution. The authors use two different simulation settings. Both are based on the geometry of a typical clinical CT system (0.7 mm detector element size at isocenter, 1024 projections per rotation). Setting one has an exaggerated source width of 5.0 mm. Setting two has a realistically small source width of 0.5 mm. The authors also investigate the transition from setting one to two. To quantify image quality, the authors analyze line profiles through the resolution patterns to define a contrast factor (CF) for contrast-resolution plots, and the authors compare the normalized cross-correlation (NCC) with respect to the ground truth of the circular resolution patterns. To independently analyze whether RM is of advantage, the authors implemented several iterative reconstruction algorithms: The statistical iterative reconstruction algorithm OSC, the ordered subsets simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (OSSART) and another statistical iterative reconstruction algorithm, denoted with ordered subsets maximum likelihood (OSML) algorithm. All algorithms were implemented both without RM (denoted as OSC, OSSART, and OSML) and with RM (denoted as OSC-RM, OSSART-RM, and OSML-RM). RESULTS: For the unrealistic case of a 5.0 mm focal spot the CF can be improved by a factor of two due to RM: the 4.2 LP/cm bar pattern, which is the first bar pattern that cannot be resolved without RM, can be easily resolved with RM. For the realistic case of a 0.5 mm focus, all results show approximately the same CF. The NCC shows no significant dependency on RM when the source width is smaller than 2.0 mm (as in clinical CT). From 2.0 mm to 5.0 mm focal spot size increasing improvements can be observed with RM. CONCLUSIONS: Geometric RM in iterative reconstruction helps improving spatial resolution, if the ray cross-section is significantly larger than the ray sampling distance. In clinical CT, however, the ray is not much thicker than the distance betw</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>41 (2), Art.

Here we present an RNA-based method to identify RNP components using a modified streptavidin (SA)-binding RNA aptamer termed S1m. By optimizing the RNA aptamer S1 in structure and repeat conformation, we improved its affinity for SA and found a 4-fold repeat of S1m (4xS1m) to be more efficient than the established MS2 and PP7 systems from bacteriophages. We then attached the AU-rich element (ARE) of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), a well-known RNA motif that induces mRNA degradation, via 4xS1m to a SA matrix, and used the resulting RNA affinity column to purify ARE-binding proteins (BPs) from cellular extracts. By quantitative mass spectrometry using differential dimethyl labeling, we identified the majority of established ARE-BPs and detected several RNA-BPs that had previously not been associated with AREs. For two of these proteins, Rbms1 and Roxan, we confirmed specific binding to the TNFalpha ARE. The optimized 4xS1m aptamer, therefore, provides a powerful tool for the discovery of mRNP components in a single affinity purification step.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>42 (2), e13-</Feld596><PubVol>42</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>e13</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Leppek K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Stoecklin G" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24157833</PMID><DOI>10.1093/nar/gkt956</DOI><KST>A200</KST><KEYWORD>AFFINITY PURIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROCESSING-BODIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RIBONUCLEIC-ACID</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COAT PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>C-MYC GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>noncoding RNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>QUANTITATIVE PROTEOMICS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AU-RICH ELEMENTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLOBAL ANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MESSENGER-RNA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48651</publishedID><Artikel>Body mass index and leukocyte telomere length in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis</Artikel><Journal>Obesity Reviews</Journal><ABSTr>The objective of this study was to provide a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and leukocyte telomere length (LTL). Relevant studies were identified by a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Knowledge databases. Pooled correlation and regression coefficients were calculated using meta-analysis methods for both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Studies without suitable data for meta-analysis were summarized separately. Overall, 29 studies were included, of which 16 were eligible for meta-analysis, including two longitudinal studies. The majority of studies reported an inverse relationship between BMI and telomere length. For cross-sectional studies, the pooled estimates for correlation and regression coefficients were -0.057 (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.102 to -0.012) and -0.008 kBP kg m(-2) (95% CI: -0.016 to 0.000), respectively. The two longitudinal studies were small (70 and 311 subjects), covered different age ranges and yielded inconsistent results. No evidence of any gender difference was observed. Despite some variation between studies and very limited data from longitudinal studies, the results of this meta-analysis suggest a biologically plausible inverse association between BMI and LTL in adults. However, the associations require clarification, in particular by large longitudinal studies with careful control for possible confounding factors in overall, age- and sex-specific analyses.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>15 (3), 192-201</Feld596><PubVol>15</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>192</StrtPage><EndPage>201</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Muezzinler A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Zaineddin AK" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24165286</PMID><DOI>10.1111/obr.12126</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>RISK-FACTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CIGARETTE-SMOKING</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OXIDATIVE STRESS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIFE-STYLE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>UNITED-STATES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER-RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INSULIN-RESISTANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WEIGHT-GAIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SHORTER TELOMERES</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48652</publishedID><Artikel>Educational level, prevalence of hysterectomy, and age at amenorrhoea: a cross-sectional analysis of 9536 women from six population-based cohort studies in Germany</Artikel><Journal>BMC Women's Health</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Hysterectomy prevalence has been shown to vary by education level. Hysterectomy influences age at amenorrhoea. The aim of this study was to examine these associations in Germany within population-based data sets. METHODS: Baseline assessments in six population-based cohorts took place from 1997 through 2006 and included 9,548 women aged 20-84 years. All studies assessed hysterectomy history, school and professional degrees. Degrees were categorized into three levels each. Adjusted prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated. RESULTS: Prevalences were higher in West Germany than East Germany, increased by age, and leveled off starting at 55-64 years. The age- and study-adjusted prevalence ratio (lowest versus highest school level) was 2.61 (95% CI: 1.28-5.30), 1.48 (95% CI: 1.21-1.81), and 1.01 (95% CI: 0.80-1.28) for women aged 20-45, 45-64, and 65 and more years respectively. The estimated adjusted prevalence ratios per one unit decrement of the educational qualification score (range 1 = lowest, 8 = highest) were 1.29 (95% CI: 1.02-1.64), 1.08 (95% CI: 1.04-1.12), and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.93-1.03) for women aged 20-44, 45-64, and 65-84 years respectively. Age at amenorrhoea was on average 6.2 years lower (43.5 years versus 49.7 years) among women with a history of hysterectomy than those without. CONCLUSIONS: Lower educational level was associated with a higher hysterectomy prevalence among women aged 20-64 years. Several mediators associated with educational level and hysterectomy including women's disease risk, women's treatment preference, and women's access to uterus-preserving treatment may explain this association. At population level, hysterectomy decreases the age of amenorrhoea on average by 6.2 years.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>14 (), Art.

Exact geometrical definition of the treatment zone, however, is mandatory for acute treatment control since incomplete tumor coverage results in limited oncological outcome. In this study, the "Chebyshev Center Concept" was introduced for CT 3d rendering to assess size and position of the maximum treatable tumor at a specific safety margin. METHODS: In seven pig livers, three different IRE protocols were applied to create treatment zones of different size and shape: Protocol 1 (n = 5 IREs), Protocol 2 (n = 5 IREs), and Protocol 3 (n = 5 IREs). Contrast-enhanced CT was used to assess the treatment zones. Technique A consisted of a semi-automated software prototype for CT 3d rendering with the "Chebyshev Center Concept" implemented (the "Chebyshev Center" is the center of the largest inscribed sphere within the treatment zone) with automated definition of parameters for size, shape and position. Technique B consisted of standard CT 3d analysis with manual definition of the same parameters but position. RESULTS: For Protocol 1 and 2, short diameter of the treatment zone and diameter of the largest inscribed sphere within the treatment zone were not significantly different between Technique A and B. For Protocol 3, short diameter of the treatment zone and diameter of the largest inscribed sphere within the treatment zone were significantly smaller for Technique A compared with Technique B (41.1 +/- 13.1 mm versus 53.8 +/- 1.1 mm and 39.0 +/- 8.4 mm versus 53.8 +/- 1.1 mm; p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.01). For Protocol 1, 2 and 3, sphericity of the treatment zone was significantly larger for Technique A compared with B. CONCLUSIONS: Regarding size and shape of the treatment zone after IRE, CT 3d rendering with the "Chebyshev Center Concept" implemented provides significantly different results compared with standard CT 3d analysis. Since the latter overestimates the size of the treatment zone, the "Chebyshev Center Concept" could be used for a more objective acute treatment control.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>14 (), Art.

Cancer cell migration is a result of the concerted action of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), expressed by cancer cells to degrade the surrounding matrix, and integrins, the transmembrane receptors responsible for cell binding to matrix proteins. While it is known that cell-microenvironment interactions are essential for migration, the role of the physical state of such interactions remains still unclear. In this study we investigated human fibrosarcoma cell migration in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) fibronectin (FN) microenvironments. By using antibody blocking approach and cell-binding site mutation, we determined that -integrin is the main mediator of fibrosarcoma cell migration in 2D FN, whereas in 3D fibrillar FN, the binding of - and -integrins is not necessary for cell movement in the fibrillar network. Furthermore, while the general inhibition of MMPs with GM6001 has no effect on cell migration in both 2D and 3D FN matrices, we observed opposing effect after targeted silencing of a membrane-bound MMP, namely MT1-MMP. In 2D fibronectin, silencing of MT1-MMP results in decreased migration speed and loss of directionality, whereas in 3D FN matrices, cell migration speed is increased and integrin-mediated signaling for actin dynamics is promoted. Our results suggest that the fibrillar nature of the matrix governs the migratory behavior of fibrosarcoma cells. Therefore, to hinder migration and dissemination of diseased cells, matrix molecules should be directly targeted, rather than specific subtypes of receptors at the cell membrane.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>53 (3), 499-510</Feld596><PubVol>53</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>499</StrtPage><EndPage>510</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Corall,S."

Such cycles, for which there are many variants, are widespread in protozoa, plants and animals. Endocycling cells can achieve ploidies of &gt;200,000 C (chromatin-value); this increase in genomic DNA content allows a higher genomic output, which can facilitate the construction of very large cells or enhance macromolecular secretion. These cells execute normal S phases, using a G1-S regulatory apparatus similar to the one used by mitotic cells, but their capability to segregate chromosomes has been suppressed, typically by downregulation of mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase activity. Endocycles probably evolved many times, and the various endocycle mechanisms found in nature highlight the versatility of the cell cycle control machinery.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>15 (3), 197-210</Feld596><PubVol>15</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>197</StrtPage><EndPage>210</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Edgar BA" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Zielke N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Gutierrez C" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24556841</PMID><DOI>10.1038/nrm3756</DOI><KST>A220</KST><KEYWORD>TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>S-PHASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA-REPLICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DROSOPHILA FOLLICLE CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TROPHOBLAST GIANT-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CYCLIN-E LEVELS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA TRICHOMES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REGENERATING RAT LIVER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>A-TYPE CYCLIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DEPENDENT KINASE INHIBITOR</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48767</publishedID><Artikel>Cilengitide treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients does not alter patterns of progression</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Neuro-Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>The integrin antagonist cilengitide has been explored as an adjunct with anti-angiogenic properties to standard of care temozolomide chemoradiotherapy (TMZ/RT --&gt; TMZ) in newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Preclinical data as well as anecdotal clinical observations indicate that anti-angiogenic treatment may result in altered patterns of tumor progression. Using a standardized approach, we analyzed patterns of progression on MRI in 21 patients enrolled onto a phase 2 trial of cilengitide added to TMZ/RT --&gt; TMZ in newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Thirty patients from the experimental treatment arm of the EORTC/NCIC pivotal TMZ trial served as a reference. MRIcro software was used to map location and extent of initial preoperative and recurrent tumors on MRI of both groups into the same stereotaxic space which were then analyzed using an automated tool of image analysis. Clinical and outcome data of the cilengitide-treated patients were similar to those of the EORTC/NCIC trial except for a higher proportion of patients with a methylated O(6)-methylguanyl-DNA-methyltransferase gene promoter. Analysis of recurrence pattern revealed neither a difference in the size of the recurrent tumor nor in the distance of the recurrences from the preoperative tumor location between groups. Overall frequencies of distant recurrences were 20 % in the reference group and 19 % (4/21 patients) in the cilengitide group. Compared with TMZ/RT --&gt; TMZ alone, the addition of cilengitide does not alter patterns of progression. This analysis does not support concerns that integrin antagonism by cilengitide may induce a more aggressive phenotype at progression, but also provides no evidence for an anti-invasive activity of cilengitide in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>117 (1), 141-145</Feld596><PubVol>117</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>141</StrtPage><EndPage>145</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Eisele G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Wick A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Eisele AC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Clement PM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Tonn J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Tabatabai G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Ochsenbein A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Schlegel U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Neyns B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Krex D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Simon M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Nikkhah G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Picard M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Stupp R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Wick W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Weller M" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24442484</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s11060-014-1365-x</DOI><KST>G370</KST><KST>L401</KST><KST>L701</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>cell invasion</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>temozolomide</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>radiotherapy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THERAPY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48768</publishedID><Artikel>Genome-wide association study identifies multiple loci associated with bladder cancer risk</Artikel><Journal>Human Molecular Genetics</Journal><ABSTr>Candidate gene and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 11 independent susceptibility loci associated with bladder cancer risk. To discover additional risk variants, we conducted a new GWAS of 2422 bladder cancer cases and 5751 controls, followed by a meta-analysis with two independently published bladder cancer GWAS, resulting in a combined analysis of 6911 cases and 11 814 controls of European descent. TaqMan genotyping of 13 promising single nucleotide polymorphisms with P &lt; 1 x 10(-5) was pursued in a follow-up set of 801 cases and 1307 controls. Two new loci achieved genome-wide statistical significance: rs10936599 on 3q26.2 (P = 4.53 x 10(-9)) and rs907611 on 11p15.5 (P = 4.11 x 10(-8)). Two notable loci were also identified that approached genome-wide statistical significance: rs6104690 on 20p12.2 (P = 7.13 x 10(-7)) and rs4510656 on 6p22.3 (P = 6.98 x 10(-7)); these require further studies for confirmation. In conclusion, our study has identified new susceptibility alleles for bladder cancer risk that require fine-mapping and laboratory investigation, which could further understanding into the biological underpinnings of bladder carcinogenesis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (5), 1387-1398</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>1387</StrtPage><EndPage>1398</EndPage><Author

target genes</Artikel><Journal>Clinical Cancer Research</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: Cancer cell phenotypes are partially determined by epigenetic specifications, such as DNA methylation. Metastasis development is a late event in cancerogenesis and might be associated with epigenetic alterations. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: An in vivo selection approach was used to generate highly aggressive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines (A549 and HTB56) followed by genome-wide DNA methylation analysis. Furthermore, the therapeutic effects of the epigenetic agent azacytidine on DNA methylation patterns and the in vivo phenotypes were explored. RESULTS: Widespread changes of DNA methylation were observed during development of highly aggressive cell lines. Up to 2.5% of the CpG-rich region was differentially methylated as identified by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing compared with the less aggressive parental cell lines. DNA methyltransferase inhibition by azacytidine reversed the prometastatic phenotype; this was highly associated with the preferential loss of DNA methylation at sites that were hypermethylated during the in vivo selection. Of note, polycomb (PRC2) binding sites were particularly affected by DNA methylation changes after azacytidine exposure that persisted over time. CONCLUSIONS: We could show that metastatic capability of NSCLC is closely associated with DNA methylome alterations. Because inhibition of DNA methyltransferase reversed metastasis-prone phenotype, epigenetic modulation seems to be a potential therapeutic approach to prevent metastasis formation.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients with CLL who were referred for evaluation of alloSCT within a 7-year time frame and had a donor search indication according to the EBMT criteria or because of Richter's transformation were included. Patients for whom a matched donor could be found within 3 months (matches) were compared with patients without such a donor (controls). Primary end point was overall survival measured from the 3-month landmark after search initiation. RESULTS: Of 105 patients with donor search, 97 (matches 83; controls 14) were assessable at the 3-month landmark. Matches and controls were comparable for age, gender, time from diagnosis, number of previous regimens, and remission status. Disregarding if alloSCT was actually carried out or not, survival from the 3-month landmark was significantly better in matches versus controls [hazard ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17-0.85; P = 0.014]. The survival benefit of matches remained significant on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: This study provides first comparative evidence that alloSCT may have the potential to improve the natural course of poor-risk CLL as defined by the EBMT criteria.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>25 (1), 200-206</Feld596><PubVol>25</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>200</StrtPage><EndPage>206</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Herth I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Dietrich S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Benner A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Hegenbart U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Rieger M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Stadtherr P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Bondong A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Tran TH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Weide R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Hensel M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Knauf W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Franz-Werner J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Welslau M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Procaccianti M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Gorner M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Meissner J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Luft T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Schoenland S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Witzens-Harig M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Zenz T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="20" name="Ho AD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Dreger P" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24356631</PMID><DOI>10.1093/annonc/mdt511</DOI><KST>C060</KST><KST>G100</KST><KEYWORD>THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRIAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GUIDELINES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>fludarabine</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TERM-FOLLOW-UP</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>rituximab</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REFRACTORY CLL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>1ST COMPLETE REMISSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REGIMEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALEMTUZUMAB</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48771</publishedID><Artikel>Toward biocompatible nuclear hyperpolarization using signal amplification by reversible exchange: quantitative in situ spectroscopy and high-field imaging</Artikel><Journal>Analytical Chemistry</Journal><ABSTr>Signal amplification by reversible exchange (SABRE) of a substrate and parahydrogen at a catalytic center promises to overcome the inherent insensitivity of magnetic resonance. In order to apply the new approach to biomedical applications, there is a need to develop experimental equipment, in situ quantification methods, and a biocompatible solvent. We present results detailing a low-field SABRE polarizer which provides well-controlled experimental conditions, defined spins manipulations, and which allows in situ detection of thermally polarized and hyperpolarized samples. We introduce a method for absolute quantification of hyperpolarization yield in situ by means of a thermally polarized reference. A maximum signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 10(3) for 148 mumol of substance, a signal enhancement of 10(6) with respect to polarization transfer field of SABRE, or an absolute (1)H-polarization level of approximately 10(-2) is achieved. In an important step toward biomedical application, we demonstrate (1)H in situ NMR as well as (1)H and (13)C high-field MRI using hyperpolarized pyridine (d3) and (13)C nicotinamide in pure and 11% ethanol in aqueous solution.

Navigation systems have the potential to improve information on the exact position of intrahepatic tumors, and thus facilitate oncological resection. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of a commercially available augmented reality (AR) guidance system employing intraoperative robotic C-arm cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) for laparoscopic liver surgery. METHODS: A human liver-like phantom with 16 target fiducials was used to evaluate the Syngo iPilot((R)) AR system. Subsequently, the system was used for the laparoscopic resection of a hepatocellular carcinoma in segment 7 of a 50-year-old male patient. RESULTS: In the phantom experiment, the AR system showed a mean target registration error of 0.96 +/- 0.52 mm, with a maximum error of 2.49 mm. The patient successfully underwent the operation and showed no postoperative complications. CONCLUSION: The use of intraoperative CBCT and AR for laparoscopic liver resection is feasible and could be considered an option for future liver surgery in complex cases.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>28 (3), 933-940</Feld596><PubVol>28</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>933</StrtPage><EndPage>940</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kenngott HG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Wagner M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Gondan M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Nickel F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Nolden M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Fetzer A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Weitz J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Fischer L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Speidel S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Meinzer HP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Boeckler D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Buechler MW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Mueller-Stich BP" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24178862</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00464-013-3249-0</DOI><KST>E130</KST><KEYWORD>MODEL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>navigation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>augmented reality</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Nephrectomy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BEAM COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48774</publishedID><Artikel>Plasma alkylresorcinols, biomarkers of whole-grain wheat and rye intake, and incidence of colorectal cancer</Artikel><Journal>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Few studies have investigated the association between whole-grain intake and colorectal cancer. Because whole-grain intake estimation might be prone to measurement errors, more objective measures (eg, biomarkers) could assist in investigating such associations. METHODS: The association between alkylresorcinols, biomarkers of whole-grain rye and wheat intake, and colorectal cancer incidence were investigated using prediagnostic plasma samples from colorectal cancer case patients and matched control subjects nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition. We included 1372 incident colorectal cancer case patients and 1372 individual matched control subjects and calculated the incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for overall and anatomical subsites of colorectal cancer using conditional logistic regression adjusted for potential confounders. Regional differences (Scandinavia, the Mediterranean, Central Europe) were also explored. RESULTS: High plasma total alkylresorcinol concentration was associated with lower incidence of distal colon cancer; the adjusted incidence rate ratio of distal colon cancer for the highest vs lowest quartile of plasma total alkylresorcinols was 0.48 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.28 to 0.83). An inverse association between plasma total alkylresorcinol concentrations and colon cancer was found for Scandinavian participants (IRR per doubling = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.70 to 0.98). However, plasma total alkylresorcinol concentrations were not associated with overall colorectal cancer, proximal colon cancer, or rectal cancer. Plasma alkylresorcinols concentrations were associated with colon and distal colon cancer only in Central Europe and Scandinavia (ie, areas where alkylresorcinol levels were higher). CONCLUSIONS: High concentrations of plasma alkylresorcinols were associated with a lower incidence of distal colon cancer but not with overall colorectal cancer, proximal colon cancer, and rectal cancer.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>106 (1), djt352-</Feld596><PubVol>106</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>djt352</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Kyro C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Olsen A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Landberg R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Skeie G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Loft S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Aman P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Leenders M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Dik VK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Siersema PD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Pischon T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Christensen J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Boutron-Ruault MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Fagherazzi G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Cottet V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Kuhn T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Chang-Claude J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="17" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Bamia C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Trichopoulos D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Palli D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Krogh V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Vineis P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Panico S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Peeters PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Bakken T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Asli LA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Arguelles M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Jakszyn P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Sanchez MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Amiano P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Huerta JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Barricarte A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Ljuslinder I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Palmqvist R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Wareham N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Key TJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Travis RC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Ferrari P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Freisling H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="44" name="Jenab M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="45" name="Gunter MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="46" name="Murphy N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="47" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="48" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="49" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24317181</PMID><DOI>10.1093/jnci/djt352</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>dietary fiber</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PRODUCTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COHORT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTERVENTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REPRODUCIBILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLON-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEALTH</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48775</publishedID><Artikel>Primary preventive potential of major lifestyle risk factors for acute myocardial infarction in men: an analysis of the EPIC-Heidelberg cohort</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Epidemiology</Journal><ABSTr>The aim of this study was to assess the preventive potential of major lifestyle risk factors for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in middle-aged men. Among 10,981 men in the Heidelberg cohort of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition, aged 40.2-65.8 years when recruited, 378 developed first-ever AMI during a median follow-up period of 11.4 years. Current smoking, excess body weight, being physically inactive, but not high alcohol consumption, were identified as the major lifestyle risk factors for AMI using Cox regression analysis. A competing AMI risk model built from cause-specific Cox regression models and considering the risk of death predicted 353 AMI cases, 182 (51.6 %) of which were estimated as preventable through adherence to a healthy lifestyle profile (never smoking, normal body weight, physically active, and moderate alcohol consumption). The calculated age-specific 5-year incidence rates for AMI in the actual cohort and in a hypothetical, comparable cohort with all men following the healthy lifestyle profile were 128 and 39, respectively, per 100,000 person-years for the age group 40-44, increasing to 468 and 307 per 100,000 person-years for the age group 65-69. The estimated AMI incidence rates for men with the healthy lifestyle profile are still somewhat higher than the average rates reported for documented low-incidence regions, such as parts of Japan. Our analysis confirms the strong primary preventive potential for AMI based on avoidance of smoking and excess body weight, and on regular physical activity.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>29 (1), 27-34</Feld596><PubVol>29</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>27</StrtPage><EndPage>34</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Li K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Monni S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Huesing A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Wendt A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kneisel J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Gross ML" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Kaaks R" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24399287</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s10654-013-9872-1</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>ALCOHOL-CONSUMPTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TIME PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RELATIVE VALIDITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>dietary patterns</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CASE-FATALITY RATES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>52 COUNTRIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANGINA-PECTORIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GERMAN HEALTH INTERVIEW</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48776</publishedID><Artikel>[Cancer of unknown primary : Epidemiology and pathogenesis]</Artikel><Journal>Radiologe</Journal><ABSTr>DEFINITION: The term cancer of unknown primary (CUP) describes by definition epithelial malignancies for which no primary tumor can be found after primary diagnostics have been performed. EPIDEMIOLOGY: The CUP syndrome constitutes 2-3% of all fatal cases of malignancies in both men and women. The proportion of women has increased in parallel to the increase of tobacco consumption in women. PATHOGENESIS: The most frequent origin appears to lie in the lungs or upper abdominal organs, while notable differences can be found between older autopsy findings and recent gene expression data with respect to identified primary tumors or tissue assignation. The fact that a primary tumor cannot be identified is probably based on various reasons: a complete regression of a primary tumor in isolated cases seems to be just as plausible as the misclassification of a primary tumor as a metastasis. CONCLUSION: In combination with the fact that a primary tumor cannot be identified by autopsy in more than 20 % of cases, the important conclusion can be drawn that curative approaches seem appropriate for localized CUP cases.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>54 (2), 107-111</Feld596><PubVol>54</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>107</StrtPage><EndPage>111</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Loeffler H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Neben K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kraemer A" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24435156</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00117-013-2544-z</DOI><KST>G330</KST><KEYWORD>GENE MUTATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PRIMARY SITE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PRIMARY TUMORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SOLID TUMORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GEMCITABINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>paclitaxel</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>protein expression</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ORIGIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHASE-II</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>carcinoma</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48777</publishedID><Artikel>Pulsed Acoustic Cellular Expression (PACE) Reduces Capsule Formation Around Silicone Implants</Artikel><Journal>Aesthetic Plastic Surgery</Journal><ABSTr>Capsular contracture remains a major complication after reconstructive or aesthetic breast augmentation. Formation of capsular fibrosis is a multifactorial process. An initial inflammatory reaction appears to be key to the development of capsular contracture. Recent studies have shown that pulsed acoustic cellular expression (PACE) has significant antiinflammatory effects. Thus, this study aimed to determine the potential of PACE to prevent or attenuate capsular contracture around silicone implants in a rodent model. For this study, 36 Lewis rats were divided into two groups, and a textured silicone implant was placed in a dorsal submuscular pocket. One group received PACE treatment, whereas the other group served as the control group and received no treatment. Follow-up evaluations were performed after 10, 35, and 100 days. Capsule thickness, collagen density, myofibroblasts, vascular density, and a semiquantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction that addressed differential gene expression were assessed. The PACE treatment significantly reduced capsule thickness on days 10, 35, and 100 compared with the control group (day 10: 632.9 +/- 164.5 vs 932.6 +/- 160.8, p &lt; 0.05; day 35: 709.5 +/- 175 vs 825.9 +/- 313.3, p &lt; 0.0.5; day 100: 736.3 +/- 198.1 vs 1,062.3 +/- 151.9, p &lt; 0.05). This was accompanied by a significant suppression of proinflammatory genes (cluster of differentiation 68, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, CCL4) and synergistic alterations of pro- and antifibrotic proteins (transforming growth factor-beta 1, matrix metalloproteinase-2). This study showed that the PACE application significantly reduces capsular contracture around silicone implants. A decrease in capsular thickness after PACE treatment seems to be associated with a downregulation of proinflammatory genes and proteins. The study identifies PACE technology as a potential low-cost technique that is easy to use for reduction of capsular contracture after augmentation using silicone implants.

We examined adolescents in the early stages of BPD to provide a unique opportunity to investigate which parts of the brain are initially affected by the disorder before confounding factors such as long-term medication or chronicity can mask them. A group of 60 right-handed female adolescents between 14 and 18 years of age (20 patients with BPD, 20 clinical controls, and 20 healthy controls) underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Focus was on the examination of hippocampal and amygdalar volume differences. Furthermore, a cortical thickness analysis was conducted. FreeSurfer software detected significant group differences in the right and left hippocampus and in the right amygdala. Additionally, significant volume reductions in frontal (right middle frontal gyrus, orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus bilaterally), and parietal regions (superior parietal gyrus bilaterally) were found in adolescents with BPD compared with controls. No group differences in cortical thickness were revealed.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>221 (3), 179-186</Feld596><PubVol>221</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>179</StrtPage><EndPage>186</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Richter J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Brunner R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Parzer P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Resch F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Stieltjes B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Henze R" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24503371</PMID><DOI>10.1010/j.pscychresns.2014.01.</DOI><KST>E010</KST><KST>E011</KST><KEYWORD>HIPPOCAMPAL VOLUMES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MORPHOMETRIC MRI</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AMYGDALA VOLUME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN-BRAIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VOXEL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METAANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THICKNESS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WHITE-MATTER</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48780</publishedID><Artikel>Towards optimizing the sequence of bevacizumab and nitrosoureas in recurrent malignant glioma</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Neuro-Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>Studies on the monoclonal VEGF-A antibody bevacizumab gave raise to questions regarding the lack of an overall survival benefit, the optimal timing in the disease course and potential combination and salvage therapies. We retrospectively assessed survival, radiological progression type on bevacizumab and efficacy of salvage therapies in 42 patients with recurrent malignant gliomas who received bevacizumab and nitrosourea sequentially. 15 patients received bevacizumab followed by nitrosourea at progression and 27 patients vice versa. Time to treatment failure, defined as time from initiation of one to failure of the other treatment, was similar in both groups (9.6 vs. 9.2 months, log rank p = 0.19). Progression-free survival on nitrosoureas was comparable in both groups, while progression-free survival on bevacizumab was longer in the group receiving bevacizumab first (5.3 vs. 4.1 months, log rank p = 0.03). Survival times were similar for patients with grade III (n = 9) and grade IV (n = 33) tumors. Progression-free survival on bevacizumab for patients developing contrast-enhancing T1 progression was longer than for patients who displayed a non-enhancing T2 progression. However, post-progression survival times after bevacizumab failure were not different. Earlier treatment with bevacizumab was not associated with better outcome in this series. The fact that earlier as compared to later bevacizumab treatment does not result in a different time to treatment failure highlights the challenge for first-line or recurrence trials with bevacizumab to demonstrate an overall survival benefit if crossover of bevacizumab-naive patients after progression occurs.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>117 (1), 85-92</Feld596><PubVol>117</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>85</StrtPage><EndPage>92</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Wiestler B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Radbruch A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Osswald M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Combs SE" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Jungk C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Winkler F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Bendszus M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Unterberg A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Platten M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Wick W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Wick A" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24458956</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s11060-013-1356-3</DOI><KST>E010</KST><KST>G370</KST><KST>G160</KST><KST>L101</KST><KST>E012</KST><KEYWORD>PATTERNS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>chemotherapy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PLUS IRINOTECAN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HIGH-GRADE GLIOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>temozolomide</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLIOBLASTOMA-MULTIFORME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHASE-3 TRIAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTEGRATED GENOMIC ANALYSIS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48781</publishedID><Artikel>Multivariate regression approaches for surrogate-based diffeomorphic estimation of respiratory motion in radiation therapy</Artikel><Journal>Physics in Medicine and Biology</Journal><ABSTr>Breathing-induced location uncertainties of internal structures are still a relevant issue in the radiation therapy of thoracic and abdominal tumours. Motion compensation approaches like gating or tumour tracking are usually driven by low-dimensional breathing signals, which are acquired in real-time during the treatment. These signals are only surrogates of the internal motion of target structures and organs at risk, and, consequently, appropriate models are needed to establish correspondence between the acquired signals and the sought internal motion patterns. In this work, we present a diffeomorphic framework for correspondence modelling based on the Log-Euclidean framework and multivariate regression. Within the framework, we systematically compare standard and subspace regression approaches (principal component regression, partial least squares, canonical correlation analysis) for different types of common breathing signals (1D: spirometry, abdominal belt, diaphragm tracking; multi-dimensional: skin surface tracking). Experiments are based on 4D CT and 4D MRI data sets and cover intra- and inter-cycle as well as intra- and inter-session motion variations. Only small differences in internal motion estimation accuracy are observed between the 1D surrogates. Increasing the surrogate dimensionality, however, improved the accuracy significantly; this is shown for both 2D signals, which consist of a common 1D signal and its time derivative, and high-dimensional signals containing the motion of many skin surface points. Eventually, comparing the standard and subspace regression variants when applied to the high-dimensional breathing signals, only small differences in terms of motion estimation accuracy are found.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>59 (5), 1147-1164</Feld596><PubVol>59</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>1147</StrtPage><EndPage>1164</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Wilms M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Werner R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Ehrhardt J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schmidt-Richberg A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schlemmer HP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Handels H" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24557007</PMID><DOI>10.1088/0031-9155/59/5/1147</DOI><KST>E010</KST><KEYWORD>SETS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FRAMEWORK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MODELS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMAGE REGISTRATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECONSTRUCTION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48808</publishedID><Artikel>Qualitätssicherung in der Routine ist notwendig und gut realisierbar</Artikel><Journal>Deutsches Aerzteblatt</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>19 (), 842-843</Feld596><PubVol>19</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>842</StrtPage><EndPage>843</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Hoffmeister M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Stock C" IsDKFZ="0"/><KST>C070</KST></row><row><publishedID>48811</publishedID><Artikel>Impact of human papilloma virus infection on the response of head and neck cancers to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody therapy</Artikel><Journal>Cell Death and Disease</Journal><ABSTr>Infection with human papillomaviruses (HPVs) characterizes a distinct subset of head and neck squamous cell cancers (HNSCCs). HPV-positive HNSCC preferentially affect the oropharynx and tonsils. Localized HPV-positive HNSCCs have a favorable prognosis and treatment outcome. However, the impact of HPV in advanced or metastatic HNSCC remains to be defined. In particular, it is unclear whether HPV modulates the response to cetuximab, an antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is a mainstay of treatment of advanced HNSCC. To this end, we have examined the sensitivity of HPV-positive and -negative HNSCC models to cetuximab and cytotoxic drugs in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we have stably expressed the HPV oncogenes E6 and E7 in cetuximab-sensitive cancer cell lines to specifically investigate their role in the antibody response. The endogenous HPV status or the expression of HPV oncogenes had no significant impact on cetuximab-mediated suppression of EGFR signaling and proliferation in vitro. Cetuximab effectively inhibited the growth of E6- and E7-expressing tumors grafted in NOD/SCID mice. In support, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples from cetuximab-treated patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC were probed for p16(INK4a) expression, an established biomarker of HPV infection. Response rates (45.5% versus 45.5%) and median progression-free survival (97 versus 92 days) following cetuximab-based therapy were similar in patients with p16(INK4A)-positive and p16(INK4A)-negative tumors. In conclusion, HPV oncogenes do not modulate the anti-EGFR antibody response in HSNCC. Cetuximab treatment should be administered independently of HPV status.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>5 (), e1091-</Feld596><PubVol>5</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>e1091</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Pogorzelski M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Ting S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Gauler TC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Breitenbuecher F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Vossebein I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hoffarth S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Markowetz J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Lang S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Bergmann C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Brandau S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Jawad JA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Schmid KW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Schuler M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Kasper S" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24577089</PMID><DOI>10.1038/cddis.2014.62</DOI><KST>L401</KST><KEYWORD>RANDOMIZED-TRIAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CISPLATIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SQUAMOUS-CELL CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>chemotherapy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TYPE-16</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>P16</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>oropharyngeal cancer</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OPEN-LABEL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PLUS CETUXIMAB</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48816</publishedID><Artikel>Targeted therapies in gastroesophageal cancer</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Gastroesophageal cancers comprising gastric cancer (GC), and cancers of the distal oesophagus and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) are a global health threat. In Western populations the incidence of GC is declining which has been attributed to effective strategies of eradicating Helicobacter pylori infection. To the contrary, GEJ cancers are on the rise, with obesity and reflux disease being viewed as major risk factors. During the past decade perioperative chemotherapy, pre- or postoperative radio-chemotherapy, and, in Asian populations, adjuvant chemotherapy have been shown to improve the outcome of patients with advanced GC and GEJ cancers suited for surgery. Less progress has been made in the treatment of metastatic disease. The introduction of trastuzumab in combination with platinum/fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy for patients with HER2-positive disease has marked a turning point. Recently, several novel agents targeting growth factor receptors, angiogenic pathways, adhesion molecules and mediators of intracellular signal transduction have been clinically explored.

Thymosin beta 4 gene silencing promotes differentiation of neural stem cells whereas thymosin beta 4 overexpression initiates cortical folding of developing brain hemispheres. A role of thymosin beta 4 in malignant gliomas has not yet been investigated. We analysed thymosin beta 4 staining on tissue microarrays and performed interrogations of the REMBRANDT and the Cancer Genome Atlas databases. We investigated thymosin beta 4 expression in seven established glioma cell lines and seven glioma-initiating cell lines and induced or silenced thymosin beta 4 expression by lentiviral transduction in LNT-229, U87MG and GS-2 cells to study the effects of altered thymosin beta 4 expression on gene expression, growth, clonogenicity, migration, invasion, self-renewal and differentiation capacity in vitro, and tumorigenicity in vivo. Thymosin beta 4 expression increased with grade of malignancy in gliomas. Thymosin beta 4 gene silencing in LNT-229 and U87MG glioma cells inhibited migration and invasion, promoted starvation-induced cell death in vitro and enhanced survival of glioma-bearing mice. Thymosin beta 4 gene silencing in GS-2 cells inhibited self-renewal and promoted differentiation in vitro and decreased tumorigenicity in vivo. Gene expression analysis suggested a thymosin beta 4-dependent regulation of mesenchymal signature genes and modulation of TGFbeta and p53 signalling networks. We conclude that thymosin beta 4 should be explored as a novel molecular target for anti-glioma therapy.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>137 (Pt 2), 433-448</Feld596><PubVol>137</PubVol><PubIss>Pt 2</PubIss><StrtPage>433</StrtPage><EndPage>448</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Wirsching HG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Krishnan S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Florea AM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Frei K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Krayenbuhl N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hasenbach K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Reifenberger G" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Weller M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Tabatabai G" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24355709</PMID><DOI>10.1093/brain/awt333</DOI><KST>L401</KST></row><row><publishedID>48825</publishedID><Artikel>Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells Predict Survival of Patients with Advanced Melanoma: Comparison with Regulatory T Cells and NY-ESO-1- or Melan-A-Specific T Cells</Artikel><Journal>Clinical Cancer Research</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: To analyze the prognostic relevance and relative impact of circulating myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T cells (Treg) compared with functional tumor antigen-specific T cells in patients with melanoma with distant metastasis. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The percentage of CD14(+)CD11b(+)HLA-DR(-/low) MDSCs, CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) Tregs, and the presence of NY-ESO-1- or Melan-A-specific T cells was analyzed in 94 patients and validated in an additional cohort of 39 patients by flow cytometry. Univariate survival differences were calculated according to Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests. Multivariate analyses were performed using Cox regression models. RESULTS: NY-ESO-1-specific T cells, the M-category, and the frequency of MDSCs were associated with survival. The absence of NY-ESO-1-specific T cells and the M-category M1c independently increased the risk of death. In a second Cox model not considering results on antigen-specific T cells, a frequency of &gt;11% MDSCs showed independent impact. Its association with survival was confirmed in the additional patient cohort. Median survival of patients with a lower frequency of MDSCs was 13 months versus 8 months for others (P &lt; 0.001, combined cohorts). We observed a strong correlation between high levels of MDSCs and the absence of melanoma antigen-specific T cells implying a causal and clinically relevant interaction. No prognostic impact was observed for Tregs. CONCLUSIONS: Circulating CD14(+)CD11b(+)HLA-DR(-/low) MDSCs have a negative impact on survival and inversely correlate with the presence of functional antigen-specific T cells in patients with advanced melanoma. Our findings provide a rationale to investigate MDSC-depleting strategies in the therapeutic setting especially in combination with vaccination or T-cell transfer approaches.

Given that a high mutation rate and lack of AIM2 expression was previously detected in a subset of colorectal cancers, we here investigated the association of AIM2 expression in tumor cells and patient prognosis (5-year follow-up). A tissue microarray analysis of 476 matched tissue pairs (colorectal tumor and adjacent normal colon epithelium) was performed by two independent observers. Samples from 62 patients were excluded because of missing follow-up information or due to neo-adjuvant therapy before tissue sampling. Out of the remaining 414 tissue pairs, 279 (67.4%) displayed reduced AIM2 expression in cancer cells when compared to epithelial cells of their normal counterpart. Thirty-eight patients (9.18%) had completely lost AIM2 expression in tumor cells. After adjustment for sex, age, cancer stage, tumor site, tumor grade and chemotherapy, complete lack of AIM2 expression was associated with an up to 3-fold increase in overall mortality (HR=2.40; 95% CI=1.44-3.99) and disease specific mortality (HR=3.14; 95% CI=1.75-5.65) in comparison to AIM2-positive tumor samples. Our results demonstrate that lack of AIM2 expression is closely associated with poor outcome in colorectal cancer. The data thus strongly substantiate a protective role of AIM2 against progression of colorectal tumors. Further studies are required to assess whether lack of AIM2 expression may be used as a biomarker for the identification of colorectal cancer patients with poor prognosis</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>135 (10), 2387-2396</Feld596><PubVol>135</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>2387</StrtPage><EndPage>2396</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Dihlmann S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Tao S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Echterdiek F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Herpel E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Jansen L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Chang-Claude J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Hoffmeister M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Kloor M" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24729378</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28891</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KST>C070</KST><KST>G105</KST><KEYWORD>tumor marker</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>microsatellite instability</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>chemotherapy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TARGET</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MODEL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>colon</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>prognosis</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INFLAMMASOME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>cancer prognosis</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>inflammation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>tissue microarray</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CYTOPLASMIC DNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DSDNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>interferon (IFN)</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48876</publishedID><Artikel>Mice with cardiac-restricted overexpression of Myozap are sensitized to biomechanical stress and develop a protein-aggregate associated cardiomyopathy</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology</Journal><ABSTr>The intercalated disc (ID) is a major component of the cell-cell contact structures of cardiomyocytes and has been recognized as a hot spot for cardiomyopathy. We have previously identified Myozap as a novel cardiac-enriched ID protein, which interacts with several other ID proteins and is involved in RhoA/SRF signaling in vitro. To now study its potential role in vivo we generated a mouse model with cardiac overexpression of Myozap. Transgenic (Tg) mice developed cardiomyopathy with hypertrophy and LV dilation. Consistently, these mice displayed upregulation of the hypertrophy-associated and SRF-dependent gene expression. Pressure overload (transverse aortic constriction, TAC) caused exaggerated cardiac hypertrophy, further loss of contractility and LV dilation. Similarly, a physiological stimulus (voluntary running) also led to significant LV dysfunction. On the ultrastructural level, Myozap-Tg mouse hearts exhibited massive protein aggregates composed of Myozap, desmoplakin and other ID proteins. This aggregate-associated pathology closely reserribled the alterations observed in desmin-related cardiomyopathy. Interestingly, desmin was not detectable in the aggregates, yet was largely displaced from the ID. Molecular analyses revealed induction of autophagy and dysregulation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), associated with apoptosis. Taken together, cardiac overexpression of Myozap leads to cardiomyopathy, mediated, at least in part by induction of Rho-dependent SRF signaling in vivo. Surprisingly, this phenotype was also accompanied by protein aggregates in cardiomyocytes, UPR alteration, accelerated autophagy and apoptosis. Thus, this mouse model may also offer additional insight into the pathogenesis of protein-aggregate-associated cardiomyopathies and represents a new candidate gene itself.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>72 (), 196-207</Feld596><PubVol>72</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>196</StrtPage><EndPage>207</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Frank,D."

Lung perfusion: The most established method is first-pass contrast-enhanced imaging with bolus injection of gadolinium chelates and time-resolved gradient-echo (GRE) sequences covering the whole lung (1 volume/s). Images are evaluated visually or semiquantitatively, while absolute quantification remains challenging due to the nonlinear relation of T1-shortening and contrast material concentration. Noncontrast-enhanced perfusion imaging is still experimental, either based on arterial spin labeling or Fourier decomposition. The latter is used to separate high- and low-frequency oscillations of lung signal related to the effects of pulsatile blood flow. Lung ventilation: Using contrast-enhanced first-pass perfusion, lung ventilation deficits are indirectly identified by hypoxic vasoconstriction. More direct but still experimental approaches use either inhalation of pure oxygen, an aerosolized contrast agent, or hyperpolarized noble gases. Fourier decomposition MRI based on the low-frequency lung signal oscillation allows for visualization of ventilation without any contrast agent. Respiratory mechanics: Time-resolved series with high background signal such as GRE or steady-state free precession visualize the movement of chest wall, diaphragm, mediastinum, lung tissue, tracheal wall, and tumor. The assessment of volume changes allows drawing conclusions on regional ventilation. With this arsenal of functional imaging capabilities at high spatial and temporal resolution but without radiation burden, MRI will find its role in regional functional lung analysis and will therefore overcome the sensitivity of global lung function analysis for repeated short-term treatment monitoring.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>35 (1), 74-82</Feld596><PubVol>35</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>74</StrtPage><EndPage>82</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Biederer J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Heussel CP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Puderbach M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Wielpuetz MO" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24481761</PMID><DOI>10.1055/s-0033-1363453</DOI><KST>E010</KST><KEYWORD>PULMONARY BLOOD-FLOW</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONTRAST-ENHANCED MRI</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PARTIAL LIQUID VENTILATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COPD PATIENTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RABBIT MODEL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>inversion-recovery</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>hyperpolarized He-3 MRI</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Fourier decomposition</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CYSTIC-FIBROSIS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48908</publishedID><Artikel>Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells delay expulsion of intestinal nematodes by suppression of IL-9-driven mast cell activation in BALB/c but not in C57BL/6 mice</Artikel><Journal>PloS Pathogens</Journal><ABSTr>Accumulating evidence suggests that IL-9-mediated immunity plays a fundamental role in control of intestinal nematode infection. Here we report a different impact of Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Treg) in nematode-induced evasion of IL-9-mediated immunity in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. Infection with Strongyloides ratti induced Treg expansion with similar kinetics and phenotype in both strains. Strikingly, Treg depletion reduced parasite burden selectively in BALB/c but not in C57BL/6 mice. Treg function was apparent in both strains as Treg depletion increased nematode-specific humoral and cellular Th2 response in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice to the same extent. Improved resistance in Treg-depleted BALB/c mice was accompanied by increased production of IL-9 and accelerated degranulation of mast cells. In contrast, IL-9 production was not significantly elevated and kinetics of mast cell degranulation were unaffected by Treg depletion in C57BL/6 mice. By in vivo neutralization, we demonstrate that increased IL-9 production during the first days of infection caused accelerated mast cell degranulation and rapid expulsion of S. ratti adults from the small intestine of Treg-depleted BALB/c mice. In genetically mast cell-deficient (Cpa3-Cre) BALB/c mice, Treg depletion still resulted in increased IL-9 production but resistance to S. ratti infection was lost, suggesting that IL-9-driven mast cell activation mediated accelerated expulsion of S. ratti in Treg-depleted BALB/c mice. This IL-9-driven mast cell degranulation is a central mechanism of S. ratti expulsion in both, BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, because IL-9 injection reduced and IL-9 neutralization increased parasite burden in the presence of Treg in both strains. Therefore our results suggest that Foxp3(+) Treg suppress sufficient IL-9 production for subsequent mast cell degranulation during S. ratti infection in a non-redundant manner in BALB/c mice, whereas additional regulatory pathways are functional in Treg-depleted C57BL/6 mice.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>10 (2), e1003913-</Feld596><PubVol>10</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>e1003913</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Blankenhaus B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Reitz M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Brenz Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Eschbach ML" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Hartmann W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Haben I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Sparwasser T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Huehn J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Kuhl A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Feyerabend TB" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Rodewald HR" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Breloer M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24516385</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.ppat.1003913</DOI><KST>D110</KST><KEYWORD>PROTECTIVE IMMUNITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SELF-TOLERANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STRONGYLOIDES-RATTI INFECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VENEZUELENSIS INFECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SELECTIVE DEPLETION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AIRWAY INFLAMMATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRICHURIS-MURIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WORM EXPULSION

PATIENTS AND METHODS: For 100 NSCLC patients who had received postoperative radiotherapy, overall, relapse-free and metastases-free survival was retrospectively analysed using Kaplan-Meier methods. The impact of tumour-, treatment- and patient-related cofactors on treatment outcome was evaluated in uni- and multivariate Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: No statistically significant difference between the survival curves of the groups with a short versus a long time interval between surgery and radiotherapy could be shown in uni- or multivariate analysis. Multivariate analysis revealed a significant decrease in overall survival times for patients with prolonged overall radiotherapy treatment times exceeding 42 days (16 vs. 36 months) and for patients with radiation-induced pneumonitis (8 vs. 29 months). CONCLUSION: Radiation-induced pneumonitis and prolonged radiation treatment times significantly reduced overall survival after adjuvant radiotherapy in NSCLC patients. The negative impact of a longer radiotherapy treatment time could be shown for the first time in an adjuvant setting. The hypothesis of a negative impact of longer waiting times prior to commencement of adjuvant radiotherapy could not be confirmed.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>190 (3), 263-269</Feld596><PubVol>190</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>263</StrtPage><EndPage>269</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Buetof R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Kirchner K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Appold S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Lock S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Rolle A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hoffken G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Krause M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Baumann M" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24413893</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00066-013-0501-4</DOI><KST>L301</KST><KEYWORD>NUDE-MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FRACTIONATED-IRRADIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LOCAL-CONTROL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACCELERATED RADIOTHERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONTROL PROBABILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR VOLUME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WAITING TIME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RADIATION ONCOLOGY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TREATMENT TIME</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48910</publishedID><Artikel>Physical performance and psychosocial status in lung cancer patients: results from a pilot study</Artikel><Journal>Oncology Research and Treatment</Journal><ABSTr>Background: The aim of this study was to assess the physical performance and psychosocial status of lung cancer patients. Patients and Methods: Patients with predominantly advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) were recruited. Muscle strength was assessed via hand-held dynamometry (HHD) and endurance capacity via the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), and results were compared to healthy reference values. Psychosocial status, lung cancer-specific symptoms, and quality of life (QoL) outcomes were evaluated. Results: 39 patients (NSCLC n = 22, SCLC n = 17) with predominantly advanced-stage disease and a median age of 62 years (range 44-83 years) were enrolled. Compared to a healthy reference population, mean muscle strength values of upper (elbow flexion -28.2% (+/-17.5), elbow extension -12.4% (+/-11.1)) and lower (knee extension -47.6% (+/-19.3), hip abduction -44.9% (+/-14.9), hip flexion -13% (+/-24.2)) extremities, and 6MWT were lower (male/female: 434/411 m vs. 597/514 m). Lung cancer-specific symptoms and QoL were comparable to published data. Conclusion: Our results indicate that lung cancer patients experience muscular weakness, lower endurance performance, and decreased QoL compared to a healthy reference population. The feasibility and benefit of a structured exercise intervention in this specific population need to be evaluated, in particular its effect on psychosocial well-being. (c) 2014 S.

Creatine produces chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) contrast in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The proton transfer pathway from zwitterionic creatine to water is examined using a kinetic transition network constructed from the discrete path sampling approach and an approximate quantum-chemical energy function, employing the self-consistent-charge density-functional tight-binding (SCC-DFTB) method. The resulting potential energy surface is visualized by constructing disconnectivity graphs. The energy landscape consists of two distinct regions corresponding to the zwitterionic creatine structures and deprotonated creatine. The activation energy that characterizes the proton transfer from the creatine NH2 group to water was determined from an Arrhenius fit of rate constants as a function of temperature, obtained from harmonic transition state theory. The result is in reasonable agreement with values obtained in water exchange spectroscopy (WEX) experiments.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>118 (8), 1969-1975</Feld596><PubVol>118</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>1969</StrtPage><EndPage>1975</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ivchenko O" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Whittleston CS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Carr JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Imhof P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Goerke S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Bachert P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Wales DJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24476099</PMID><DOI>10.1021/jp410172k</DOI><KST>E020</KST><KEYWORD>TIGHT-BINDING METHOD</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMPLEX MATERIALS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FINDING SADDLE-POINTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSITION NETWORKS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CRYSTALLINE SILICON</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BIOLOGICAL INTEREST</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHEMICAL ENTITIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONFORMATIONAL-CHANGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ELASTIC BAND METHOD</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48915</publishedID><Artikel>Epigenomic alterations define lethal CIMP-positive ependymomas of infancy</Artikel><Journal>Nature</Journal><ABSTr>Ependymomas are common childhood brain tumours that occur throughout the nervous system, but are most common in the paediatric hindbrain. Current standard therapy comprises surgery and radiation, but not cytotoxic chemotherapy as it does not further increase survival. Whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing of 47 hindbrain ependymomas reveals an extremely low mutation rate, and zero significant recurrent somatic single nucleotide variants. Although devoid of recurrent single nucleotide variants and focal copy number aberrations, poor-prognosis hindbrain ependymomas exhibit a CpG island methylator phenotype. Transcriptional silencing driven by CpG methylation converges exclusively on targets of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 which represses expression of differentiation genes through trimethylation of H3K27. CpG island methylator phenotype-positive hindbrain ependymomas are responsive to clinical drugs that target either DNA or H3K27 methylation both in vitro and in vivo.

depletion leads to increased migration and upregulation of the chemoattractant secretoneurin in melanoma cells</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>During development and progression of malignant melanoma, an important role has been attributed to alterations of cell-cell adhesions, in particular, to a "cadherin switch" from E- to N-cadherin. We have previously shown that a subtype of melanoma cells express the desmosomal cadherin desmoglein 2 as non-junction-bound cell surface protein in addition to classical cadherins. To study the role of desmoglein 2 in melanoma cells, melanoma lines containing high endogenous amounts of desmoglein 2 were depleted of the protein by RNA interference. Transwell migration and scratch wounding assays showed markedly increased migration upon desmoglein 2 suppression whereas proliferation and viability remained unaltered. In gene expression profiles, desmoglein 2 depletion was associated with overexpression of migration-related genes. Strongest overexpression was found for secretogranin II which has not been reported in melanoma cells before. The bioactive peptide derived from secretogranin II, secretoneurin, is known to exert chemoattractive functions and was demonstrated here to stimulate melanoma cell migration. In summary, we show that desmoglein 2 expression attenuates migration of melanoma cells. The mechanism of desmoglein 2 impaired cell migration is mediated by downregulation of secretogranin II. Loss of desmoglein 2 increases expression of secretogranin II, followed by an enhanced migratory activity of melanoma cells. Our data add a new pathway of regulating melanoma cell migration related to a desmoglein 2-secretogranin II axis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (2), e89491-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>e89491</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Peitsch WK" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Doerflinger Y" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Fischer-Colbrie R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Huck V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Bauer AT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Utikal J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Goerdt S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Schneider SW" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24558503</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0089491</DOI><KST>G300</KST><KST>A991</KST><KEYWORD>MALIGNANT-MELANOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VITRO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUSCLE-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN MONOCYTES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OPENER JO-1 IMPROVES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEUROPEPTIDE SECRETONEURIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>E-cadherin</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DESMOSOMAL CADHERINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSENDOTHELIAL MIGRATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48917</publishedID><Artikel>Differential influence of vemurafenib and dabrafenib on patients' lymphocytes despite similar clinical efficacy in melanoma</Artikel><Journal>Annals of Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Since the majority of melanomas eventually become resistant and progress, combining selective BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) with immunotherapies has been proposed to achieve more durable treatment responses. Here, we explored the impact of selective BRAFi on the hosts' immune system. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical data, whole blood counts (WBC) and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) of 277 vemurafenib- and 65 dabrafenib-treated melanoma patients were evaluated. The frequency and phenotype of lymphocyte subpopulations were determined by flow cytometry while T cell cytokine secretion was measured by multiplex assays. RESULTS: Progression-free survival (PFS) as well as overall survival (OS) were similar in patients treated with either BRAFi. High pretreatment LDH was associated with shorter PFS and OS in both groups. During therapy, peripheral lymphocytes decreased by 24.3% (median, P &lt; 0.0001) in vemurafenib-treated patients but remained unchanged in dabrafenib-treated patients (+1.2%, P = 0.717). Differentiation of peripheral lymphocytes of vemurafenib-treated patients showed a significant decrease in CD4(+) T cells (P &lt; 0.05). Within CD4(+) T cells obtained during treatment, an increase in CCR7(+)CD45RA(+) (naive) and a decrease in CCR7(+)CD45RA(-) (central memory) populations were found (P &lt; 0.01 for both). Furthermore, secretion of interferon-gamma and interleukin-9 by CD4(+) T cells was significantly lower in samples obtained during vemurafenib treatment compared with baseline samples. CONCLUSION: While both compounds have comparable clinical efficacy, vemurafenib but not dabrafenib decreases patients peripheral lymphocyte counts and alters CD4(+) T cell phenotype and function. Thus, selective BRAFi can significantly affect patients' peripheral lymphocyte populations. Fully understanding these effects could be critical for successfully implementing combinatorial therapies of BRAFi with immunomodulatory agents.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>25 (3), 747-753</Feld596><PubVol>25</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>747</StrtPage><EndPage>753</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schilling B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Sondermann W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Zhao F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Griewank KG" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Livingstone E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Sucker A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Zelba H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Weide B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Trefzer U" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Wilhelm T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Loquai C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Berking C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Hassel J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Kahler KC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Utikal J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Al Ghazal P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Gutzmer R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Goldinger SM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="18" name="Zimmer L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="19" name="Paschen A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="20" name="Hillen U" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="21" name="Schadendorf D" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24504444</PMID><DOI>10.1093/annonc/mdt587</DOI><KST>G300</KST><KST>L201</KST><KST>L401</KST><KST>L501</KST><KST>L701</KST><KST>L801</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>BRAF</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INHIBITION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMMUNITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUBSETS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METASTATIC MELANOMA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48918</publishedID><Artikel>The retrobulbar sinus is superior to the lateral tail vein for the injection of contrast media in small animal cardiac imaging</Artikel><Journal>Laboratory Animals</Journal><ABSTr>Cardiac perfusion studies using computed tomography are a common tool in clinical practice. Recent technical advances and the availability of dedicated small animal scanners allow the transfer of these techniques to the preclinical sector in general and to mouse models of cardiac diseases in particular. This necessitates new requirements for contrast injection techniques as a rapid transport of contrast media from the intravenous access to the animal heart. Clinical contrast agents containing high iodine concentrations are used within small animal studies although they exhibit a high viscosity which might limit their transport within the vasculature. The authors provide a comparison of the transport of contrast media following an injection into the lateral tail vein and an injection into the retrobulbar sinus and discuss the anatomy involved. The temporal evolution of a contrast bolus and its in vivo distribution is visualized. It is demonstrated that injecting contrast agents into the lateral tail vein of mice results in a retrograde blood flow to the liver veins and therefore does not deliver a detectable contrast bolus to the heart, and thus it cannot be used for cardiac perfusion studies. By contrast, boli injected into the retrobulbar sinus are rapidly transported to the heart and provide ventricular contrast enabling perfusion studies similar to those in human patients. The results demonstrate that an injection into the retrobulbar sinus is superior to an injection into the lateral tail vein for the delivery of contrast boli to the animal heart, while all drawbacks of an injection into the lateral tail vein are overcome.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>48 (2), 105-113</Feld596><PubVol>48</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>105</StrtPage><EndPage>113</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Socher M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Kuntz J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Sawall S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Bartling S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kachelriess M" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24468712</PMID><DOI>10.1177/0023677213517500</DOI><KST>E010</KST><KST>E020</KST><KST>W410</KST><KST>E025</KST><KEYWORD>MODELS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PERFUSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEART-FAILURE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>micro-CT</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48919</publishedID><Artikel>CMV infection and glioma, a highly controversial concept struggling in the clinical arena</Artikel><Journal>Neuro-Oncology</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>16 (3), 332-3</Feld596><PubVol>16</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>332</StrtPage><EndPage>3</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Wick W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Platten M" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24523454</PMID><DOI>10.1093/neuonc/nou002</DOI><KST>G370</KST><KST>G160</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>HUMAN CYTOMEGALOVIRUS-INFECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VALGANCICLOVIR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLIOBLASTOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMORS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48920</publishedID><Artikel>Dietary intakes of individual flavanols and flavonols are inversely associated with incident type 2 diabetes in European populations</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Nutrition</Journal><ABSTr>Dietary flavanols and flavonols, flavonoid subclasses, have been recently associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Europe. Even within the same subclass, flavonoids may differ considerably in bioavailability and bioactivity. We aimed to examine the association between individual flavanol and flavonol intakes and risk of developing T2D across European countries. The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-InterAct case-cohort study was conducted in 8 European countries across 26 study centers with 340,234 participants contributing 3.99 million person-years of follow-up, among whom 12,403 incident T2D cases were ascertained and a center-stratified subcohort of 16,154 individuals was defined. We estimated flavonoid intake at baseline from validated dietary questionnaires using a database developed from Phenol-Explorer and USDA databases. We used country-specific Prentice-weighted Cox regression models and random-effects meta-analysis methods to estimate HRs. Among the flavanol subclass, we observed significant inverse trends between intakes of all individual flavan-3-ol monomers and risk of T2D in multivariable models (all P-trend &lt; 0.05). We also observed significant trends for the intakes of proanthocyanidin dimers (HR for the highest vs. the lowest quintile: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.92; P-trend = 0.003) and trimers (HR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.80, 1.04; P-trend = 0.07) but not for proanthocyanidins with a greater polymerization degree. Among the flavonol subclass, myricetin (HR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.93; P-trend = 0.001) was associated with a lower incidence of T2D. This large and heterogeneous European study showed inverse associations between all individual flavan-3-ol monomers, proanthocyanidins with a low polymerization degree, and the flavonol myricetin and incident T2D. These results suggest that individual flavonoids have different roles in the etiology of T2D.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>144 (3), 335-343</Feld596><PubVol>144</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>335</StrtPage><EndPage>343</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Zamora-Ros R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Forouhi NG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Sharp SJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Gonzalez CA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Buijsse B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Guevara M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="van der Schouw YT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Amiano P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Bredsdorff L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Fagherazzi G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Feskens EJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Franks PW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Grioni S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Katzke V" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Key TJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Kuehn T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="18" name="Masala G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Mattiello A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Molina-Montes E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Nilsson PM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Perquier F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Redondo ML" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Ricceri F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Rolandsson O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Romieu I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Roswall N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Scalbert A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Schulze M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Slimani N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Spijkerman AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Tormo MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Touillaud M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="van der A DL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="van Woudenbergh GJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Langenberg C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Wareham NJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24368432</PMID><DOI>10.3946/jn.113.184945</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COHORT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POLYPHENOLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WOMEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMANS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>nutrition</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TEA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPIC-INTERACT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Food sources</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48956</publishedID><Artikel>Indirect evidence for proton pump inhibitor failure in patients taking them independent of meals</Artikel><Journal>Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety</Journal><ABSTr>Purpose We investigated the association between conditions of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment failure and food intake in an elderly ambulatory population.
 
Methods Our data originate from a large population-based cohort study. During a home visit done by a trained study physician, patients were asked for each medication to state whether it was taken in relation to a meal (before, concurrently with, and after) or independent of a meal. This information was analyzed for all patients taking a PPI daily and correlated to markers of PPI failure.
 
Results Out of 2717 patients participating in a home visit and taking at least one medication, 383 took a PPI daily (14.1%). A PPI intake independent of meals was defined as incorrect and was observed in 64 patients, whereas 319 patients took their PPI in relation to a meal, which was defined as the correct intake. Treatment failure was observed in 10 out of 64 (15.6%) PPI users with incorrect intake and in 18 out of 319 (5.6%) PPI users with correct intake. The risk of treatment failure was threefold higher in patients taking their PPI independent of meals (OR 3.35; 95% CI 1.44-7.76).
 
Conclusion The higher risk for PPI failure in patients taking PPIs independent of meals suggests that synchronized PPI administration with meals is indeed essential, and better counseling of patients is needed.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (7), 768-772</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>768</StrtPage><EndPage>772</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Freigofas J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Haefeli WE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Schoettker B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Quinzler R" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24723311</PMID><DOI>10.1002/pds.3620</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>GASTROESOPHAGEAL-REFLUX DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHARMACOKINETICS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACID SUPPRESSION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48966</publishedID><Artikel>Strategies in the treatment of recurrent refractory multiple myeloma</Artikel><Journal>Onkologe</Journal><ABSTr>Multiple myeloma is a malignant lymphoproliferative B-cell disease of the bone marrow characterized by proliferation of monoclonal plasma cells.

A structured review of the treatment options for relapsed multiple myeloma is summarized using current publications.

Novel agents, such as thalidomide, bortezomib and lenalidomide have improved the outcome in patients with recurrent/relapsed myeloma and resulted in prolongation of overall survival. High-dose therapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) should be considered as a treatment option for patients in a good general condition and with a prolonged disease control (at least 12-24 months) after upfront ASCT.

Treatment strategies for myeloma patients depend on the general physical condition and response as well as side effects of previous therapies. Carfilzomib and pomalidomide should be considered as new treatment options for patients with recurrent/relapsed myeloma refractory to bortezomib and/or lenalidomide. Further drugs are currently being evaluated in several clinical trials. Allogeneic haematopoetic stem cell transplantation is still debateable and should only be considered as a treatment option within clinical trials.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>20 (3), 250-256</Feld596><PubVol>20</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>250</StrtPage><EndPage>256</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Goldschmidt,H."

However, to date no epidemiological study has investigated the influence of the MD on bladder cancer. We evaluated the association between adherence to the MD and risk of urothelial cell bladder cancer (UCC), according to tumor aggressiveness, in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). The analysis included 477,312 participants, recruited from ten European countries between 1991 and 2000. Information from validated dietary questionnaires was used to develop a relative Mediterranean diet score (rMED), including nine dietary components. Cox regression models were used to assess the effect of the rMED on UCC risk, while adjusting for dietary energy and tobacco smoking of any kind. Stratified analyses were performed by sex, BMI, smoking status, European region and age at diagnosis. During an average follow-up of 11 years, 1,425 participants (70.9% male) were diagnosed with a first primary UCC. There was a negative but non-significant association between a high versus low rMED score and risk of UCC overall (HR: 0.84 [95% CI 0.69, 1.03]) and risk of aggressive (HR: 0.88 [95% CI 0.61, 1.28]) and non-aggressive tumors (HR: 0.78 [95% CI 0.54, 1.14]). Although there was no effect modification in the stratified analyses, there was a significant 34% (p = 0.043) decreased risk of UCC in current smokers with a high rMED score. In EPIC, the MD was not significantly associated with risk of UCC, although we cannot exclude that a MD may reduce risk in current smokers.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>134 (10), 2504-2511</Feld596><PubVol>134</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>2504</StrtPage><EndPage>2511</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Buckland G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Ros MM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Roswall N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Travier N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Kiemeney LA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Sacerdote C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Ljungberg B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Gram IT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Skeie G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Malm J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Ehrnstrom R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Chang-Claude J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="16" name="Mattiello A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Agnoli C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Peeters PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Boutron-Ruault MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Fagherazzi G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Clavel-Chapelon F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Nilsson LM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Amiano P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Oikonomou E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Tsiotas K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Sanchez MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Quiros JR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Chirlaque MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Barricarte A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Key TJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Allen NE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Wareham N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Kaaks R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="38" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Palli D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Romieu I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Romaguera D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Gonzalez CA" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24226765</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28573</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>carotenoids</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VEGETABLE CONSUMPTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VITAMIN-C</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>UROTHELIAL CELL-CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEALTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>nutrition</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FRUIT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48969</publishedID><Artikel>Association of pre- and post-natal parental smoking with offspring body mass index: an 8-year follow-up of a birth cohort</Artikel><Journal>Pediatric Obesity</Journal><ABSTr>What is already known about this subject Maternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with offspring overweight, but it is still unclear whether this association is due to confounding by parental lifestyle habits or caused by direct effects of intrauterine tobacco smoke exposure. What this study adds Maternal smoking during pregnancy was validated by cord serum cotinine measurements and the offspring body mass index was assessed at various ages. Maternal smoking during pregnancy was significantly associated with offspring body mass index at 8 years of age with a trend for increased body mass index from 4 years of age onwards. Paternal smoking and smoking of both parents at pre- and post-natal periods was positively associated with offspring body mass index, which suggests residual confounding by lifestyle habits in smoking families rather than intrauterine effects. BACKGROUND: Although many epidemiological studies have shown an association between maternal smoking during pregnancy and offspring overweight, it is still under debate whether intrauterine tobacco smoke exposure directly affects offspring obesity or if the association is rather due to confounding by lifestyle factors. OBJECTIVES: The association of parental smoking habits at pre- and post-natal periods with offspring body mass index (BMI) was investigated, whereas maternal smoking during pregnancy was validated by cord serum cotinine measurements. METHODS: Multivariable linear regression analysis, based on the German Ulm Birth Cohort Study of 1045 children born in 2000 with annual/biennial follow-up until the age of 8 years (n = 609), was conducted. RESULTS: BMI of offspring from mothers who smoked during pregnancy and non-smoking mothers differed significantly at 8 years. Maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated with an increase in BMI of 0.73 kg m(-2) [95% confidence interval: 0.21-1.25] in 8-year-old children after adjustment for multiple potential confounding variables. Both pre- and post-natal smoking of fathers (0.34 [0.01-0.66]/0.45 [0.08-0.81]) and of both parents (1.03 [0.43-1.63]/0.56 [0.14-0.98]) were likewise significantly associated with offspring BMI. CONCLUSIONS: The observed patterns suggest that residual confounding by living conditions in smoking families rather than specific intrauterine exposure to tobacco smoke may account for the increased risk of offspring overweight.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (2), 121-134</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>121</StrtPage><EndPage>134</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Florath I" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Kohler M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Weck MN" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Brandt S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Rothenbacher D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Schoettker B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Moss A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Gottmann P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Wabitsch M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>23420701</PMID><DOI>10.1111/j.2047-6310.2012.00146</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>RISK-FACTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPOSURE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHILDREN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHILDHOOD OBESITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RAPID WEIGHT-GAIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INFANCY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PREGNANCY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OVERWEIGHT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>maternal smoking</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48971</publishedID><Artikel>Estimating colorectal cancer treatment costs: a pragmatic approach exemplified by health insurance data from Germany</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: The cost of colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment is a crucial parameter to inform cost-effectiveness analyses on CRC screening but it is not readily available and therefore often lacking. We aimed to elaborate and exemplify a pragmatic approach to estimate CRC treatment cost based on health insurance data from Germany. METHODS: We included two groups of persons who were continuously health-insured between 2005-2010: A) Cases: Persons with a hospital discharge diagnosis of CRC (ICD C18-C20) between 2007-2010 and no such a diagnosis between 2005-2006 (to focus on incident CRC cases); B) Controls: Persons without a diagnosis of CRC during the observation period, matched to CRC cases by age and sex (matching factor: 1ratio5). We considered in-patient, out-patient and drug costs and calculated incremental costs as the difference in means between cases and controls. We divided costs into three phases of care (initial, intermediate and end-of-life phase). RESULTS: The initial, the intermediate and the end-of-life phase included 12,792, 5,280, and 3,779 CRC cases, respectively, and 63,960, 26,400, and 18,895 controls. The mean incremental costs--annualized for each phase--were euro26,000, euro2,300, and euro51,700, respectively. The costs of the initial phase of care were higher for rectal than for colon cancer. Annualized stage-specific cost estimates ranged from euro15,000 to euro21,300 for early stages and from euro29,800 to euro35,000 for late stages. CONCLUSION: This pragmatic and feasible approach provided plausible estimates of CRC treatment costs in Germany; being transferable to other settings, it may thus facilitate to weigh up potential savings in treatment costs against the resources required for CRC control programs in various countries.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (2), e88407-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>e88407</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Haug U" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Engel S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Verheyen F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Linder R" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24586324</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0088407</DOI><KST>M110</KST><KEYWORD>colonoscopy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ILLNESS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CARE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COUNTRIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POPULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIAGNOSIS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48973</publishedID><Artikel>Intra- and Interdimeric Caspase-8 Self-Cleavage Controls Strength and Timing of CD95-Induced Apoptosis</Artikel><Journal>Science Signaling</Journal><ABSTr>Apoptosis in response to the ligand CD95L (also known as Fas ligand) is initiated by caspase-8, which is activated by dimerization and self-cleavage at death-inducing signaling complexes (DISCs). Previous work indicated that the degree of substrate cleavage by caspase-8 determines whether a cell dies or survives in response to a death stimulus. To determine how a death ligand stimulus is effectively translated into caspase-8 activity, we assessed this activity over time in single cells with compartmentalized probes that are cleaved by caspase-8 and used multiscale modeling to simultaneously describe single-cell and population data with an ensemble of single-cell models. We derived and experimentally validated a minimal model in which cleavage of caspase-8 in the enzymatic domain occurs in an interdimeric manner through interaction between DISCs, whereas prodomain cleavage sites are cleaved in an intradimeric manner within DISCs. Modeling indicated that sustained membrane-bound caspase-8 activity is followed by transient cytosolic activity, which can be interpreted as a molecular timer mechanism reflected by a limited lifetime of active caspase-8. The activation of caspase-8 by combined intra- and interdimeric cleavage ensures weak signaling at low concentrations of CD95L and strongly accelerated activation at higher ligand concentrations, thereby contributing to precise control of apoptosis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>7 (316), ra23-</Feld596><PubVol>7</PubVol><PubIss>316</PubIss><StrtPage>ra23</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Kallenberger SM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Beaudouin J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Claus J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Fischer C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Sorger PK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Legewie S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Eils R" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24619646</PMID><DOI>10.1126/scisignal.2004738</DOI><KST>B080</KST><KEYWORD>RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MECHANISM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL-DEATH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SIGNALING COMPLEX DISC</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXTRINSIC APOPTOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROCASPASE-8 ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>C-FLIPL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SINGLE CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CD95</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RESONANCE ENERGY-TRANSFER</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48974</publishedID><Artikel>Triptolide reverses hypoxia-induced EMT and stem-like features in pancreatic cancer by NF-kappaB downregulation</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is one of the most lethal malignancies characterized by an intense tumor stroma with hypoperfused regions, a significant inflammatory response and pronounced therapy resistance. New therapeutic agents are urgently needed. The plant-derived agent triptolide also known as "thunder god vine" has a long history in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and cancer and is now in phase II trials. We mimicked the situation in patient tumors by induction of hypoxia in experimental models of pancreatic cancer stem cells (CSCs) and evaluated the therapeutic effect of triptolide. Hypoxia led to induction of colony and spheroid formation, ALDH1 and NF-kappaB activity, migratory potential, and a switch in morphology to a fibroblastoid phenotype, as well as stem cell- and EMT-associated protein expression. Triptolide efficiently inhibited hypoxia-induced transcriptional signaling and downregulated EMT and CSC features in established highly malignant cell lines, whereas sensitive cancer cells or non-malignant cells were less affected. In vivo triptolide inhibited tumor take and tumor growth. In primary CSCs isolated from patient tumors triptolide downregulated markers of CSCs, proliferation and mesenchymal cells along with upregulation of markers for apoptosis and epithelial cells. This study is the first to show that triptolide reverses EMT and CSC characteristics and therefore may be superior to current chemotherapeutics for treatment of PDA.

We evaluated the HPV16 infection on survival of HNSCC Brazilian patient series. METHODS: This cohort comprised 1,093 HNSCC cases recruited from 1998 to 2008 in four Brazilian cities and followed up until June 2009. HPV16 antibodies were analyzed by multiplex Luminex assay. In a subset of 398 fresh frozen or paraffin blocks of HNSCC specimens, we analyzed for HPV16 DNA by L1 generic primer polymerase chain reaction. HNSCC survival according to HPV16 antibodies was evaluated through Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression. RESULTS: Prevalence of HPV16 E6 and E6/E7 antibodies was higher in oropharyngeal cancer than in other head and neck tumor sites. HPV16 DNA positive in tumor tissue was also higher in the oropharynx. Seropositivity for HPV16 E6 antibodies was correlated with improved HNSCC survival and oropharyngeal cancer. The presence of HPV16 E6/E7 antibodies was correlated with improved HNSCC survival and oropharyngeal cancer survival. The death risk of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma patients HPV16 E6/E7 antibodies positive was 78 % lower than to those who test negative. CONCLUSION: Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma is less aggressive in the HPV16 E6/E7 positive serology patients. HPV16 E6/E7 antibody is a clinically sensible surrogate prognostic marker of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>25 (4), 461-471</Feld596><PubVol>25</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>461</StrtPage><EndPage>471</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Lopez RV" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Levi JE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Eluf-Neto J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Koifman RJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Koifman S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Curado MP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Michaluart-Junior P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Figueiredo DL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Saggioro FP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="de Carvalho MB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Kowalski LP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Abrahao M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="de Gois-Filho F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Tajara EH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Waterboer T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Boffetta P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Brennan P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Wunsch-Filho V" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24474236</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s10552-014-0348-8</DOI><KST>F020</KST><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BIOMARKERS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IDENTIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SQUAMOUS-CELL CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POSITIVE HEAD</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>glutathione-S-transferase</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>serology</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>oropharyngeal cancer</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48976</publishedID><Artikel>Gut commensal bacteria and regional Wnt gene expression in the proximal versus distal colon</Artikel><Journal>American Journal of Pathology</Journal><ABSTr>Regional expression of Wingless/Int (Wnt) genes plays a central role in regulating intestinal development and homeostasis. However, our knowledge of such regional Wnt proteins in the colon remains limited. To understand further the effect of Wnt signaling components in controlling intestinal epithelial homeostasis, we investigated whether the physiological heterogeneity of the proximal and distal colon can be explained by differential Wnt signaling. With the use of a Wnt signaling-specific PCR array, expression of 84 Wnt-mediated signal transduction genes was analyzed, and a differential signature of Wnt-related genes in the proximal versus distal murine colon was identified. Several Wnt agonists (Wnt5a, Wnt8b, and Wnt11), the Wnt receptor frizzled family receptor 3, and the Wnt inhibitory factor 1 were differentially expressed along the colon length. These Wnt signatures were associated with differential epithelial cell proliferation and migration in the proximal versus distal colon. Furthermore, reduced Wnt/beta-catenin activity and decreased Wnt5a and Wnt11 expression were observed in mice lacking commensal bacteria, an effect that was reversed by conventionalization of germ-free mice. Interestingly, myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 knockout mice showed decreased Wnt5a levels, indicating a role for Toll-like receptor signaling in regulating Wnt5a expression. Our results suggest that the morphological and physiological heterogeneity within the colon is in part facilitated by the differential expression of Wnt signaling components and influenced by colonization with bacteria.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>184 (3), 592-599</Feld596><PubVol>184</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>592</StrtPage><EndPage>599</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Neumann PA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Koch S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Hilgarth RS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Perez-Chanona E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Denning P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Jobin C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Nusrat A" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24418259</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.ajpath.2013.11.029</DOI><KST>A050</KST><KEYWORD>HOMEOSTASIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PANETH CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NONCANONICAL WNT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MICROBIOTA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTESTINAL EPITHELIAL-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECEPTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>proliferation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISEASE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>48977</publishedID><Artikel>Assessment and prognostic significance of the epidermal growth factor receptor vIII mutation in glioblastoma patients treated with concurrent and adjuvant temozolomide radiochemotherapy</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>The epidermal growth factor receptor vIII mutant (EGFRvIII) is found in approximately 50% of all EGFR-amplified glioblastomas and constitutes a tumor-specific therapeutic target. To assess molecular testing approaches and the prognostic role of EGFRvIII in patients treated according to current standards of care, we compared different EGFRvIII detection methods and correlated EGFRvIII status with outcome in a prospective patient cohort of the German Glioma Network. In total, 184 newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients were investigated for EGFR amplification and for expression of EGFR and EGFRvIII by immunohistochemistry. Further, the EGFRvIII status was additionally studied by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated EGFRvIII in 34 of 184 patients (18%). RT-PCR or MLPA analysis detected 4 additional EGFRvIII-positive patients. Overall, RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were more sensitive for EGFRvIII detection than MLPA. EGFRvIII status was not associated with progression-free and overall survival. EGFRvIII also had no prognostic significance in the subgroup of patients who were free from progression after concomitant radiochemotherapy and thus would be eligible for the ongoing ACT IV EGFRvIII vaccination trial. Age, extent of resection, and O6 -methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation status appeared to be less prognostic in EGFRvIII-positive patients. Thus, EGFRvIII positivity is not a major negative prognostic factor in glioblastoma patients treated according to current standards of care. Data from phase II EGFRvIII-targeted vaccination trials compare favorably with the present contemporary results, supporting the further exploration of EGVRvIII vaccination in newly diagnosed glioblastoma.

Although targeting of TNF in models of MS has been successful, the pathological role of TNF in MS remains unclear due to clinical trials where the non-selective inhibition of TNF resulted in exacerbated disease. Subsequent experiments have indicated that this may have resulted from the divergent effects of the two TNF receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2. Here we show that the selective targeting of TNFR1 with an antagonistic antibody ameliorates symptoms of the most common animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), when given following both a prophylactic and therapeutic treatment regime. Our results demonstrate that antagonistic TNFR1-specific antibodies may represent a therapeutic approach for the treatment of MS in the future.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (2), e90117-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>e90117</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Williams SK" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Maier O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Fischer R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Fairless R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Hochmeister S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Stojic A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Pick L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Haar D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Musiol S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Storch MK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Pfizenmaier K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Diem R" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24587232</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0090117</DOI><KST>G370</KST><KEYWORD>FACTOR-ALPHA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FACTOR RECEPTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPERIMENTAL AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DEMYELINATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPERIMENTAL ALLERGIC ENCEPHALOMYELITIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>KAPPA-B</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR-NECROSIS-FACTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MICE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49011</publishedID><Artikel>Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and cognitive decline: A longitudinal study among non-demented older adults</Artikel><Journal>Dementia and Geriatric Cognitive Disorders</Journal><ABSTr>Background/Aims: Very few studies have investigated the longitudinal association between serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH) D] and cognitive impairment not due to dementia. This longitudinal study analysed 25(OH) D and the risk of cognitive decline among non-demented older adults. Methods: A subsample of the ESTHER cohort study, aged &gt;= 70 years, was assessed with the Cognitive Telephone Screening Instrument (COGTEL) and underwent 25(OH) D measurements standardized with a reference method (n = 1,302). After an average follow-up of 4.6 years, 527 participants had repeated COGTEL testing and were eligible for analysis. Linear regression models were used to assess longitudinal associations between 25(OH) D levels and cognitive function. Possible practice effects of repeated cognitive testing were addressed with the reliable change index. Results: A trend of a more pronounced cognitive decline with lower vitamin D levels was observed among both women and men, with a statistically significant difference in COGTEL scores in the lowest vitamin D quintile of the total sample. Conclusions: This study indicates that low levels of vitamin D might be associated with cognitive decline among non-demented elderly individuals and highlights the need for further large-scale prospective studies to clarify the potential role of vitamin D in cognitive function at an old age.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>38 (3-4), 254-263</Feld596><PubVol>38</PubVol><PubIss>3-4</PubIss><StrtPage>254</StrtPage><EndPage>263</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Perna L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Mons U" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kliegel M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24969663</PMID><DOI>10.1159/000362870</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DEMENTIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PERFORMANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DYSFUNCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ELDERLY POPULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VITAMIN-D DEFICIENCY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PERSPECTIVE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMPAIRMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METAANALYSIS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49022</publishedID><Artikel>Unbiased RNAi screen for hepcidin regulators links hepcidin suppression to proliferative Ras/RAF and nutrient-dependent mTOR signaling</Artikel><Journal>Blood</Journal><ABSTr>The hepatic hormone hepcidin is a key regulator of systemic iron metabolism. Its expression is largely regulated by 2 signaling pathways: the "iron-regulated" bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and the inflammatory JAK-STAT pathways. To obtain broader insights into cellular processes that modulate hepcidin transcription and to provide a resource to identify novel genetic modifiers of systemic iron homeostasis, we designed an RNA interference (RNAi) screen that monitors hepcidin promoter activity after the knockdown of 19 599 genes in hepatocarcinoma cells. Interestingly, many of the putative hepcidin activators play roles in signal transduction, inflammation, or transcription, and affect hepcidin transcription through BMP-responsive elements. Furthermore, our work sheds light on new components of the transcriptional machinery that maintain steady-state levels of hepcidin expression and its responses to the BMP- and interleukin-6-triggered signals. Notably, we discover hepcidin suppression mediated via components of Ras/RAF MAPK and mTOR signaling, linking hepcidin transcriptional control to the pathways that respond to mitogen stimulation and nutrient status. Thus using a combination of RNAi screening, reverse phase protein arrays, and small molecules testing, we identify links between the control of systemic iron homeostasis and critical liver processes such as regeneration, response to injury, carcinogenesis, and nutrient metabolism.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>123 (10), 1574-1585</Feld596><PubVol>123</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>1574</StrtPage><EndPage>1585</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Mleczko-Sanecka,K."

Although beta-catenin dependent and independent Wnt signaling pathways have been shown to control angiogenesis, the contribution of individual cell types to activate these downstream pathways in endothelial cells (ECs) during blood vessel formation is still elusive. To investigate the role of ECs in contributing Wnt ligands for regulation of blood vessel formation, we conditionally deleted the Wnt secretion factor Evi in mouse ECs (Evi-ECKO). Evi-ECKO mice showed decreased microvessel density during physiological and pathological angiogenesis in the postnatal retina and in tumors, respectively. The reduced microvessel density resulted from increased vessel regression accompanied by decreased EC survival and proliferation. Concomitantly, survival-related genes were downregulated and cell cycle arrest- and apoptosis-inducing genes were upregulated. EVI silencing in cultured HUVECs showed similar target gene regulation, supporting a mechanism of EC-derived Wnt ligands in controlling EC function. ECs preferentially expressed non-canonical Wnt ligands and canonical target gene expression was unaffected in Evi-ECKO mice. Furthermore, the reduced vascularization of Matrigel plugs in Evi-ECKO mice could be rescued by introduction of non-canonical Wnt5a. Treatment of mouse pups with the non-canonical Wnt inhibitor TNP470 resulted in increased vessel regression accompanied by decreased EC proliferation, thus mimicking the proliferation-dependent Evi-ECKO remodeling phenotype. Taken together, this study identified EC-derived non-canonical Wnt ligands as regulators of EC survival, proliferation and subsequent vascular pruning during developmental and pathological angiogenesis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>141 (8), 1757-1766</Feld596><PubVol>141</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>1757</StrtPage><EndPage>1766</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Korn,C."

Previous studies demonstrated that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detects structural and functional abnormalities in lungs from older patients with CF without radiation exposure.

Objectives: To evaluate the potential of MRI to detect abnormal lung structure and perfusion in infants and preschool children with CF, and to monitor the response to therapy for pulmonary exacerbation.

Methods: MRI studies were performed in 50 children with CF (age, 3.1 +/- 2.1 yr; range, 0-6 yr) in stable clinical condition (n = 40) or pulmonary exacerbation before and after antibiotic treatment (n = 10), and in 26 non-CF control subjects (age, 2.9 +/- 1.9 yr). T1-and T2-weighted sequences before and after intravenous contrast and first-pass perfusion imaging were acquired, and assessed on the basis of a dedicated morphofunctional score.

Measurements and Main Results: MRI demonstrated bronchial wall thickening/bronchiectasis, mucus plugging, and perfusion deficits from the first year of life in most stable patients with CF (global score, 10.0 +/- 4.0), but not in non-CF control subjects (score, 0.0 +/- 0.0; P, 0.001). In patients with exacerbations, the global MRI score was increased to 18.0 +/- 2.0 (P, 0.001), and was significantly reduced to 12.0 +/- 3.0 (P, 0.05) after antibiotic therapy.

Conclusions: MRI detected abnormalities in lung structure and perfusion, and response to therapy for exacerbations in infants and preschool children with CF. These results support the development of MRI for noninvasive monitoring and as an end point in interventional trials for early CF lung disease.

EC50 is the concentration of the compound that gives half-maximal response. Dose-response data are typically evaluated by using a log-logistic model that includes EC50 as one of the model parameters. Often, more than one experiment is carried out to determine the EC50 value for a compound, requiring summarization of EC50 estimates from a series of experiments. In this context, mixed-effects models are designed to estimate the average behavior of EC50 values over all experiments by considering the variabilities within and among experiments simultaneously. However, fitting nonlinear mixed-effects models is more complicated than in a linear situation, and convergence problems are often encountered. An alternative strategy is the application of a meta-analysis approach, which combines EC50 estimates obtained from separate log-logistic model fitting. These two proposed strategies to summarize EC50 estimates from multiple experiments are compared in a simulation study and real data example. We conclude that the meta-analysis strategy is a simple and robust method to summarize EC50 estimates from multiple experiments, especially suited in the case of a small number of experiments.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>56 (3), 493-512</Feld596><PubVol>56</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>493</StrtPage><EndPage>512</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Jiang,X."

STAT5 can be phosphorylated at three positions, on a tyrosine and on the two serines S725 and S779. We have investigated the importance of STAT5 serine phosphorylation for BCR-ABL-induced leukemogenesis. In cultured bone marrow cells, expression of a STAT5 mutant lacking the S725 and S779 phosphorylation sites (STAT5(SASA)) prohibits transformation and induces apoptosis. Accordingly, STAT5(SASA) BCR-ABL(+) cells display a strongly reduced leukemic potential in vivo, predominantly caused by loss of S779 phosphorylation that prevents the nuclear translocation of STAT5. Three distinct lines of evidence indicate that S779 is phosphorylated by group I p21-activated kinase (PAK). We show further that PAK-dependent serine phosphorylation of STAT5 is unaffected by BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment. Interfering with STAT5 phosphorylation could thus be a novel therapeutic approach to target BCR-ABL-induced malignancies.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>28 (3), 629-641</Feld596><PubVol>28</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>629</StrtPage><EndPage>641</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Berger A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Hoelbl-Kovacic A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bourgeais J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Hoefling L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Warsch W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Grundschober E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Uras IZ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Menzl I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Putz EM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Hoermann G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Schuster C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Fajmann S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Leitner E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Kubicek S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Moriggl R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Gouilleux F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Sexl V" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24263804</PMID><DOI>10.1038/leu.2013.351</DOI><KST>T010</KST><KEYWORD>DNA-BINDING ACTIVITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MAMMARY-GLAND</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INDUCED NUCLEAR IMPORT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INDUCED TRANSFORMATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POLYCYTHEMIA-VERA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONSTITUTIVE ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHRONIC MYELOID-LEUKEMIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL-LINES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49081</publishedID><Artikel>Factors associated with oxidative stress and cancer risk in the Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium</Artikel><Journal>Free Radical Research</Journal><ABSTr>Both endogenous factors (genomic variations) and exogenous factors (environmental exposures, lifestyle) impact the balance of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Variants of the ND3 (rs2853826; G10398A) gene of the mitochondrial genome, manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD; rs4880 Val16Ala) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX-1; rs1050450 Pro198Leu), are purported to have functional effects on regulation of ROS balance. In this study, we examined associations of breast and prostate cancer risks and survival with these variants, and interactions between rs4880-rs1050450, and alcohol consumption-rs2853826. Nested case-control studies were conducted in the Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3), consisting of nine cohorts. The analyses included over 10726 post-menopausal breast and 7532 prostate cancer cases with matched controls. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate associations with risk, and proportional hazard models were used for survival outcomes. We did not observe significant interactions between polymorphisms in MnSOD and GPX-1, or between mitochondrial polymorphisms and alcohol intake and risk of either breast (p-interaction of 0.34 and 0.98, respectively) or prostate cancer (p-interaction of 0.49 and 0.50, respectively). We observed a weak inverse association between prostate cancer risk and GPX-1 Leu198Leu carriers (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79-0.97, p = 0.01). Overall survival among women with breast cancer was inversely associated with G10398 carriers who consumed alcohol (HR 0.66 95% CI 0.49-0.88). Given the high power in our study, it is unlikely that interactions tested have more than moderate effects on breast or prostate cancer risk. Observed associations need both further epidemiological and biological confirmation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>48 (3), 380-386</Feld596><PubVol>48</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>380</StrtPage><EndPage>386</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Blein S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Berndt S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Joshi AD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Campa D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Ziegler RG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Cox DG" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24437375</PMID><DOI>10.3109/10715762.2013.875168</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>DNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>polymorphism</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VARIANTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUSCEPTIBILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALCOHOL-CONSUMPTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SMOKERS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REPAIR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GPX ACTIVITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MNSOD</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49082</publishedID><Artikel>High throughput synthetic lethality screen reveals a tumorigenic role of adenylate cyclase in fumarate hydratase-deficient cancer cells</Artikel><Journal>BMC Genomics</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Synthetic lethality is an appealing technique for selectively targeting cancer cells which have acquired molecular changes that distinguish them from normal cells. High-throughput RNAi-based screens have been successfully used to identify synthetic lethal pathways with well-characterized tumor suppressors and oncogenes. The recent identification of metabolic tumor suppressors suggests that the concept of synthetic lethality can be applied to selectively target cancer metabolism as well. RESULTS: Here, we perform a high-throughput RNAi screen to identify synthetic lethal genes with fumarate hydratase (FH), a metabolic tumor suppressor whose loss-of-function has been associated with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC). Our unbiased screen identified synthetic lethality between FH and several genes in heme metabolism, in accordance with recent findings. Furthermore, we identified an enrichment of synthetic lethality with adenylate cyclases. The effects were validated in an embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293T) and in HLRCC-patient derived cells (UOK262) via both genetic and pharmacological inhibition. The reliance on adenylate cyclases in FH-deficient cells is consistent with increased cyclic-AMP levels, which may act to regulate cellular energy metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: The identified synthetic lethality of FH with adenylate cyclases suggests a new potential target for treating HLRCC patients.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>15 (), Art.

In our hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy (GT) trial using a gamma-retroviral vector, 9 of 10 patients showed sustained engraftment and correction of WAS protein (WASP) expression in lymphoid and myeloid cells and platelets. GT resulted in partial or complete resolution of immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, and bleeding diathesis. Analysis of retroviral insertion sites revealed &gt;140,000 unambiguous integration sites and a polyclonal pattern of hematopoiesis in all patients early after GT. Seven patients developed acute leukemia [one acute myeloid leukemia (AML), four T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), and two primary T-ALL with secondary AML associated with a dominant clone with vector integration at the LMO2 (six T-ALL), MDS1 (two AML), or MN1 (one AML) locus]. Cytogenetic analysis revealed additional genetic alterations such as chromosomal translocations. This study shows that hematopoietic stem cell GT for WAS is feasible and effective, but the use of gamma-retroviral vectors is associated with a substantial risk of leukemogenesis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>6 (227), 227ra33-</Feld596><PubVol>6</PubVol><PubIss>227</PubIss><StrtPage>227ra33</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Braun CJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Boztug K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Paruzynski A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Witzel M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schwarzer A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Rothe M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Modlich U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Beier R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Gohring G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Steinemann D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Fronza R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Ball CR" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Haemmerle R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Naundorf S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Kuhlcke K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Rose M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Fraser C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Mathias L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Ferrari R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Abboud MR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Al-Herz W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Kondratenko I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Marodi L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Glimm H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="24" name="Schlegelberger B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Schambach A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Albert MH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Schmidt M*" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="28" name="von Kalle C*" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="29" name="Klein C*(*Co senior author)" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24622513</PMID><DOI>10.1126/scitranslmed.3007280</DOI><KST>G100</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>T-CELL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>insertional mutagenesis</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL REPERTOIRE DIVERSITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WASP</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SCID-X1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VECTOR INTEGRATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHRONIC GRANULOMATOUS-DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SEVERE COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49085</publishedID><Artikel>Objective comparison of particle tracking methods</Artikel><Journal>Nature Methods</Journal><ABSTr>Particle tracking is of key importance for quantitative analysis of intracellular dynamic processes from time-lapse microscopy image data.

Although no single method performed best across all scenarios, the results revealed clear differences between the various approaches, leading to notable practical conclusions for users and developers.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>11 (3), 281-289</Feld596><PubVol>11</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>281</StrtPage><EndPage>289</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Chenouard N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Smal I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="de Chaumont F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Maska M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Sbalzarini IF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Gong Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Cardinale J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Carthel C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Coraluppi S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Winter M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Cohen AR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Godinez WJ" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Rohr K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Kalaidzidis Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Liang L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Duncan J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Shen H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Xu Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Magnusson KE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Jalden J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Blau HM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Paul-Gilloteaux P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Roudot P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Kervrann C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Waharte F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Tinevez JY" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Shorte SL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Willemse J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Celler K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="van Wezel GP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Dan HW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Tsai YS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Ortiz de Solorzano C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Olivo-Marin JC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Meijering E" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24441936</PMID><DOI>10.1038/nmeth.2808</DOI><KST>B080</KST><KEYWORD>FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>video microscopy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AUTOMATED TRACKING</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DYNAMIC PROPERTIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSPORT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIVING CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ATOMIC-FORCE MICROSCOPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALGORITHMS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMAGES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>segmentation</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49086</publishedID><Artikel>Colorectal cancer stage at diagnosis in migrants versus non-migrants (KoMigra): study protocol of a cross-sectional study in Germany</Artikel><Journal>BMC Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: In Germany, about 20% of the total population have a migration background. Differences exist between migrants and non-migrants in terms of health care access and utilisation. Colorectal cancer is the second most common malignant tumour in Germany, and incidence, staging and survival chances depend, amongst other things, on ethnicity and lifestyle. The current study investigates whether stage at diagnosis differs between migrants and non-migrants with colorectal cancer in an area of high migration and attempts to identify factors that can explain any differences. METHODS/DESIGN: Data on tumour and migration status will be collected for 1,200 consecutive patients that have received a new, histologically verified diagnosis of colorectal cancer in a high migration area in Germany in the previous three months. The recruitment process is expected to take 16 months and will include gastroenterological private practices and certified centres for intestinal diseases. Descriptive and analytical analysis will be performed: the distribution of variables for migrants versus non-migrants and participants versus non-participants will be analysed using appropriate chi2-, t-, F- or Wilcoxon tests. Multivariable, logistic regression models will be performed, with the dependent variable being the dichotomized stage of the tumour (UICC stage I versus more advanced than UICC stage I). Odds ratios and associated 95%-confidence intervals will be calculated. Furthermore, ordered logistic regression models will be estimated, with the exact stage of the tumour at diagnosis as the dependent variable. Predictors used in the ordered logistic regression will be patient characteristics that are specific to migrants as well as patient characteristics that are not. Interaction models will be estimated in order to investigate whether the effects of patient characteristics on stage of tumour at the time of the initial diagnosis is different in migrants, compared to non-migrants. DISCUSSION: An association of migration status or other socioeconomic variables with stage at diagnosis of colorectal cancer would be an important finding with respect to equal health care access among migrants. It would point to access barriers or different symptom appraisal and, in the long term, could contribute to the development of new health care concepts for migrants.

METHODS: A population-based cohort of 238724 first-degree relatives of 46091 melanoma patients diagnosed in 1955-2010 in Nordic countries was followed for cancer incidence. FINDINGS: The CRM (0-79years) in first-degree relatives of a patient with superficial spreading (SSM), nodular (NM), or lentigo maligna melanoma was quite similar, ranging from 2.5% to about 3%, which represents about 2-fold increase over the general population risk. When one melanoma patient in the family was diagnosed before age 30, the CRM was about 3%. When there were 2 melanoma patients diagnosed before age 30 in a family, CRM for relatives was about 14%, 6% for diagnoses at age 30-59, and 5% for diagnoses at age 60 or older. Depending on age at diagnosis of same-sex twins (not known whether monozygotic/dizygotic), their CRM was about 7-21%. Although no familial case of concordant histological types of acral lentiginous/desmoplastic/compound nevus/spindle cell melanomas or malignant blue nevus was found, familial risks of discordant histological types of melanoma were interchangeably high for most of the types, e.g. higher risk of SSM when a first-degree relative had NM [standardized incidence ratios (SIR)=2.6, 95% confidence interval (CI)=2.1-3.3, n=72] or acral lentiginous (4.0, 95%CI=1.5-8.8, n=6) and vice versa. There was a tendency toward concordant age at diagnosis of melanoma among relatives of melanoma patients. INTERPRETATION: Findings of this study may help clinicians to find subjects at high melanoma risk for the genetic counseling. The risk was highest when melanoma occurred in a same-sex twin, one first-degree relative diagnosed at young age (&lt;30), or 2 first-degree relatives. Histological type of melanoma does not seem to play an important role in familial melanoma.

The syntheses and characterization of their ligands are also reported. It was found that control of the stereochemical preference between (S*,S*) and (S*,R*) diastereomers by substituent modification of the ligand sidearms was possible in the solid state with the preferred atomic coordinations of the sidearms consistent with expectations based on the electron-withdrawing properties of the substituent -o-CF3 group. The dilemma arising in terms of assigning the absolute configuration descriptors resulting from selecting between strictly following only the covalent bonds of the ligand and disregarding the nature of the bonds altogether and thus bringing the coordinate bonds into consideration to determine the stereochemical priority sequence is hereby resolved by declaring that the latter option is to be preferred. The results obtained here provide a clear indication that sidearm substitution of the Ni(II) and Pd(II) complexes need not disturb macromolecular stereochemical arrangements leading to quasidiastereomeric relationships. This permits the design of molecular systems sensitive to external stimuli with predictable macromolecular structure.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>43 (14), 5375-5381</Feld596><PubVol>43</PubVol><PubIss>14</PubIss><StrtPage>5375</StrtPage><EndPage>5381</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Han J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Ono T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Uekusa H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Klika KD" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Soloshonok VA" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24519315</PMID><DOI>10.1039/c3dt53312c</DOI><KST>G404</KST><KEYWORD>NUCLEOPHILIC GLYCINE EQUIVALENTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACRIDINYL THIOSEMICARBAZIDES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUPRAMOLECULAR ARRAYS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HELICAL CHIRALITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEW-GENERATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTERCONVERSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALPHA-AMINO-ACIDS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SPECIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DESIGN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOLECULES</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49094</publishedID><Artikel>Netrin-1 expression is an independent prognostic factor for poor patient survival in brain metastases</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>The multifunctional molecule netrin-1 is upregulated in various malignancies and has recently been presented as a major general player in tumorigenesis leading to tumor progression and maintenance in various animal models. However, there is still a lack of clinico-epidemiological data related to netrin-1 expression. Therefore, the aim of our study was to elucidate the association of netrin-1 expression and patient survival in brain metastases since those constitute one of the most limiting factors for patient prognosis. We investigated 104 brain metastases cases for netrin-1 expression using in-situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry with regard to clinical parameters such as patient survival and MRI data. Our data show that netrin-1 is strongly upregulated in most cancer subtypes. Univariate analyses revealed netrin-1 expression as a significant factor associated with poor patient survival in the total cohort of brain metastasis patients and in sub-entities such as non-small cell lung carcinomas. Interestingly, many cancer samples showed a strong nuclear netrin-1 signal which was recently linked to a truncated netrin-1 variant that enhances tumor growth. Nuclear netrin-1 expression was associated with poor patient survival in univariate as well as in multivariate analyses. Our data indicate both total and nuclear netrin-1 expression as prognostic factors in brain metastases patients in contrast to other prognostic markers in oncology such as patient age, number of brain metastases or Ki67 proliferation index. Therefore, nuclear netrin-1 expression constitutes one of the first reported molecular biomarkers for patient survival in brain metastases. Furthermore, netrin-1 may constitute a promising target for future anti-cancer treatment approaches in brain metastases.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (3), e92311-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>e92311</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Harter PN" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Zinke J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Scholz A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Tichy J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Zachskorn C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Kvasnicka HM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Goeppert B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Delloye-Bourgeois C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Hattingen E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Senft C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Steinbach JP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Plate KH" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Mehlen P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Schulte D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Mittelbronn M" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24647424</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0092311</DOI><KST>L501</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>CELL LUNG-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>carcinoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANGIOGENESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>APOPTOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OVEREXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DCC</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>UNC5C</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NUCLEAR</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49095</publishedID><Artikel>Aversive tension of adolescents with anorexia nervosa in daily course: a case-controlled and smartphone-based ambulatory monitoring trial</Artikel><Journal>BMJ open</Journal><ABSTr>Introduction Monitoring and reduction of aversive tension is a core issue in dialectical behaviour therapy of patients. It has been shown that aversive tension is increased in adult borderline personality disorder and is linked to low emotion labelling ability. However, until now there is no documented evidence that patients with anorexia nervosa suffer from aversive tension as well. Furthermore the usability of a smartphone application for ambulatory monitoring purposes has not been sufficiently explored.

Methods and analysis We compare the mean and maximum self-reported aversive tension in 20 female adolescents (12-19years) with anorexia nervosa in outpatient treatment with 20 healthy controls. They are required to answer hourly, over a 2-day period, that is, about 30 times, four short questions on their smartphone, which ensures prompt documentation without any recall bias. At the close out, the participants give a structured usability feedback on the application and the procedure.

Ethics and dissemination The achieved result of this trial has direct relevance for efficient therapy strategies and is a prerequisite for trials regarding dialectical behaviour therapy in anorexia nervosa. The results will be disseminated through peer-review publications. The ethics committee of the regional medical association in Mainz, Germany approved the study protocol under the reference number 837.177.13.

Trial Registration number The trial is registered at the German clinical trials registration under the reference number DRKS00005228.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>4 (4), e004703-</Feld596><PubVol>4</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>e004703</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Kolar DR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Buerger A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Hammerle F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Jenetzky E" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24760350</PMID><DOI>10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004703</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>outpatients</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BORDERLINE PERSONALITY-DISORDER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MODEL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FOLLOW-UP</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIALECTICAL BEHAVIOR-THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EATING-DISORDERS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BULIMIA-NERVOSA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FEMALE-PATIENTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DYSREGULATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49098</publishedID><Artikel>Gain of chromosome 1q21 is an independent adverse prognostic factor in light chain amyloidosis patients treated with melphalan/dexamethasone</Artikel><Journal>Amyloid - Journal of Protein Folding Disorders</Journal><ABSTr>Chromosomal aberrations of plasma cells are well established pathogenetic and prognostic factors in multiple myeloma, but their prognostic implication in systemic light chain (AL) amyloidosis is unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify prognostic cytogenetic risk factors by interphase FISH in a series of 103 consecutive AL amyloidosis patients treated uniformly with melphalan/dexamethasone as first-line therapy. Detection of gain of 1q21 was predictive for a poor overall survival (OS) (median 12.5 versus 38.2 months, p=0.002). Hematologic event free survival (hem EFS) for gain of 1q21 was 5.0 versus 8.5 months in median (p=0.08) and haematologic remission rates (&gt;= VGPR) after three cycles were 5% versus 25% (p=0.06). Most important, in multivariate concordance analyses the adverse prognosis carried by gain of 1q21 was retained as an independent prognostic factor (OS: p=0.003, average hazard ratio (AHR) 3.64, hemEFS: p=0.008, AHR=2.35), along with the well established Mayo cardiac staging. Patients with t(11; 14) had a longer median OS with 38.2 months versus 17.5 months, though no statistical significance was reached. Deletion 13q14 and hyperdiploidy turned out to be prognostically neutral. In conclusion, we have identified gain of 1q21 as an independent adverse prognostic factor in AL amyloidosis patients treated with standard chemotherapy.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>21 (1), 9-17</Feld596><PubVol>21</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>9</StrtPage><EndPage>17</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Bochtler,T."

Systemic dissemination is most likely caused by circulating tumor cells (CTC). Despite the fundamental role of CTC within the metastatic cascade, technical obstacles have so far prevented detailed genomic and, in particular, phenotypic analyses of CTC, which may provide molecular targets to delay or prevent distant metastases. We show here a detailed genomic analysis of single colorectal cancer-derived CTC by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), mutational profiling, and microsatellite instability (MSI) analysis. Furthermore, we report the first gene expression analysis of manually selected colorectal cancer-derived CTC by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to investigate transcriptional changes, enabling CTC to survive in circulation and form distant metastases. aCGH confirmed the tumor cell identity of CellSearch-isolated colorectal cancer-derived CTC. Mutational and MSI analyses revealed mutational profiles of CTC to be similar, but not identical to the corresponding tumor tissue. Several CTC exhibited mutations in key genes such as KRAS or TP53 that could not be detected in the tumor. Gene expression analyses revealed both a pronounced upregulation of CD47 as a potential immune-escape mechanism and a significant downregulation of several other pathways, suggesting a dormant state of viable CTC. Our results suggest mutational heterogeneity between tumor tissue and CTC that should be considered in future trials on targeted therapy and monitoring of response. The finding of upregulated immune-escape pathways, which may be responsible for survival of CTC in circulation, could provide a promising target to disrupt the metastatic cascade in colorectal cancer.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>74 (8), 1694-1704</Feld596><PubVol>74</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>1694</StrtPage><EndPage>1704</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Steinert,G."

The mutations are more frequent at both intermittently and chronically sun-exposed sites than non-exposed sites and tend to co-occur with BRAF and CDKN2A alterations. The association with parameters generally connected with poor outcome, coupled with high recurrence and mechanistic relevance, raises the possibility of the eventual use of TERT promoter mutations in the disease management.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>5 (), Art.

It was the aim of this study to comprehensively analyze clinical and functional properties of various FLT3 mutants. In 672 normal karyotype AML patients FLT3-ITD, but not FLT3-TKD mutations were associated with a worse relapse free and overall survival in multivariate analysis. In paired diagnosis-relapse samples FLT3-ITD showed higher stability (70%) compared to FLT3-TKD (30%). In vitro, FLT3-ITD induced a strong activating phenotype in Ba/F3 cells. In contrast, FLT3-TKD mutations and other point mutations--including two novel mutations--showed a weaker but clear gain-of-function phenotype with gradual increase in proliferation and protection from apoptosis. The pro-proliferative capacity of the investigated FLT3 mutants was associated with cell surface expression and tyrosine 591 phosphorylation of the FLT3 receptor. Western blot experiments revealed STAT5 activation only in FLT3-ITD positive cell lines, in contrast to FLT3-non-ITD mutants, which displayed an enhanced signal of AKT and MAPK activation. Gene expression analysis revealed distinct difference between FLT3-ITD and FLT3-TKD for STAT5 target gene expression as well as deregulation of SOCS2, ENPP2, PRUNE2 and ART3. FLT3-ITD and FLT3 point mutations show a gain-of-function phenotype with distinct signalling properties in vitro. Although poor prognosis in AML is only associated with FLT3-ITD, all activating FLT3 mutations can contribute to leukemogenesis and are thus potential targets for therapeutic interventions.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (3), e89560-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>e89560</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Janke H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Pastore F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Schumacher D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Herold T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Hopfner KP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Schneider S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Berdel WE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Buchner T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Woermann BJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Subklewe M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Bohlander SK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Hiddemann W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Spiekermann K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Polzer H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24608088</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0089560</DOI><KST>L701</KST><KEYWORD>JUXTAMEMBRANE DOMAIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HIGH-DOSE CYTARABINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>normal karyotype</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POINT MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TYROSINE KINASE DOMAIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTERNAL TANDEM DUPLICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROLONGED MAINTENANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INDUCE TRANSFORMATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STAT5 ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONSTITUTIVE ACTIVATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49103</publishedID><Artikel>Genome Sequencing of SHH Medulloblastoma Predicts Genotype-Related Response to Smoothened Inhibition</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Cell</Journal><ABSTr>Smoothened (SMO) inhibitors recently entered clinical trials for sonic-hedgehog-driven medulloblastoma (SHH-MB). Clinical response is highly variable. To understand the mechanism(s) of primary resistance and identify pathways cooperating with aberrant SHH signaling, we sequenced and profiled a large cohort of SHH-MBs (n = 133). SHH pathway mutations involved PTCH1 (across all age groups), SUFU (infants, including germline), and SMO (adults). Children &gt;3 years old harbored an excess of downstream MYCN and GLI2 amplifications and frequent TP53 mutations, often in the germline, all of which were rare in infants and adults. Functional assays in different SHH-MB xenograft models demonstrated that SHH-MBs harboring a PTCH1 mutation were responsive to SMO inhibition, whereas tumors harboring an SUFU mutation or MYCN amplification were primarily resistant.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>25 (3), 393-405</Feld596><PubVol>25</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>393</StrtPage><EndPage>405</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kool M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Jones DT" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Jaeger N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Northcott PA" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Pugh TJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hovestadt V" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Piro RM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Esparza LA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Markant SL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Remke M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Milde T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Bourdeaut F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Ryzhova M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Sturm D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="14" name="Pfaff E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Stark S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="16" name="Hutter S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="17" name="Seker-Cin H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="18" name="Johann P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="19" name="Bender S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="20" name="Schmidt C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="21" name="Rausch T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Shih D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Reimand J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Sieber L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="25" name="Wittmann A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="26" name="Linke L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="27" name="Witt H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="28" name="Weber UD" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="29" name="Zapatka M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="30" name="Koenig R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="31" name="Beroukhim R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Bergthold G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="van Sluis P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Volckmann R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Koster J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Versteeg R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Schmidt S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="38" name="Wolf S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="39" name="Lawerenz C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="40" name="Bartholomae CC" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="41" name="von Kalle C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="42" name="Unterberg A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Herold-Mende C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="44" name="Hofer S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="45" name="Kulozik AE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="46" name="von Deimling A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="47" name="Scheurlen W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="48" name="Felsberg J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="49" name="Reifenberger G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="50" name="Hasselblatt M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="51" name="Crawford JR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="52" name="Grant GA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="53" name="Jabado N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="54" name="Perry A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="55" name="Cowdrey C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="56" name="Croul S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="57" name="Zadeh G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="58" name="Korbel JO" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="59" name="Doz F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="60" name="Delattre O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="61" name="Bader GD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="62" name="McCabe MG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="63" name="Collins VP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="64" name="Kieran MW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="65" name="Cho YJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="66" name="Pomeroy SL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="67" name="Witt O" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="68" name="Brors B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="69" name="Taylor MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="70" name="Schueller U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="71" name="Korshunov A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="72" name="Eils R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="73" name="Wechsler-Reya RJ*" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="74" name="Lichter P*" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="75" name="Pfister SM* (* shared senior authorship)" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24651015</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.ccr.2014.02.004</DOI><KST>B080</KST><KST>B060</KST><KST>G100</KST><KST>G340</KST><KST>G380</KST><KST>B062</KST><KST>W190</KST><KEYWORD>NERVOUS-SYSTEM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ITRACONAZOLE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TERT PROMOTER MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEDGEHOG PATHWAY INHIBITOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PEDIATRIC MEDULLOBLASTOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADULT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOUSE MODELS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49104</publishedID><Artikel>Phosphorylation of multifunctional galectins by protein kinases CK1, CK2, and PKA</Artikel><Journal>Analytical Biochemistry</Journal><ABSTr>Phosphorylation is known to have a strong impact on protein functions. We analyzed members of the lectin family of multifunctional galectins as targets of the protein kinases CK1, CK2, and PKA. Galectins are potent growth regulators able to bind both glycan and peptide motifs at intra- and extracellular sites. Performing in vitro kinase assays, galectin phosphorylation was detected by phosphoprotein staining and autoradiography. The insertion of phosphoryl groups varied to a large extent depending on the type of kinase applied and the respective galectin substrate. Sites of phosphorylation observed in the recombinant galectins were determined by a strategic combination of phosphopeptide enrichment and nano-ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (nanoUPLC-MS/MS). By in silico modeling, phosphorylation sites were visualized three-dimensionally. Our results reveal galectin-type-specific Ser-/Thr-dependent phosphorylation beyond the known example of galectin-3. These data are the basis for functional studies and also illustrate the analytical sensitivity of the applied methods for further work on human lectins.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>449 (), 109-17</Feld596><PubVol>449</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>109</StrtPage><EndPage>17</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kuebler D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Seidler J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Andre S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kumar S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schwartz-Albiez R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Lehmann WD" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Gabius HJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24333252</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.ab.2013.12.006</DOI><KST>A060</KST><KST>W160</KST><KST>D015</KST><KEYWORD>GLYCOPROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUGAR CODE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MEMBRANE L1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BINDING</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PERFORMANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SPECTROSCOPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LECTIN</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49105</publishedID><Artikel>ID2 and ID3 protein expression mirrors granulopoietic maturation and discriminates between acute leukemia subtypes</Artikel><Journal>Histochemistry and Cell Biology</Journal><ABSTr>The inhibitors of DNA binding (ID) inhibit basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors and thereby guide cellular differentiation and proliferation. To elucidate the involvement of IDs in hematopoiesis and acute leukemias (AL), we analyzed ID2 and ID3 expression in hematopoiesis and leukemic blasts in bone marrow biopsies (BMB). BMB of healthy stem cell donors (n = 19) and BMB of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MD; n = 19), de novo AML (n = 20), B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) (n = 23), T-ALL (n = 19), were immunohistochemically stained for ID2 and ID3 expression. The expression patterns were evaluated and quantified for each hematopoietic lineage and each leukemia subtype. In normal BMB, immature granulopoiesis showed weak ID2 and strong ID3 expression, which was lost during maturation (p &lt; 0.001). Erythropoiesis remained negative for ID2/3 (p &lt; 0.001). ID2/3 expression differed between immature granulopoiesis and leukemic blasts (p &lt; 0.001). Moreover, differential ID2/3 expression was seen between AL subgroups: AML, especially AML-MD, had more ID2- (p &lt; 0.001) and ID3-positive (p &lt; 0.001) blasts than ALL. We show a comprehensive in situ picture of ID2/3 expression in hematopoiesis and AL. Morphologically, ID2/3 proteins seem to be involved in the granulopoietic maturation. Importantly, the distinct ID2/3 expression patterns in AL indicate a specific deregulation of ID2/3 in the various types of AL and may support subtyping of AL.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>141 (4), 431-440</Feld596><PubVol>141</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>431</StrtPage><EndPage>440</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="May AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Frey AV" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bogatyreva L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Benkisser-Petersen M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Hauschke D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Luebbert M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Wasch R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Werner M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Hasskarl J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Lassmann S" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24292846</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00418-013-1169-7</DOI><KST>L601</KST><KEYWORD>BREAST-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA-BINDING</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MESSENGER-RNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIFFERENTIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MYELOID DEVELOPMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>E2A GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LOOP-HELIX PROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEMATOPOIETIC PROGENITORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL-CYCLE ARREST</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49106</publishedID><Artikel>BRAF-V600 mutations have no prognostic impact in stage IV melanoma patients treated with monochemotherapy</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: The impact of BRAF tumor mutations on the natural course of disease of melanoma patients is controversial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the mutational status and overall survival of 215 patients receiving treatment with dacarbazine or temozolomide. All patients who started first-line treatment at our institution between 2000 and 2010 were included to prevent selection and bias due to thereafter arising therapeutic options. RESULTS: No patient received BRAF- or MEK-inhibitors during follow-up. Survival was associated with the pattern of visceral involvement, the presence of brain metastases and the serum lactate dehydrogenase level (all p&lt;0.001). The BRAF-V600 mutational status was not associated with survival and no differences in overall survival were detected according to age, gender or to the cytotoxic agent used for therapy. In Cox regression analysis the presence of brain metastases (hazard ratio 2.3; p&lt;0.001) and an elevated serum LDH (hazard ratio 2.5; p&lt;0.001) were the only factors, which independently predicted survival.

In neurons, connexin36 (Cx36) is the most abundant isoform; however, the mechanisms underlying formation of Cx36-containing electrical synapses are unknown. We focus on homocellular and heterocellular gap junctions formed by an AII amacrine cell, a key interneuron found in all mammalian retinas. In mice lacking native Cx36 but expressing a variant tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein at the C-terminus (KO-Cx36-EGFP), heterocellular gap junctions formed between AII cells and ON cone bipolar cells are fully functional, whereas homocellular gap junctions between two AII cells are not formed. A tracer injected into an AII amacrine cell spreads into ON cone bipolar cells but is excluded from other AII cells. Reconstruction of Cx36-EGFP clusters on an AII cell in the KO-Cx36-EGFP genotype confirmed that the number, but not average size, of the clusters is reduced - as expected for AII cells lacking a subset of electrical synapses. Our studies indicate that some neurons exhibit at least two discriminatory mechanisms for assembling Cx36. We suggest that employing different gap-junction-forming mechanisms could provide the means for a cell to regulate its gap junctions in a target-cell-specific manner, even if these junctions contain the same connexin.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>127 (Pt 6), 1190-1202</Feld596><PubVol>127</PubVol><PubIss>Pt 6</PubIss><StrtPage>1190</StrtPage><EndPage>1202</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Meyer A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Hilgen G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Dorgau B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Sammler EM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Weiler R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Monyer H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Dedek K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Hormuzdi SG" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24463820</PMID><DOI>10.1242/jcs.133066</DOI><KST>A230</KST><KEYWORD>ELECTRICAL SYNAPSES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONE BIPOLAR CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ZONULA OCCLUDENS-1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MAMMALIAN RETINA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OSCILLATORY POTENTIALS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VISUAL TRANSMISSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PLEXIFORM LAYER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RODENT RETINA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RABBIT RETINA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOUSE RETINA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49108</publishedID><Artikel>Validation of anthropometric indices of adiposity against whole-body magnetic resonance imaging--a study within the German European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohorts</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: In epidemiological studies, measures of body fat generally are obtained through anthropometric indices such as the body mass index (BMI), waist (WC), and hip circumferences (HC). Such indices, however, can only provide estimates of a person's true body fat content, overall or by adipose compartment, and may have limited accuracy, especially for the visceral adipose compartment (VAT). OBJECTIVE: To determine the extent to which different body adipose tissue compartments are adequately predicted by anthropometry, and to identify anthropometric measures alone, or in combination to predict overall adiposity and specific adipose tissue compartments, independently of age and body size (height). METHODS: In a sub-study of 1,192 participants of the German EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) cohorts, whole-body MRI was performed to determine adipose and muscle tissue compartments. Additional anthropometric measurements of BMI, WC and HC were taken. RESULTS: After adjusting for age and height, BMI, WC and HC were better predictors of total body volume (TBV), total adipose tissue (TAT) and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) than for VAT, coronary adipose tissue (CAT) and skeletal muscle tissue (SMT). In both sexes, BMI was the best predictor for TBV (men: r = 0.72 [0.68-0.76], women: r = 0.80 [0.77-0.83]) and SMT (men: r = 0.52 [0.45-0.57], women: r = 0.48 [0.41-0.54]). WC was the best predictor variable for TAT (r = 0.48 [0.41-0.54]), VAT (r = 0.44 [0.37-0.50]) and CAT (r = 0.34 [0.26-0.41]) (men), and for VAT (r = 0.42 [0.35-0.49]) and CAT (r = 0.29 [0.22-0.37]) (women). BMI was the best predictor for TAT (r = 0.49 [0.43-0.55]) (women). HC was the best predictor for SAT (men (r = 0.39 [0.32-0.45]) and women (r = 0.52 [0.46-0.58])). CONCLUSIONS: Especially the volumes of internal body fat compartments are poorly predicted by anthropometry. A possible implication may be that associations of chronic disease risks with the sizes of internal body fat as measured by BMI, WC and HC may be strongly underestimated.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (3), e91586-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>e91586</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Neamat-Allah J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Wald D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Huesing A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Teucher B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Wendt A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Delorme S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Dinkel J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Vigl M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Bergmann MM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Feller S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Hierholzer J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Kaaks R" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24626110</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0091586</DOI><KST>E010</KST><KST>C020</KST><KST>E130</KST><KEYWORD>VISCERAL FAT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CARDIOVASCULAR RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ABDOMINAL OBESITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TISSUE DISTRIBUTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>metabolic syndrome</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MASS INDEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>QUANTIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MRI</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>mechanisms</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49109</publishedID><Artikel>Nogo-A-deficient Transgenic Rats Show Deficits in Higher Cognitive Functions, Decreased Anxiety, and Altered Circadian Activity Patterns

In Nogo-A knockout and knockdown laboratory rodents, behavioral alterations were observed, possibly corresponding with human neuropsychiatric diseases of neurodevelopmental origin, particularly schizophrenia. This study offers further insight into behavioral manifestations of Nogo-A knockdown in laboratory rats, focusing on spatial and non-spatial cognition, anxiety levels, circadian rhythmicity, and activity patterns. Demonstrated is an impairment of cognitive functions and behavioral flexibility in a spatial active avoidance task, while non-spatial memory in a step-through avoidance task was spared. No signs of anhedonia, typical for schizophrenic patients, were observed in the animals. Some measures indicated lower anxiety levels in the Nogo-A-deficient group. Circadian rhythmicity in locomotor activity was preserved in the Nogo-A knockout rats and their circadian period (tau) did not differ from controls. However, daily activity patterns were slightly altered in the knockdown animals. We conclude that a reduction of Nogo-A levels induces changes in CNS development, manifested as subtle alterations in cognitive functions, emotionality, and activity patterns.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>8 (), Art.

We examined the risk of secondary postischemic hemorrhage after thrombolysis in rodents pretreated with rivaroxaban or warfarin. Mice were pretreated with either rivaroxaban (30 mg/kg), warfarin (target international normalized ratio 2 to 3) or vehicle. After 2 or 3 hours, middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), mice received 9 mg/kg recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. Twenty-four hours after MCAO, secondary hemorrhage was quantified using a macroscopic hemorrhage score and hemoglobin spectrophotometry. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability was measured by Evans Blue spectrofluorometry. To increase the validity of our findings, experiments were also performed using a thromboembolic model in anticoagulated rats. Infarct size did not differ among groups. Pretreatment with warfarin led to significantly more secondary hemorrhage compared with rivaroxaban and nonanticoagulated controls after 2- and 3-hour ischemia in mice as well as in rats. Blood-brain barrier permeability was significantly higher in the warfarin group compared with rivaroxaban and control. Thus, rivaroxaban in contrast to warfarin does not increase secondary hemorrhage after thrombolysis in experimental cerebral ischemia. Less effects of rivaroxaban on postischemic BBB permeability may account for this difference.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>34 (3), 495-501</Feld596><PubVol>34</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>495</StrtPage><EndPage>501</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ploen R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Sun L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Zhou W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Heitmeier S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Zorn M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Jenetzky E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Veltkamp R" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24346690</PMID><DOI>10.1038/jcbfm.2013.226</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>TISSUE-PLASMINOGEN ACTIVATOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SECONDARY INTRACEREBRAL HEMORRHAGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NONVALVULAR ATRIAL-FIBRILLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CEREBRAL-ARTERY OCCLUSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FACTOR-XA INHIBITOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEMOSTATIC THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>oral anticoagulants</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>QUANTITATIVE-EVALUATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DABIGATRAN</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49111</publishedID><Artikel>The binary protein-protein interaction landscape of Escherichia coli</Artikel><Journal>Nature Biotechnology</Journal><ABSTr>Efforts to map the Escherichia coli interactome have identified several hundred macromolecular complexes, but direct binary protein-protein interactions (PPIs) have not been surveyed on a large scale. Here we performed yeast two-hybrid screens of 3,305 baits against 3,606 preys ( approximately 70% of the E. coli proteome) in duplicate to generate a map of 2,234 interactions, which approximately doubles the number of known binary PPIs in E. coli. Integration of binary PPI and genetic-interaction data revealed functional dependencies among components involved in cellular processes, including envelope integrity, flagellum assembly and protein quality control. Many of the binary interactions that we could map in multiprotein complexes were informative regarding internal topology of complexes and indicated that interactions in complexes are substantially more conserved than those interactions connecting different complexes.

MPNST often pose a diagnostic challenge due to their frequent lack of pathognomonic morphological or immunohistochemical features. Mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene are found in all NF1-associated and many sporadic MPNST. The presence of NF1 mutation may have the potential to differentiate MPNST from several morphologically similar neoplasms; however, mutation detection is hampered by the size of the gene and the lack of mutational hot spots. Here we describe a newly developed monoclonal antibody binding to the C-terminus of neurofibromin (clone NFC) which was selected for optimal performance in routinely processed formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue. NFC immunohistochemistry revealed loss of neurofibromin in 22/25 (88 %) of NF1-associated and 26/61 (43 %) of sporadic MPNST. There was a strong association of neurofibromin loss with deletions affecting the NF1 gene (P &lt; 0.01). In a series of 256 soft tissue tumors of different histotypes NFC staining showed loss of neurofibromin in 2/8 myxofibrosarcomas, 2/12 (16 %) pleomorphic liposarcomas, 1/16 (6 %) leiomyosarcomas, and 4/28 (14 %) unclassified undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas. However, loss of neurofibromin was not observed in 22 synovial sarcomas, 27 schwannomas, 23 solitary fibrous tumors, 14 low-grade fibromyxoid sarcomas, 50 dedifferentiated liposarcomas, 27 myxoid liposarcomas, 13 angiosarcomas, 9 extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas, and 7 epitheloid sarcomas. Immunohistochemistry using antibody NFC may substantially facilitate sarcoma research and diagnostics.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>127 (4), 565-72</Feld596><PubVol>127</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>565</StrtPage><EndPage>72</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Reuss DE" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Habel A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Hagenlocher C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Mucha J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Ackermann U" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Tessmer C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Meyer J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Capper D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Moldenhauer G" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Mautner V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Frappart PO" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Schittenhelm J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Hartmann C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Hagel C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Katenkamp K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Petersen I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Mechtersheimer G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="von Deimling A" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24464231</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00401-014-1246-6</DOI><KST>G380</KST><KST>G390</KST><KST>L801</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>TYPE-1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DELETION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GERMLINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>soft-tissue sarcoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SPECTRUM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUPPRESSOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MEK INHIBITION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NF1</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49113</publishedID><Artikel>Glutathione S-transferase L1 multiplex serology as a measure of cumulative infection with human papillomavirus</Artikel><Journal>BMC Infectious Diseases</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Several assays are used to measure type-specific serological responses to human papillomavirus (HPV), including the bead-based glutathione S-transferase (GST)-L1 multiplex serology assay and virus-like particle (VLP)-based ELISA. We evaluated the high-throughput GST-L1, which is increasingly used in epidemiologic research, as a measure of cumulative HPV infection and future immune protection among HPV-unvaccinated women. METHODS: We tested enrollment sera from participants in the control arm of the Costa Rica Vaccine Trial (n = 488) for HPV16 and HPV18 using GST-L1, VLP-ELISA, and two assays that measure neutralizing antibodies (cLIA and SEAP-NA). With statistical adjustment for sampling, we compared GST-L1 serostatus to established HPV seropositivity correlates and incident cervical HPV infection using odds ratios. We further compared GST-L1 to VLP-ELISA using pair-wise agreement statistics and by defining alternate assay cutoffs. RESULTS: Odds of HPV16 GST-L1 seropositivity increased with enrollment age (OR = 1.20 per year, 95%CI 1.03-1.40) and lifetime number of sexual partners (OR = 2.06 per partner, 95%CI 1.49-2.83), with similar results for HPV18. GST-L1 seropositivity did not indicate protection from incident infection over 4 years of follow-up (HPV16 adjusted OR = 1.72, 95%CI 0.95-3.13; HPV18 adjusted OR = 0.38, 95%CI 0.12-1.23). Seroprevalence by GST-L1 (HPV16 and HPV18, respectively) was 5.0% and 5.2%, compared to 19.4% and 23.8% by VLP-ELISA, giving positive agreement of 39.2% and 20.8%. Lowering GST-L1 seropositivity cutoffs improved GST-L1/VLP-ELISA positive agreement to 68.6% (HPV16) and 61.5% (HPV18). CONCLUSIONS: Our data support GST-L1 as a marker of cumulative HPV infection, but not immune protection. At lower seropositivity cutoffs, GST-L1 better approximates VLP-ELISA.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>14 (), Art. Nr.: 120-</Feld596><PubVol>14</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>Art.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was carried out for consecutive patients who underwent 1.5 Tesla eMRI for local staging before open radical prostatectomy. The cohort was dichotomized into patients with apparent or inapparent tumour on eMRI. The results were compared with final histopathology, and an analysis for presence of clinically significance PCa was performed. RESULTS: A total of 385 patients were included in the study; in 85 patients (22 %), no apparent lesion suspicious for PCa was detected on eMRI, still final pathology revealed clinically significant PCa in 61 of these patients (72 %). In contrast, 256 (85 %) of the 300 patients with apparent tumour in eMRI harboured clinically significant PCa. eMRI could not differentiate clinically significant from insignificant PCa in neither of the groups (p &gt; 0.6). CONCLUSIONS: Presence of clinically significant cancer cannot be excluded by high-resolution 1.5 Tesla T2-weighted eMRI. The results of the study suggest that the role of T2-weighted eMRI for selecting patients suitable for AS is limited.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>32 (2), 379-383</Feld596><PubVol>32</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>379</StrtPage><EndPage>383</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Roethke MC" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Kniess M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kaufmann S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Lichy MP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schlemmer HP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Stenzl A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Schilling D" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>23754478</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00345-013-1106-3</DOI><KST>E010</KST><KEYWORD>SPECTROSCOPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PREDICTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COIL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DEFINITION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LOCAL STAGING ACCURACY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49115</publishedID><Artikel>Effects of bone marrow or mesenchymal stem cell transplantation on oral mucositis (mouse) induced by fractionated irradiation</Artikel><Journal>Strahlentherapie und Onkologie</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Oral mucositis is a severe and dose limiting early side effect of radiotherapy for head-and-neck tumors. This study was initiated to determine the effect of bone marrow- and mesenchymal stem cell transplantation on oral mucositis (mouse tongue model) induced by fractionated irradiation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Daily fractionated irradiation (5 x 3 Gy/week) was given over 1 (days 0-4) or 3 weeks (days 0-4, 7-11, 14-18). Each protocol was terminated (day 7 or 21) by graded test doses (5 dose groups, 10 animals each) in order to generate complete dose-effect curves. The incidence of mucosal ulceration, corresponding to confluent mucositis grade 3 (RTOG/EORTC), was analyzed as the primary, clinically relevant endpoint. Bone marrow or mesenchymal stem cells were transplanted intravenously at various time points within these fractionation protocols. RESULTS: Transplantation of 6 x 10(6), but not of 3 x 10(6) bone marrow stem cells on day - 1, + 4, + 8, + 11 or + 15 significantly increased the ED50 values (dose, at which an ulcer is expected in 50 % of the mice); transplantation on day + 2, in contrast, was ineffective. Mesenchymal stem cell transplantation on day - 1, 2 or + 8 significantly, and on day + 4 marginally increased the ED50 values. CONCLUSION: Transplantation of bone marrow or mesenchymal stem cells has the potential to modulate radiation-induced oral mucositis during fractionated radiotherapy. The effect is dependent on the timing of the transplantation. The mechanisms require further investigation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>190 (4), 399-404</Feld596><PubVol>190</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>399</StrtPage><EndPage>404</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schmidt M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Haagen J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Noack R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Siegemund A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Gabriel P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Doerr W" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24452815</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00066-013-0510-3</DOI><KST>L301</KST><KEYWORD>NORMAL-TISSUES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>regenerative medicine</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PLASTICITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REPOPULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TREATMENT TIME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NECK-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMPENSATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEAD</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MODULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>radiotherapy</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49116</publishedID><Artikel>Thalidomide Regulation of NF-kappaB Proteins Limits Tregs Activity in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</Artikel><Journal>Advances in Clinical and Experimental Medicine</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Thalidomide may represent a novel therapeutic strategy in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Since the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) causes not only malignant transformation and tumor progression, but also allows tumor cells to evade immune surveillance, NF-kappaB signaling components might constitute a potential target for future therapy in CLL. OBJECTIVES: The current study is an attempt to characterize proteins regulated by thalidomide. Thalidomide's influence on NF-kappaB proteins and on regulatory T cells (Treg) in CLL was investigated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 15 patients with CLL were treated with a combined thalidomide/fludarabine regimen. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. To evaluate glucocorticoidinduced tumour-necrosis-factor-receptor-related protein (GITR) expression in regulatory T cells, cells incubated with anti-CD3, ani-CD4 and anti-CD25 were permeabilized and then stained with anti-FOXP3 and analyzed using flow cytometry. Human TNF enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) levels in the serum. To evaluate NF-kappaB activity, chemiluminescent oligonucleotide-based ELISA was performed. RESULTS: It was found that thalidomide regulates NF-kappaB activity differentially, and the activity of certain NF-kappaB components correlated with TNF levels and T regulatory cell (CD4 + CD25 high GITR + ). CONCLUSIONS: These results might indicate that thalidomide not only regulates TNF but also directly interferes with NF-kappaB components.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (1), 25-32</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>25</StrtPage><EndPage>32</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Skorka K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Bhattacharya N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Wlasiuk P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kowal M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Mertens D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Dmoszynska A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Giannopoulos K" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24596000</PMID><KST>B061</KST><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>APOPTOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>T-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALPHA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INHIBITORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INDUCED TNF RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CYTOKINE MODULATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49117</publishedID><Artikel>Hip imaging of avascular necrosis at 7 Tesla compared with 3 Tesla</Artikel><Journal>Skeletal Radiology</Journal><ABSTr>Objectives To compare ultra-high field, high-resolution bilateral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the hips at 7 Tesla (T) with 3 T MRI in patients with avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head by subjective image evaluations, contrast measurements, and evaluation of the appearance of imaging abnormalities.

Thirteen subjects with avascular necrosis treated using advanced core decompression underwent MRI at both 7 T and 3 T. Sequence parameters as well as resolution were kept identical for both field strengths. All MR images (MEDIC, DESS, PD/T2w TSE, T1w TSE, and STIR) were evaluated by two radiologists with regard to subjective image quality, soft tissue contrasts, B1 homogeneity (four-point scale, higher values indicating better image quality) and depiction of imaging abnormalities of the femoral heads (three-point scale, higher values indicating the superiority of 7 T). Contrast ratios of soft tissues were calculated and compared with subjective data.

7-T imaging of the femoral joints, as well as 3-T imaging, achieved "good" to "very good" quality in all sequences. 7 T showed significantly higher soft tissue contrasts for T2w and MEDIC compared with 3 T (cartilage/fluid: 2.9 vs 2.2 and 3.6 vs 2.6), better detailed resolution for cartilage defects (PDw, T2w, T1w, MEDIC, DESS &gt; 2.5) and better visibility of joint effusions (MEDIC 2.6; PDw/T2w 2.4; DESS 2.2). Image homogeneity compared with 3 T (3.9-4.0 for all sequences) was degraded, especially in TSE sequences at 7 T through signal variations (7 T: 2.1-2.9); to a lesser extent also GRE sequences (7 T: 2.9-3.5). Imaging findings related to untreated or treated AVN were better delineated at 3 T (a parts per thousand currency sign1.8), while joint effusions (2.2-2.6) and cartilage defects (2.5-3.0) were better visualized at 7 T. STIR performed much more poorly at 7 T, generating large contrast variations (1.5).

7-T hip MRI showed comparable results in hip joint imaging compared with 3 T with slight advantages in contrast detail (cartilage defects) and fluid detection at 7 T when accepting image degradation medially.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>43 (5), 623-632</Feld596><PubVol>43</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>623</StrtPage><EndPage>632</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Theysohn,J.M."

Mutations fully abrogating gene function are unambiguously disease causing. However, missense mutations often have unknown functional implications, hampering genetic counselling. We have applied a novel approach to study three MSH2 unclassified variants (UVs) found in Dutch families with suspected Lynch syndrome. METHODS: The three mutations were recreated in the endogenous Msh2 gene in mouse embryonic stem cells by oligonucleotide-directed gene modification. The effect of the UVs on MMR activity was then tested using a set of functional assays interrogating the main MMR functions. RESULTS: We recreated and functionally tested three MSH2 UVs: MSH2-Y165D (c.493T&gt;G), MSH2-Q690E (c.2068C&gt;G) and MSH2-M813V (c.2437A&gt;G). We observed reduced levels of MSH2-Y165D and MSH2-Q690E but not MSH2-M813V proteins. MSH2-M813V was able to support all MMR functions similar to wild-type MSH2, whereas MSH2-Y165D and MSH2-Q690E showed partial defects. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results from our functional assays, we conclude that the MSH2-M813V variant is not disease causing. The MSH2-Y165D and MSH2-Q690E variants affect MMR function and are therefore likely the underlying cause of familial cancer predisposition. Since the MMR defect is partial, these variants may represent low penetrance alleles.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>51 (4), 245-253</Feld596><PubVol>51</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>245</StrtPage><EndPage>253</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Wielders EA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Hettinger J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Dekker R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kets CM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Ligtenberg MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Mensenkamp AR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="van den Ouweland AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Prins J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Wagner A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Dinjens WN" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Dubbink HJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="van Hest LP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Menko F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Hogervorst F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Verhoef S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="te Riele H" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24501230</PMID><DOI>10.1136/jmedgenet-2013-101987</DOI><KST>D100</KST><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CLASSIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NONPOLYPOSIS COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>microsatellite instability</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLON-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PREDISPOSITION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FAMILIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTS-ALPHA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MISSENSE SUBSTITUTIONS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49119</publishedID><Artikel>A soluble form of the giant cadherin Fat1 is released from pancreatic cancer cells by ADAM10 mediated ectodomain shedding</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>In pancreatic cancer, there is a clear unmet need to identify new serum markers for either early diagnosis, therapeutic stratification or patient monitoring. Proteomic analysis of tumor cell secretomes is a promising approach to indicate proteins released from tumor cells in vitro. Ectodomain shedding of transmembrane proteins has previously been shown to contribute significant fractions the tumor cell secretomes and to generate valuable serum biomarkers. Here we introduce a soluble form of the giant cadherin Fat1 as a novel biomarker candidate. Fat1 expression and proteolytic processing was analyzed by mass spectrometry and Western blotting using pancreatic cancer cell lines as compared to human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells. RNA expression in cancer tissues was assessed by in silico analysis of publically available microarray data. Involvement of ADAM10 (A Disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10) in Fat1 ectodomain shedding was analyzed by chemical inhibition and knockdown experiments. A sandwich ELISA was developed to determine levels of soluble Fat1 in serum samples. In the present report we describe the release of high levels of the ectodomain of Fat1 cadherin into the secretomes of human pancreatic cancer cells in vitro, a process that is mediated by ADAM10. We confirm the full-length and processed heterodimeric form of Fat1 expressed on the plasma membrane and also show the p60 C-terminal transmembrane remnant fragment corresponding to the shed ectodomain. Fat1 and its sheddase ADAM10 are overexpressed in pancreatic adenocarcinomas and ectodomain shedding is also recapitulated in vivo leading to increased Fat1 serum levels in some pancreatic cancer patients. We suggest that soluble Fat1 may find an application as a marker for patient monitoring complementing carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9). In addition, detailed analysis of the diverse processed protein isoforms of the candidate tumor suppressor Fat1 can also contribute to our understanding of cell biology and tumor behavior.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (3), e90461-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>e90461</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Wojtalewicz N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Sadeqzadeh E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Weiss JV" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Tehrani MM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Klein-Scory S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hahn S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Schmiegel W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Warnken U" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Schnoelzer M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="de Bock CE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Thorne RF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Schwarte-Waldhoff I" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24625754</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0090461</DOI><KST>B100</KST><KEYWORD>PROTOCADHERIN FAT1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SERUM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SIGNALING PATHWAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Drosophila</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADHESION MOLECULE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>beta-catenin</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BIOMARKERS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49120</publishedID><Artikel>On the origins of chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) contrast in tumors at 9.4 T</Artikel><Journal>NMR in Biomedicine</Journal><ABSTr>Chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) provides an indirect means to detect exchangeable protons within tissues through their effects on the water signal. Previous studies have suggested that amide proton transfer (APT) imaging, a specific form of CEST, detects endogenous amide protons with a resonance frequency offset 3.5 ppm downfield from water, and thus may be sensitive to variations in mobile proteins/peptides in tumors. However, as CEST measurements are influenced by various confounding effects, such as spillover saturation, magnetization transfer (MT) and MT asymmetry, the mechanism or degree of increased APT signal in tumors is not certain. In addition to APT, nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) effects upfield from water may also provide distinct information on tissue composition. In the current study, APT, NOE and several other MR parameters were measured and compared comprehensively in order to elucidate the origins of APT and NOE contrasts in tumors at 9.4 T. In addition to conventional CEST methods, a new intrinsic inverse metric was applied to correct for relaxation and other effects. After corrections for spillover, MT and T1 effects, corrected APT in tumors was found not to be significantly different from that in normal tissues, but corrected NOE effects in tumors showed significant decreases compared with those in normal tissues. Biochemical measurements verified that there was no significant enhancement of protein contents in the tumors studied, consistent with the corrected APT measurements and previous literature, whereas quantitative MT data showed decreases in the fractions of immobile macromolecules in tumors. Our results may assist in the better understanding of the contrast depicted by CEST imaging in tumors, and in the development of improved APT and NOE measurements for cancer imaging.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>27 (4), 406-416</Feld596><PubVol>27</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>406</StrtPage><EndPage>416</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Xu J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Zaiss M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Zu Z" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Li H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Xie J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Gochberg DF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Bachert P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Gore JC" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24474497</PMID><DOI>10.1002/nbm.3075</DOI><KST>E020</KST><KEYWORD>MRI</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SPECTROSCOPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RELAXATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RAT-BRAIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BRAIN-TUMORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLIOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NUCLEAR MAGNETIC-RESONANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WATER SATURATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NOE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49123</publishedID><Artikel>Mathematical modelling of adult hippocampal neurogenesis: effects of altered stem cell dynamics on cell counts and bromodeoxyuridine-labelled cells</Artikel><Journal>Journal of the Royal Society Interface</Journal><ABSTr>In the adult hippocampus, neurogenesis-the process of generating mature granule cells from adult neural stem cells-occurs throughout the entire lifetime. In order to investigate the involved regulatory mechanisms, knockout (KO) experiments, which modify the dynamic behaviour of this process, were conducted in the past. Evaluating these KOs is a non-trivial task owing to the complicated nature of the hippocampal neurogenic niche. In this study, we model neurogenesis as a multicompartmental system of ordinary differential equations based on experimental data. To analyse the results of KO experiments, we investigate how changes of cell properties, reflected by model parameters, influence the dynamics of cell counts and of the experimentally observed counts of cells labelled by the cell division marker bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). We find that changing cell proliferation rates or the fraction of self-renewal, reflecting the balance between symmetric and asymmetric cell divisions, may result in multiple time phases in the response of the system, such as an initial increase in cell counts followed by a decrease. Furthermore, these phases may be qualitatively different in cells at different differentiation stages and even between mitotically labelled cells and all cells existing in the system.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>11 (94), Art.

They yielded evidence that chromosomes occupy distinct territories in the mammalian cell nucleus, first obtained with laser-UV-microbeam experiments and thereafter with chromosome painting, and contributed to the development of interphase cytogenetics and comparative genome hybridization. We provide a personal account of experimental concepts, which were developed by us and others, and describe some of the unforeseeable turns and obstacles, which we had to overcome on the way towards an experimental realization.

Elucidation of the transport processes of bilirubin conjugates across the basolateral (sinusoidal) and the canalicular plasma membrane domains of hepatocytes has decisively contributed to our current understanding of the molecular basis of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia in human liver diseases. Under normal conditions, unconjugated bilirubin is taken up into hepatocytes by transporters of the organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) family, followed by conjugation with glucuronic acid, and ATP-dependent transport into bile. This efflux across the canalicular membrane is mediated by multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2 or ABCC2), which is a 190-kDa glycoprotein transporting with high affinity and efficiency monoglucuronosyl bilirubin and bisglucuronosyl bilirubin into bile. MRP2 is hereditarily deficient in human Dubin-Johnson syndrome. Under pathophysiological conditions such as cholestatic liver injury and MRP2 inhibition, the basolateral efflux pump multidrug resistance protein 3 (MRP3 or ABCC3) is responsible for the occurrence of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. MRP3 is a glycoprotein with a similar molecular mass as MRP2, with 48% amino acid identity, and with overlapping substrate specificity. Human MRP3 is the only basolateral efflux pump shown to transport bilirubin glucuronides. In human and rat hepatocytes, MRP3/Mrp3 is strongly upregulated under conditions of cholestasis and MRP2 deficiency. This is in line with the concept that basolateral efflux pumps of the hepatocyte compensate for impaired canalicular efflux of compounds into bile and contribute to balance the rate of uptake or synthesis of compounds in hepatocytes with the capacity for efflux into bile.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>42 (4), 561-565</Feld596><PubVol>42</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>561</StrtPage><EndPage>565</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Keppler D" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24459177</PMID><DOI>10.1124/dmd.113.055772</DOI><KST>M018</KST><KEYWORD>BILIRUBIN LEVELS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EFFLUX PUMPS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BASOLATERAL HEPATOCYTE MEMBRANE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DUBIN-JOHNSON-SYNDROME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPORT PUMP</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL-LINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>UP-REGULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RAT-LIVER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MULTIDRUG-RESISTANCE PROTEIN-2</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ORGANIC ANION-TRANSPORTER</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49213</publishedID><Artikel>Microenvironmental clues for glioma immunotherapy</Artikel><Journal>Current Neurology and Neuroscience Reports</Journal><ABSTr>Gliomas have been viewed for decades as inaccessible for a meaningful antitumor immune response as they grow in a sanctuary site protected from infiltrating immune cells. Moreover, the glioma microenvironment constitutes a hostile environment for an efficient antitumor immune response as glioma-derived factors such as transforming growth factor beta and catabolites of the essential amino acid tryptophan paralyze T-cell function. There is growing evidence from preclinical and clinical studies that a meaningful antitumor immunity exists in glioma patients and that it can be activated by vaccination strategies. As a consequence, the concept of glioma immunotherapy appears to be experiencing a renaissance with the first phase 3 randomized immunotherapy trials entering the clinical arena. On the basis of encouraging results from other tumor entities using immunostimulatory approaches by blocking endogenous T-cell suppressive pathways mediated by cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 or programmed cell death protein 1/programmed cell death protein 1 ligand 1 with humanized antibodies, there is now a realistic and promising option to combine active immunotherapy with agents blocking the immunosuppressive microenvironment in patients with gliomas to allow a peripheral antitumor immune response induced by vaccination to become effective. Here we review the current clinical and preclinical evidence of antimicroenvironment immunotherapeutic strategies in gliomas.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>14 (4), Art.

Owing to its relatively slow growth, perspectives for effective early detection are much better than for other forms of cancer. AIM: To summarize the evidence on effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of CRC screening, and to provide an overview on the current state and perspectives for effective CRC screening. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Summary and critical review of evidence from randomized trials and observational epidemiological studies. RESULTS: A reduction in CRC mortality by offering annual fecal occult blood tests or once-only flexible sigmoidoscopy has been demonstrated in randomized trials. Novel fecal immunochemical tests for hemoglobin in stool have been shown to be more sensitive than traditional fecal occult blood tests and could substantially improve noninvasive CRC screening. Epidemiological studies suggest that the majority of CRC cases and deaths could be prevented by colonoscopy and removal of colorectal adenomas. However, adherence to screening offered outside organized screening programs is low. The National Cancer Plan recommends an organized CRC screening program in Germany. The law on the early detection of cancer from April 2013 has paved the way for its implementation. DISCUSSION: The great potential for CRC prevention by early detection has so far only been realized to a very limited extent in Germany. Introduction of an organized screening program and the offer of enhanced noninvasive screening tests could strongly enhance the utilization and effectiveness of CRC screening in Germany. The political frame has been set, and timely quality-assured implementation is required.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>57 (3), 302-306</Feld596><PubVol>57</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>302</StrtPage><EndPage>306</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Hoffmeister M" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24562704</PMID><KST>C070</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PARTICIPANTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>colonography</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEGATIVE COLONOSCOPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OCCULT BLOOD-TESTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>sigmoidoscopy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADENOMAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COST-EFFECTIVENESS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POPULATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49242</publishedID><Artikel>Development of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies for oncogenic human papillomavirus types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58</Artikel><Journal>Clinical and Vaccine Immunology</Journal><ABSTr>Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the etiological agent for all cervical cancers, a significant number of other anogenital cancers, and a growing number of head and neck cancers. Two licensed vaccines offer protection against the most prevalent oncogenic types, 16 and 18, responsible for approximately 70% of cervical cancer cases worldwide and one of these also offers protection against types 6 and 11, responsible for 90% of genital warts. The vaccines are comprised of recombinantly expressed major capsid proteins that self-assemble into virus-like particles (VLPs) and prevent infection by eliciting neutralizing antibodies. Adding the other frequently identified oncogenic types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 to a vaccine would increase the coverage against HPV-induced cancers to approximately 90%. We describe the generation and characterization of panels of monoclonal antibodies to these five additional oncogenic HPV types, and the selection of antibody pairs that were high affinity and type specific and recognized conformation-dependent neutralizing epitopes. Such characteristics make these antibodies useful tools for monitoring the production and potency of a prototype vaccine as well as monitoring vaccine-induced immune responses in the clinic.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>21 (4), 587-593</Feld596><PubVol>21</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>587</StrtPage><EndPage>593</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Brown MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Seitz H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Towne V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Mueller M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Finnefrock AC" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24574536</PMID><DOI>10.1128/CVI.00773-13</DOI><KST>F035</KST><KEYWORD>INFECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CLASSIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VIRUS-LIKE PARTICLES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASSAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WOMEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>L1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPITOPES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>pseudovirions</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REACTIVITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GARDASIL(R)</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49243</publishedID><Artikel>miR-34 Cooperates with p53 in Suppression of Prostate Cancer by Joint Regulation of Stem Cell Compartment</Artikel><Journal>Cell Reports</Journal><ABSTr>The miR-34 family was originally found to be a direct target of p53 and is a group of putative tumor suppressors. Surprisingly, mice lacking all mir-34 genes show no increase in cancer formation by 18 months of age, hence placing the physiological relevance of previous studies in doubt. Here, we report that mice with prostate epithelium-specific inactivation of mir-34 and p53 show expansion of the prostate stem cell compartment and develop early invasive adenocarcinomas and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, whereas no such lesions are observed after inactivation of either the mir-34 or p53 genes alone by 15 months of age. Consistently, combined deficiency of p53 and miR-34 leads to acceleration of MET-dependent growth, self-renewal, and motility of prostate stem/progenitor cells. Our study provides direct genetic evidence that mir-34 genes are bona fide tumor suppressors and identifies joint control of MET expression by p53 and miR-34 as a key component of prostate stem cell compartment regulation, aberrations in which may lead to cancer.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>6 (6), 1000-1007</Feld596><PubVol>6</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>1000</StrtPage><EndPage>1007</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Cheng CY" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Hwang CI" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Corney DC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Flesken-Nikitin A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Jiang L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Oner GM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Munroe RJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Schimenti JC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Hermeking H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Nikitin AY" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24630988</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.celrep.2014.02.023</DOI><KST>L701</KST><KEYWORD>PC3 CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>senescence</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOUSE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NETWORK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MODEL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>proliferation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIFFERENTIATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49245</publishedID><Artikel>Glycated Hemoglobin Measurement and Prediction of Cardiovascular Disease</Artikel><Journal>JAMA - Journal of the American Medical Association</Journal><ABSTr>IMPORTANCE The value of measuring levels of glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) for the prediction of first cardiovascular events is uncertain.

OBJECTIVE To determine whether adding information on HbA(1c) values to conventional cardiovascular risk factors is associated with improvement in prediction of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Analysis of individual-participant data available from 73 prospective studies involving 294 998 participants without a known history of diabetes mellitus or CVD at the baseline assessment.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Measures of risk discrimination for CVD outcomes (eg, C-index) and reclassification (eg, net reclassification improvement) of participants across predicted 10-year risk categories of low (&lt;5%), intermediate (5% to &lt;7.5%), and high (&gt;= 7.5%) risk.

RESULTS During a median follow-up of 9.9 (interquartile range, 7.6-13.2) years, 20 840 incident fatal and nonfatal CVD outcomes (13 237 coronary heart disease and 7603 stroke outcomes) were recorded. In analyses adjusted for several conventional cardiovascular risk factors, there was an approximately J-shaped association between HbA(1c) values and CVD risk. The association between HbA(1c) values and CVD risk changed only slightly after adjustment for total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations or estimated glomerular filtration rate, but this association attenuated somewhat after adjustment for concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and C-reactive protein. The C-index for a CVD risk prediction model containing conventional cardiovascular risk factors alone was 0.7434 (95% CI, 0.7350 to 0.7517). The addition of information on HbA(1c) was associated with a C-index change of 0.0018 (0.0003 to 0.0033) and a net reclassification improvement of 0.42 (-0.63 to 1.48) for the categories of predicted 10-year CVD risk. The improvement provided by HbA(1c) assessment in prediction of CVD risk was equal to or better than estimated improvements for measurement of fasting, random, or postload plasma glucose levels.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In a study of individuals without known CVD or diabetes, additional assessment of HbA(1c) values in the context of CVD risk assessment provided little incremental benefit for prediction of CVD risk.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>311 (12), 1225-1233</Feld596><PubVol>311</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>1225</StrtPage><EndPage>1233</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Di Angelantonio,E."

Radiation biological considerations are based on the assumption that the alpha/beta value for prostate cancer cells is 1.5 Gy, so that a biologically more effective dose could be administered due to hypofractionation without increasing risks of late effects of bladder (alpha/beta = 4.0) and rectum (alpha/beta = 3.9). METHODS/DESIGN: The IPI study is a prospective randomized phase II study exploring the safety and feasibility of primary hypofractionated irradiation of the prostate with protons and carbon ions in a raster scan technique. The study is designed to enroll 92 patients with localized prostate cancer. Primary aim is the assessment of the safety and feasibility of the study treatment on the basis of incidence grade III and IV NCI-CTC-AE (v. 4.02) toxicity and/or the dropout of the patient from the planned therapy due to any reason. Secondary endpoints are PSA-progression free survival (PSA-PFS), overall survival (OS) and quality-of-life (QoL). DISCUSSION: This pilot study aims at the evaluation of the safety and feasibility of hypofractionated irradiation of the prostate with protons and carbon ions in prostate cancer patients in an active beam technique. Additionally, the safety results will be compared with Japanese results recently published for carbon ion irradiation. Due to the missing data of protons in this hypofractionated scheme, an in depth evaluation of the toxicity will be created to gain basic data for a following comparison study with carbon ion irradiation.

We demonstrate that mutation patterns in immortalised cell lines derived from primary murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exposed in vitro to carcinogens recapitulate key features of mutational signatures observed in human cancers. In experiments with several cancer-causing agents we obtained high genome-wide concordance between human tumour mutation data and in vitro data with respect to predominant substitution types, strand bias and sequence context. Moreover, we found signature mutations in well-studied human cancer driver genes. To explore endogenous mutagenesis, we used MEFs ectopically expressing activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and observed an excess of AID signature mutations in immortalised cell lines compared to their non-transgenic counterparts. MEF immortalisation is thus a simple and powerful strategy for modelling cancer mutation landscapes that facilitates the interpretation of human tumour genome-wide sequencing data.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>4 (), Art.

We show here that prolonged Nrf2 activation in keratinocytes causes sebaceous gland enlargement and seborrhea in mice due to upregulation of the growth factor epigen, which we identified as a novel Nrf2 target. This was accompanied by thickening and hyperkeratosis of hair follicle infundibula. These abnormalities caused dilatation of infundibula, hair loss, and cyst development upon aging. Upregulation of epigen, secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor (Slpi), and small proline-rich protein 2d (Sprr2d) in hair follicles was identified as the likely cause of infundibular acanthosis, hyperkeratosis, and cyst formation. These alterations were highly reminiscent to the phenotype of chloracne/"metabolizing acquired dioxin-induced skin hamartomas" (MADISH) patients. Indeed, SLPI, SPRR2, and epigen were strongly expressed in cysts of MADISH patients and upregulated by dioxin in human keratinocytes in an NRF2-dependent manner. These results identify novel Nrf2 activities in the pilosebaceous unit and point to a role of NRF2 in MADISH pathogenesis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>6 (4), 442-457</Feld596><PubVol>6</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>442</StrtPage><EndPage>457</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schaefer M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Willrodt AH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kurinna S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Link AS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Farwanah H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Geusau A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Gruber F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Sorg O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Huebner AJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Roop DR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Sandhoff K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Saurat JH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Tschachler E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Schneider MR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Langbein L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Bloch W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="16" name="Beer HD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Werner S" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24503019</PMID><DOI>10.1002/emmm.201303281</DOI><KST>A110</KST><KEYWORD>IDENTIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>epidermal barrier</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SULFORAPHANE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OXIDATIVE STRESS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIFFERENTIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EMPHYSEMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIOXIN</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49249</publishedID><Artikel>A CagA-independent cluster of antigens related to the risk of noncardia gastric cancer: Associations between Helicobacter pylori antibodies and gastric adenocarcinoma explored by multiplex serology</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Because of the differences in bacterial epitopes and host characteristics, infections with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) induce different immune responses. We explored the possibility that certain antibody response patterns are more closely linked to gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) than others. In a Swedish population-based case-control study, serum samples were obtained from 268 cases and 222 controls, aged 40-79 years and frequency-matched according to age and sex. We measured antibodies against 17 H. pylori proteins using multiplex serology. Associations were estimated with multivariably adjusted logistic regression models, using odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) as measures of relative risk. Associations were essentially confined to non-cardia GAC but did not differ significantly between intestinal and diffuse subtypes. Point estimates for all antibodies were above unity, 15 significant with top three being CagA (OR = 9.2), GroEL (6.6), HyuA (3.6). ORs were substantially attenuated in individuals with chronic atrophic gastritis. Principal component analysis identified two significant factors: a CagA-dominant factor (antibodies against CagA, VacA and Omp as prominent markers), and a non-CagA factor (antibodies against NapA and Catalase as prominent markers). Both factors showed dose-dependent associations with non-cardia GAC risk (CagA-dominant factor, highest vs. lowest quartiles, OR = 16.2 [95% CI 4.8-54.9]; non-CagA factor OR = 5.3 [95% CI 2.1-13.3]). Overall, our results confirm that serum antibodies against different H. pylori proteins are associated with the presence of non-cardia GAC. Although strongest association is detected by antibodies against CagA and covarying proteins, a pattern of antibodies unrelated to CagA is also significantly linked to the risk of non-cardia GAC.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>134 (12), 2942-2950</Feld596><PubVol>134</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>2942</StrtPage><EndPage>2950</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Song H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Michel A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Nyren O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Ekstrom AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Pawlita M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Ye W" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24259284</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28621</DOI><KST>F020</KST><KEYWORD>DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>carcinoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INFECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BIOMARKERS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CARDIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ERADICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>chronic atrophic gastritis</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BODY GASTRITIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMMUNOBLOT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49250</publishedID><Artikel>Vestibular effects of a 7 Tesla MRI examination compared to 1.5 T and 0 T in healthy volunteers</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>Ultra-high-field MRI (7 Tesla (T) and above) elicits more temporary side-effects compared to 1.5 T and 3 T, e.g. dizziness or "postural instability" even after exiting the scanner. The current study aims to assess quantitatively vestibular performance before and after exposure to different MRI scenarios at 7 T, 1.5 T and 0 T. Sway path and body axis rotation (Unterberger's stepping test) were quantitatively recorded in a total of 46 volunteers before, 2 minutes after, and 15 minutes after different exposure scenarios: 7 T head MRI (n = 27), 7 T no RF (n = 22), 7 T only B0 (n = 20), 7 T in &amp; out B0 (n = 20), 1.5 T no RF (n = 20), 0 T (n = 15). All exposure scenarios lasted 30 minutes except for brief one minute exposure in 7 T in &amp; out B0. Both measures were documented utilizing a 3D ultrasound system. During sway path evaluation, the experiment was repeated with eyes both open and closed. Sway paths for all long-lasting 7 T scenarios (normal, no RF, only B0) with eyes closed were significantly prolonged 2 minutes after exiting the scanner, normalizing after 15 minutes. Brief exposure to 7 T B0 or 30 minutes exposure to 1.5 T or 0 T did not show significant changes. End positions after Unterberger's stepping test were significantly changed counter-clockwise after all 7 T scenarios, including the brief in &amp; out B0 exposure. Shorter exposure resulted in a smaller alteration angle. In contrast to sway path, reversal of changes in body axis rotation was incomplete after 15 minutes. 1.5 T caused no rotational changes. The results show that exposure to the 7 Tesla static magnetic field causes only a temporary dysfunction or "over-compensation" of the vestibular system not measurable at 1.5 or 0 Tesla. Radiofrequency fields, gradient switching, and orthostatic dysregulation do not seem to play a role.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (3), e92104-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>e92104</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Theysohn JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Kraff O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Eilers K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Andrade D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Gerwig M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Timmann D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Schmitt F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Ladd ME" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Ladd SC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Bitz AK" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24658179</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0092104</DOI><KST>E020</KST><KEYWORD>SAFETY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPOSURE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SYSTEMS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STATIC MAGNETIC-FIELDS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STRAY FIELDS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CROSSOVER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VERTIGO</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49251</publishedID><Artikel>The improved physical activity index for measuring physical activity in EPIC Germany</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>In the European Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study (EPIC), physical activity (PA) has been indexed as a cross-tabulation between PA at work and recreational activity. As the proportion of non-working participants increases, other categorization strategies are needed. Therefore, our aim was to develop a valid PA index for this population, which will also be able to express PA continuously. In the German EPIC centers Potsdam and Heidelberg, a clustered sample of 3,766 participants was re-invited to the study center. 1,615 participants agreed to participate and 1,344 participants were finally included in this study. PA was measured by questionnaires on defined activities and a 7-day combined heart rate and acceleration sensor. In a training sample of 433 participants, the Improved Physical Activity Index (IPAI) was developed. Its performance was evaluated in a validation sample of 911 participants and compared with the Cambridge Index and the Total PA Index. The IPAI consists of items covering five areas including PA at work, sport, cycling, television viewing, and computer use. The correlations of the IPAI with accelerometer counts in the training and validation sample ranged r = 0.40-0.43 and with physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) r = 0.33-0.40 and were higher than for the Cambridge Index and the Total PA Index previously applied in EPIC. In non-working participants the IPAI showed higher correlations than the Cambridge Index and the Total PA Index, with r = 0.34 for accelerometer counts and r = 0.29 for PAEE. In conclusion, we developed a valid physical activity index which is able to express PA continuously as well as to categorize participants according to their PA level. In populations with increasing rates of non-working people the performance of the IPAI is better than the established indices used in EPIC.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (3), e92005-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>e92005</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Wientzek A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Vigl M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Steindorf K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Bruehmann B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Bergmann MM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Harttig U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Katzke V" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Kaaks R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24642812</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0092005</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KST>G110</KST><KEYWORD>ACCELEROMETERS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VALIDITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>nutrition</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RELIABILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REPEATABILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVITY QUESTIONNAIRE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADULTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEART-RATE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49274</publishedID><Artikel>Transitioning from Genotypes to Epigenotypes: Why the Time Has Come for Medulloblastoma Epigenomics</Artikel><Journal>Neuroscience</Journal><ABSTr>Recent advances in genomic technologies have allowed for tremendous progress in our understanding of the biology underlying medulloblastoma, a malignant childhood brain tumor. Consensus molecular subgroups have been put forth by the pediatric neuro-oncology community and next-generation genomic studies have led to an improved description of driver genes and pathways somatically altered in these subgroups. In contrast to the impressive pace at which advances have been made at the level of the medulloblastoma genome, comparable studies of the epigenome have lagged behind. Complementary data yielded from genomic sequencing and copy number profiling have verified frequent targeting of chromatin modifiers in medulloblastoma, highly suggestive of prominent epigenetic deregulation in the disease. Past studies of DNA methylation-dependent gene silencing and microRNA expression analyses further support the concept of medulloblastoma as an epigenetic disease. In this Review, we aim to summarize the key findings of past reports pertaining to medulloblastoma epigenetics as well as recent and ongoing genomic efforts linking somatic alterations of the genome with inferred deregulation of the epigenome. In addition, we predict what is on the horizon for medulloblastoma epigenetics and how aberrant changes in the medulloblastoma epigenome might serve as an attractive target for future therapies.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>264 (), 171-185</Feld596><PubVol>264</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>171</StrtPage><EndPage>185</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Batora,N.V."

The aim of the study was to investigate significance and costs of biopsychosocial health care needs in elderly people. Methods: Data were derived from the 8-year follow-up of the ESTHER study-a German epidemiological study in the elderly population. A total of 3124 participants aged 57 to 84 years were visited at home by trained medical doctors. Biopsychosocial health care needs were assessed using the INTERMED for the Elderly (IM-E) interview. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) was measured by the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey, and psychosomatic burden was measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire. Results: The IM-E correlated with decreased mental (mental component score: r = -0.38, p &lt; .0001) and physical HRQOL (physical component score: r = -0.45, p &lt; .0001), increased depression severity (r = 0.53, p &lt; .0001), and costs (R = 0.41, p &lt; .0001). The proportion of the participants who had an IM-E score of at least 21 was 8.2%; according to previous studies, they were classified as complex patients (having complex biopsychosocial health care needs). Complex patients showed a highly reduced HRQOL compared with participants without complex health care needs (mental component score: 37.0 [10.8] versus 48.7 [8.8]; physical component score: 33.0 [9.1] versus 41.6 [9.5]). Mean health care costs per 3 months of complex patients were strongly increased (1651.1 (sic) [3192.2] versus 764.5 (sic) [1868.4]). Conclusions: Complex biopsychosocial health care needs are strongly associated with adverse health outcomes in elderly people. It should be evaluated if interdisciplinary treatment plans would improve the health outcomes for complex patients.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>76 (7), 497-502</Feld596><PubVol>76</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>497</StrtPage><EndPage>502</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Wild B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Heider D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Maatouk I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Slaets J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Koenig HH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Niehoff D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Saum KU" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Soenner W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Herzog W" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25121639</PMID><DOI>10.1097/PSY.0000000000000080</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>depression</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OLDER-ADULTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PREVALENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RELIABILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MULTIMORBIDITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Generalized anxiety disorder</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RANDOMIZED-CONTROLLED-TRIAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTEGRATED CARE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MEDICALLY ILL</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49378</publishedID><Artikel>Association of vitamin D status with arterial blood pressure and hypertension risk: a mendelian randomisation study</Artikel><Journal>Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology</Journal><ABSTr>Background Low plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentration is associated with high arterial blood pressure and hypertension risk, but whether this association is causal is unknown. We used a mendelian randomisation approach to test whether 25(OH)D concentration is causally associated with blood pressure and hypertension risk.

Methods In this mendelian randomisation study, we generated an allele score (25[OH]D synthesis score) based on variants of genes that affect 25(OH)D synthesis or substrate availability (CYP2R1 and DHCR7), which we used as a proxy for 25(OH)D concentration. We meta-analysed data for up to 108 173 individuals from 35 studies in the D-CarDia collaboration to investigate associations between the allele score and blood pressure measurements. We complemented these analyses with previously published summary statistics from the International Consortium on Blood Pressure (ICBP), the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium, and the Global Blood Pressure Genetics (Global BPGen) consortium.

Findings In phenotypic analyses (up to n=49 363), increased 25(OH) D concentration was associated with decreased systolic blood pressure (beta per 10% increase, -0.12 mm Hg, 95% CI -0.20.to -0.04; p=0.003) and reduced odds of hypertension (odds ratio [OR] 0.98, 95% CI 0.97-0.99; p=0.0003), but not with decreased diastolic blood pressure (beta per 10% increase, -0.02 mm Hg, -0.08 to 0.03; p=0.37). In meta-analyses in which we combined data from D-CarDia and the ICBP (n=146 581, after exclusion of overlapping studies), each 25(OH)D-increasing allele of the synthesis score was associated with a change of -0.10 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure (-0.21 to -0.0001; p=0.0498) and a change of -0.08 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure (-0.15 to -0.02; p=0.01). When D-CarDia and consortia data for hypertension were meta-analysed together (n=142 255), the synthesis score was associated with a reduced odds of hypertension (OR per allele, 0.98, 0.96-0.99; p=0.001). In instrumental variable analysis, each 10% increase in genetically instrumented 25(OH) D concentration was associated with a change of -0.29 mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure (-0.52 to -0.07; p=0.01), a change of -0.37 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure (-0.73 to 0.003; p=0.052), and an 8 1% decreased odds of hypertension (OR 0.92, 0.87-0.97; p=0.002).

Interpretation Increased plasma concentrations of 25(OH)D might reduce the risk of hypertension. This finding warrants further investigation in an independent, similarly powered study.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>2 (9), 719-729</Feld596><PubVol>2</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>719</StrtPage><EndPage>729</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Vimaleswaran,K.S."

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within apoptosis-related genes could affect apoptotic responses and their identification might provide a basis to assess individual risk for development of early lesions. To investigate a possible association between genetic polymorphisms and the occurrence of hyperplastic polyps (HP), we developed a custom DNA chip assay for 1,536 SNPs in the coding and flanking regions of 826 genes with known functional roles in apoptosis or apoptosis-associated (e. g., stress-related) pathways. During a first round of screening, genotypes were determined for 272 endoscopy patients harboring hyperplastic colorectal polyps and for 512 sex and aged-matched controls. A set of 14 candidate SNPs associated with HP (P &lt; 0.01) was then evaluated in an independent cohort of patients (n = 38) and controls (n = 38). Following meta-analysis of Stages I and II, a false discovery rate approach was applied. Among the 14 candidate SNPs, eight showed significant association (combined P &lt; 0.01) with the occurrence of HP. The SNPs rs4709583 (PARK2) and rs10476823 (HDAC3) were analyzed for potential functional effects on RNA splicing and RNA half-life. Despite its location near a splice site, alternative splicing was not detected for rs4709583 (PARK3). By contrast, cDNA analysis revealed use of a cryptic polyadenylation signal in the 3'UTR of HDAC3 mRNA and a longer mRNA half-life in a cell line heterozygous for rs10476823.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>53 (9), 769-778</Feld596><PubVol>53</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>769</StrtPage><EndPage>778</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Gerola S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Nittka S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kaehler G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Tao S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Binelli G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Eils R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Brors B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Neumaier M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24861865</PMID><DOI>10.1002/gcc.22185</DOI><KST>B080</KST><KST>C070</KST><KST>G200</KST><KEYWORD>POLYPS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FALSE DISCOVERY RATE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL-PROLIFERATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MESSENGER-RNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIVER METASTASES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STABILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLON-CANCER</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49386</publishedID><Artikel>Parent-of-origin specific allelic associations among 106 genomic loci for age at menarche</Artikel><Journal>Nature</Journal><ABSTr>Age at menarche is a marker of timing of puberty in females. It varies widely between individuals, is a heritable trait and is associated with risks for obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, breast cancer and all-causemortality(1). Studies of rare human disorders of puberty and animal models point to a complex hypothalamic-pituitary-hormonal regulation(2,3), but the mechanisms that determine pubertal timing and underlie its links to disease risk remain unclear. Here, using genome-wide and custom-genotyping arrays in up to 182,416 women of European descent from 57 studies, we found robust evidence (P &lt; 5 x 10(-8)) for 123 signals at 106 genomic loci associated with age at menarche. Many loci were associated with other pubertal traits in both sexes, and there was substantial overlap with genes implicated in body mass index and various diseases, including rare disorders of puberty. Menarche signals were enriched in imprinted regions, with three loci (DLK1-WDR25, MKRN3-MAGEL2 and KCNK9) demonstrating parent-of-origin-specific associations concordant with known parental expression patterns. Pathway analyses implicated nuclear hormone receptors, particularly retinoic acid and gamma-aminobutyric acid-B2 receptor signalling, among novel mechanisms that regulate pubertal timing in humans. Our findings suggest a genetic architecture involving at least hundreds of common variants in the coordinated timing of the pubertal transition.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>514 (7520), 92-97</Feld596><PubVol>514</PubVol><PubIss>7520</PubIss><StrtPage>92</StrtPage><EndPage>97</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Perry,J.R.B."

Proton transfer between creatine and surrounding solvent water is underlying the chemical exchange saturation transfer used as a contrast in magnetic resonance imaging. The free energy barrier, determined by first-principles umbrella sampling simulations (E-a(DFT) 3 kcal/mol) is in the same order of magnitude as the experimentally obtained activation energy. The underlying mechanism is a first proton transfer from the guanidinium group to the water pool, followed by a second transition where a proton is "transferred back" from the nearest water molecule to the deprotonated nitrogen atom of creatine.

Materials and Methods: Seven patients with PAOD were examined on a 7-T whole-body magnetic resonance system. A custom-built 16-channel transmit/receive coil and a manually positionable AngioSURF table were used for multi-station imaging. For ne-MRA, an axial T1-weighted Turbo-fast low angle shot sequence (repetition time, 700 milliseconds; echo time, 3.84 milliseconds; bandwidth, 930 Hz/pixel; voxel volume, 1 x 1 x 2 mm(3); matrix, 384 x 288) with phonocardiogram gating was acquired at 7 T. Acquisition time of an entire angiogram covering the vasculature from pelvis to feet amounted to approximately 30 minutes, depending on the patient's heart frequency. All patients underwent a contrast-enhanced MRA (ce-MRA) at 1.5 T as standard of reference. The presence of stenosis and occlusions was evaluated segment based and compared for both MRA techniques. The degree of stenosis was defined as low grade (&lt;50%), high grade (50%-99%), and occlusion (100%). High-grade stenosis and occlusion were considered to be hemodynamically significant stenosis.

Results: The 7-T ne-MRA enabled a homogenous, hyperintense artery signal and nearly total venous suppression with accurate delineation of arterial anatomy both proximal and distal to stenotic disease. A total of 154 artery segments were depicted with ce-MRA at 1.5 T. At 7 T, only 124 segments (80.5%) were displayed and involved for analysis, as the iliacal region was displayed incompletely in 4 patients because of the fact that the fixed coil diameter was too small to contain the lower abdomen and pelvis of these patients. In comparison with ce-MRA at 1.5 T as the reference standard, there was total agreement regarding the characterization of an artery segment as being normal or having any kind of stenosis. Of the 124 included segments, 28 segments (23%) had hemodynamically significant stenosis evaluated with 7-T ne-MRA and 26 segments (21%) assessed with 1.5-T ce-MRA. The sensitivity and specificity values of 7-T ne-MRA for detecting segments with hemodynamically significant stenosis were 93% and 98%, respectively.

Conclusions: Non-contrast-enhanced MRA by means of T1-weighted Turbo-fast low angle shot imaging at 7 T in patients with PAOD is feasible and allowed for good visualization of stenosis and occlusions in all analyzed artery segments in this small patient group. However, this study also shows the challenges of ultrahigh-field body imaging, and more experience is required to determine the impact of 7-T ne-MRA in clinical practice.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>49 (5), 331-338</Feld596><PubVol>49</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>331</StrtPage><EndPage>338</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Fischer,A."

Research suggests that immunomodulatory properties of vitamin D may influence LRTI risk. This study's objective was to examine whether 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations in cord blood influenced susceptibility to LRTI in the first year of life. Data was analyzed from a prospective birth cohort of 777 mother-infant pairs based in Ulm, Germany. Relative risks (RRs) of LRTI in relation to 25(OH)D cord blood levels were estimated by log-binomial regression after adjustment for potential confounders. To account for seasonal variation in both vitamin D levels and infections, we examined the association in different seasons. Analyses were conducted using clinical predefined cutpoints, quartiles, and season-standardized 25(OH)D quartiles. We observed a statistically significant association between 25(OH)D status in cord blood and risk of LRTI across the year using clinical cutpoints. The adjusted RR of LRTI for individuals with vitamin D deficiency (&lt; 25 nmol/L) in comparison to the referent category (&gt; 50 nmol/L) was 1.32 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.00, 1.73]. The association differed by maternal allergy status; children born to mothers without allergy demonstrated a RR of 1.45 (95 % CI 1.03, 2.03). The effect was largely driven by a strong association between 25(OH)D and LRTI in infants born in fall with a RR of 3.07 (95 % CI 1.37, 6.87). Our findings suggest that vitamin D deficiency at birth is associated with increased risk of LRTI particularly in infants born to mothers without allergy. The association seems strongest in infants born in fall.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>29 (8), 585-594</Feld596><PubVol>29</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>585</StrtPage><EndPage>594</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Łuczyńska A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Logan C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Nieters A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Elgizouli M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Florath I" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Schoettker B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Rothenbacher D" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24859820</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s10654-014-9918-z</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>innate immunity</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INFANTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEWBORN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PREGNANCY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>YOUNG-CHILDREN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>asthma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VITAMIN-D STATUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>D DEFICIENCY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>25-HYDROXYVITAMIN D LEVELS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49417</publishedID><Artikel>Noninvasive positron emission tomography and fluorescence imaging of CD133+ tumor stem cells</Artikel><Journal>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</Journal><ABSTr>A technology that visualizes tumor stem cells with clinically relevant tracers could have a broad impact on cancer diagnosis and treatment.

Here we demonstrate the successful noninvasive detection of AC133(+) tumor stem cells by PET and near-infrared fluorescence molecular tomography in subcutaneous and orthotopic glioma xenografts using antibody-based tracers. Particularly, microPET with (64)Cu-NOTA-AC133 mAb yielded high-quality images with outstanding tumor-to-background contrast, clearly delineating subcutaneous tumor stem cell-derived xenografts from surrounding tissues. Intracerebral tumors as small as 2-3 mm also were clearly discernible, and the microPET images reflected the invasive growth pattern of orthotopic cancer stem cell-derived tumors with low density of AC133(+) cells. These data provide a basis for further preclinical and clinical use of the developed tracers for high-sensitivity and high-resolution monitoring of AC133(+) tumor stem cells.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>111 (6), E692-701</Feld596><PubVol>111</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>E692</StrtPage><EndPage>701</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Gaedicke S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Braun F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Prasad S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Machein M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Firat E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hettich M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Gudihal R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Zhu X" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Klingner K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Schuler J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Herold-Mende CC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Grosu AL" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Behe M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Weber W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="14" name="Maecke H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Niedermann G" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24469819</PMID><KST>L601</KST></row><row><publishedID>49418</publishedID><Artikel>[Importance of PET for surgery of gastrointestinal stromal tumors]</Artikel><Journal>Chirurg</Journal><ABSTr>Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most common mesenchymal neoplasm of the digestive tract. The GIST differ substantially from gastrointestinal carcinomas regarding tumor biology, treatment strategies and indications for surgery. Every surgeon involved in the treatment of GIST should be acquainted with these aspects.

The aims of this article are to discuss the value of positron emission tomography (PET) in the surgical treatment of patients with GIST and to provide an outlook on the development of molecular tracers specifically tailored for GIST.

PET is an invaluable decision aid in the multimodal therapy of GIST and particularly for deciding on surgical indications. Specific scenarios in which PET is used are primary staging monitoring during neoadjuvant therapy and staging and response assessment in the metastatic setting. The routinely used tracer is 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) and uptake reliably correlates with the metabolism of GIST lesions. Compared to computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI), 18F-FDG-PET often allows a more timely and accurate response assessment. GIST-specific molecular tracers, which could provide a direct prognosis regarding response and development of resistance to treatment, are currently in preclinical development. However, pharmacokinetic and immunological issues still need to be resolved. A distant aim is the development of "theranostics", i.e. substances which serve both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

PET has an established value in the multimodal treatment of GIST and is particularly useful for deciding on surgical indications.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>85 (6), 493-499</Feld596><PubVol>85</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>493</StrtPage><EndPage>499</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ronellenfitsch,U."

Design Meta-analysis of individual participant data of eight prospective cohort studies from Europe and the US.
Setting General population.
Participants 26 018 men and women aged 50-79 years
Main outcome measures All-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality.
Results 25(OH) D concentrations varied strongly by season (higher in summer), country (higher in US and northern Europe) and sex (higher in men), but no consistent trend with age was observed. During follow-up, 6695 study participants died, among whom 2624 died of cardiovascular diseases and 2227 died of cancer. For each cohort and analysis, 25(OH) D quintiles were defined with cohort and subgroup specific cut-off values. Comparing bottom versus top quintiles resulted in a pooled risk ratio of 1.57 (95% CI 1.36 to 1.81) for all-cause mortality. Risk ratios for cardiovascular mortality were similar in magnitude to that for all-cause mortality in subjects both with and without a history of cardiovascular disease at baseline. With respect to cancer mortality, an association was only observed among subjects with a history of cancer (risk ratio, 1.70 (1.00 to 2.88)). Analyses using all quintiles suggest curvilinear, inverse, dose-response curves for the aforementioned relationships. No strong age, sex, season, or country specific differences were detected. Heterogeneity was low in most meta-analyses.
Conclusions Despite levels of 25(OH) D strongly varying with country, sex, and season, the association between 25(OH) D level and all-cause and cause-specific mortality was remarkably consistent. Results from a long term randomised controlled trial addressing longevity are being awaited before vitamin D supplementation can be recommended in most individuals with low 25(OH) D levels.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>348 (), g3656-</Feld596><PubVol>348</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>g3656</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Schoettker B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Jorde R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Peasey A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Thorand B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Jansen EHJM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="de Groot l" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Streppel M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Gardiner J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Ordóňez-Mena JM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Perna L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Wilsgaard T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Rathmann W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Feskens E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Kampman E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Siganos G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Njølstad I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Mathiesen EB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Kubinová R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Pajak A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Topor-Madry R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Tamosiunas A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Hughes M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Kee F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Bobak M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Boffetta P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="27" name="on behalf of the Consortium on Health and Ageing" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Network of cohorts in Europe and the United States (CHANCES)" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24938302</PMID><DOI>10.1136/bmj.g3656</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>INTERVENTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPIDEMIOLOGY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OLDER-ADULTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MONICA/KORA AUGSBURG</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENERAL-POPULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SERUM 25-HYDROXYVITAMIN D</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49429</publishedID><Artikel>Possible combinations of electronic data capture and randomization systems. Principles and the realization with RANDI2 and OpenClinica</Artikel><Journal>Methods of Information in Medicine</Journal><ABSTr>Background: Clinical trials (CT) are in a, wider sense experiments to prove and establish clinical benefit of treatments. Nowadays; electronic data capture systems (EDCS) are used more often bringing a better data management and higher data quality into clinical practice. Also electronic systems for the randomization are used to assign the patients to the treatments.

Objectives: If the mentioned randomization system (RS) and EDCS are used, possibly identical data are collected in both, especially by stratified randomization. This separated data storage may lead to data inconsistency and in general data samples have to be aligned. The article discusses solutions to combine RS and EDCS. In detail one approach is realized and introduced.

Methods: Different possible settings of combination of EDCS and RS are determined and the pros and cons for each solution are worked out. For the combination of two in-dependent applications the necessary interfaces for the communication are defined. Thereby, existing standards are considered. An example realization is implemented with the help of open-source applications and state-of-the-art software development procedures.

Results:Three possibilities of separate usage or combination of EDCS and RS are presented and assessed: i) the complete independent usage of both systems; ii) realization of one system with both functions; and iii) two separate systems, which communicate via defined interfaces. In addition a realization of our preferred approach, the combination of both systems, is introduced using the open source tools RANDI2 and OpenClinica.

Conclusion: The advantage of a flexible independent development of EDCS and RS is shown based on the fact that these tool are very different featured. In our opinion the combination of both systems via defined interfaces fulfills the requirements of randomization and electronic data capture and is feasible in practice. In addition, the use of such a setting can reduce the training costs and the error-prone duplicated data entry.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>53 (3), 202-207</Feld596><PubVol>53</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>202</StrtPage><EndPage>207</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schrimpf,D."

Impaired expression of E-cadherin has been associated with disrupted tissue homeostasis, progression of cancer and a worse patient prognosis. So far, the role of E-cadherin in homeostasis and carcinogenesis of the liver is not well understood. By use of a mouse model with liver-specific deletion of E-cadherin and administration of the carcinogen diethylnitrosamin, we demonstrate that loss of E-cadherin expression in hepatocytes results in acceleration of the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In contrast, liver regeneration is not disturbed in mice lacking E-cadherin expression in hepatocytes. In human HCC we observed four different expression patterns of E-cadherin. Notably, atypical cytosolic expression of E-cadherin was positively correlated with a poorer patient prognosis: The median overall survival of patients with HCC expressing E-cadherin on the membrane only was 221 weeks (95% confidence interval (CI), 51-391) compared to 131 weeks in patients with cytosolic expression (95% CI, 71 - 191 weeks; p&lt;0.05). In conclusion, we demonstrate that impaired expression of E-cadherin promotes hepatocellular carcinogenesis and is associated with a worse prognosis in humans.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>35 (8), 1855-1862</Feld596><PubVol>35</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>1855</StrtPage><EndPage>1862</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schneider MR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Hiltwein F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Grill J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Blum H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Krebs S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Klanner A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Bauersachs S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Bruns C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Longerich T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Horst D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Kriegl L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="de Toni E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Herbst A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Kolligs FT" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24840851</PMID><DOI>10.1093/carcin/bgu109</DOI><KST>L701</KST><KEYWORD>TUMOR PROGRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH-FACTOR RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>hepatitis</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>snail</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49432</publishedID><Artikel>Therapeutic targeting of naturally presented myeloperoxidase-derived HLA peptide ligands on myeloid leukemia cells by TCR-transgenic T cells</Artikel><Journal>Leukemia</Journal><ABSTr>T cells have been proven to be therapeutically effective in patients with relapsed leukemias, although target antigens on leukemic cells as well as T-cell receptors (TCRs), potentially recognizing those antigens, are mostly unknown. We have applied an immunopeptidomic approach and isolated human leukocyte antigen (HLA) ligands from primary leukemia cells. We identified a number of ligands derived from different genes that are restrictedly expressed in the hematopoietic system. We exemplarily selected myeloperoxidase (MPO) as a potential target and isolated a high-avidity TCR with specificity for a HLA-B*07:02-(HLA-B7)-restricted epitope of MPO in the single HLA-mismatched setting. T cells transgenic for this TCR demonstrated high peptide and antigen specificity as well as leukemia reactivity in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, no significant on- and off-target toxicity could be observed. In conclusion, we here demonstrate, exemplarily for MPO, that leukemia-derived HLA ligands can be selected for specific effector tool development to redirect T cells to be used for graft manipulation or adoptive T-cell therapies in diverse transplant settings. This approach can be extended to other HLA ligands and HLA molecules in order to provide better treatment options for this life-threatening disease.Leukemia advance online publication, 13 May 2014; doi:10.1038/leu.2014.131.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>28 (12), 2355-2366</Feld596><PubVol>28</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>2355</StrtPage><EndPage>2366</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Klar R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Schober S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Rami M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Mall S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Merl J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hauck SM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Ueffing M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Admon A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Slotta-Huspenina J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Schwaiger M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Stevanovic S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Oostendorp RA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Busch DH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Peschel C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="14" name="Krackhardt AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24736212</PMID><DOI>10.1038/leu.2014.131</DOI><KST>L701</KST></row><row><publishedID>49433</publishedID><Artikel>The role of therapeutic leukapheresis in hyperleukocytotic AML</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: Hyperleukocytosis in AML with leukostasis is a serious life-threatening condition leading to a high early mortality which requires immediate cytoreductive therapy. Therapeutic leukapheresis is currently recommended by the American Society of Apheresis in patients with a WBC&gt;100 G/l with signs of leukostasis, but the role of prophylactic leukapheresis before clinical signs of leukostasis occur is unclear. PATIENTS: We retrospectively analyzed the role of leukapheresis in 52 patients (median age 60 years) with hyperleukocytotic AML with and without clinical signs of leukostasis. Since leukapheresis was performed more frequently in patients with signs of leukostasis due to the therapeutic policy in our hospital, we developed a risk score for early death within seven days after start of therapy (EDd7) to account for this selection bias and to independently measure the effect of leukapheresis on EDd7. RESULTS: 20 patients received leukapheresis in combination to chemotherapy compared to 32 patients who received chemotherapy only. In a multivariate logistic regression model for the estimation of the probability of EDd7 thromboplastin time and creatinine remained as independent significant parameters and were combined to create an EDd7 risk score. The effect of leukapheresis on EDd7 was evaluated in a bivariate logistic regression together with the risk score. Leukapheresis did not significantly change early mortality in all patients with a WBC&gt;/=100 G/l. DISCUSSION: Prophylactic leukapheresis in hyperleukocytotic patients with and without leukostasis did not improve early mortality in our retrospective study. Larger and prospective clinical trials are needed to validate the risk score and to further explore the role of leukapheresis in AML with hyperleukocytosis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (4), e95062-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>e95062</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Pastore F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Pastore A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Wittmann G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Hiddemann W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Spiekermann K" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24733550</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0095062</DOI><KST>L701</KST><KEYWORD>ACUTE MYELOID-LEUKEMIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MANAGEMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACUTE MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INDUCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGNOSTIC-SIGNIFICANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EARLY MORTALITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TANDEM DUPLICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LEUKOSTASIS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49439</publishedID><Artikel>Oncogenic KRAS signalling in pancreatic cancer</Artikel><Journal>British Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is almost universally fatal. The annual number of deaths equals the number of newly diagnosed cases, despite maximal treatment. The overall 5-year survival rate of &lt;5% has remained stubbornly unchanged over the last 30 years, despite tremendous efforts in preclinical and clinical science. There is unquestionably an urgent need to further improve our understanding of pancreatic cancer biology, treatment response and relapse, and to identify novel therapeutic targets. Rigorous research in the field has uncovered genetic aberrations that occur during PDAC development and progression. In most cases, PDAC is initiated by oncogenic mutant KRAS, which has been shown to drive pancreatic neoplasia. However, all attempts to target KRAS directly have failed in the clinic and KRAS is widely assumed to be undruggable. This has led to intense efforts to identify druggable critical downstream targets and nodes orchestrated by mutationally activated KRAS. This includes context-specific KRAS effector pathways, synthetic lethal interaction partners and KRAS-driven metabolic changes. Here, we review recent advances in oncogenic KRAS signalling and discuss how these might benefit PDAC treatment in the future.British Journal of Cancer advance online publication 22 April 2014; doi:10.1038/bjc.2014.215 www.bjcancer.com.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>111 (5), 817-822</Feld596><PubVol>111</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>817</StrtPage><EndPage>822</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Eser S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Schnieke A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Schneider G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Saur D" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24755884</PMID><DOI>10.1038/bjc.2014.215</DOI><KST>L701</KST><KEYWORD>PLUS GEMCITABINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EGF RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOUSE MODEL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>K-RAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INHIBITION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LUNG-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>C-RAF</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49496</publishedID><Artikel>Comparison of gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced breast MRI and gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced breast MRI with mammography and ultrasound for the detection of breast cancer</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging</Journal><ABSTr>Purpose

To compare gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI, mammography, and ultrasound for breast cancer detection across different malignant lesion types and across different densities of breast tissue.

Materials and Methods

In all, 153 women with Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) 3-5 findings on mammography and/or ultrasound underwent identical breast MRI exams at 1.5T with gadobenate dimeglumine and gadopentetate dimeglumine. Images were evaluated by three independent blinded radiologists. Mammography, ultrasound, and combined mammography and/or ultrasound findings were available for 108, 109, and 131 women. Imaging findings were matched with histology data by a fourth, independent, blinded radiologist. Malignant lesion detection rates and diagnostic performance were compared.

Results

In all, 120, 120, and 140 confirmed malignant lesions were present in patients undergoing MRI+mammography, MRI+ultrasound, and MRI+mammography and/or ultrasound, respectively. Significantly greater cancer detection rates were noted by all three readers for comparisons of gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI with mammography (Delta 15.8-17.5%; P &lt; 0.0001), ultrasound (Delta 18.3-20.0%; P &lt; 0.0001), and mammography and/or ultrasound (Delta 8.6-10.7%; P &lt;= 0.0105) but not for comparisons of gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI with conventional techniques (P &gt; 0.05). The false-positive detection rates were lower on gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI than on conventional imaging (4.0-5.5% vs. 11.1% at mammography; 6.3-8.4% vs. 15.5% at ultrasound). Significantly improved cancer detection on MRI was noted in heterogeneously dense breast (91.2-97.3% on gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI vs. 77.2-84.9% on gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI vs. 71.9-84.9% with conventional techniques) and for invasive cancers (93.2-96.2% for invasive ductal carcinoma [IDC] on gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI vs. 79.7-88.5% on gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI vs. 77.0-84.4% with conventional techniques). Overall diagnostic performance for the detection of cancer was superior on gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI than on conventional imaging or gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI.

Conclusion

Gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI significantly improves cancer detection compared to gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI, mammography, and ultrasound in a selected group of patients undergoing breast MRI for preoperative staging or because of inconclusive findings at conventional imaging.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>39 (5), 1272-1286</Feld596><PubVol>39</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>1272</StrtPage><EndPage>1286</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Gilbert,F.J."

However, weaker mechanisms of insertional mutagenesis could still pose a significant risk in clinical applications. Taking advantage of novel in vivo genotoxicity assays, we tested a battery of LV constructs, including some with clinically relevant designs, and found that oncogene activation by promoter insertion is the most powerful mechanism of early vector-induced oncogenesis. SIN LVs disabled in their capacity to activate oncogenes by promoter insertion were less genotoxic and induced tumors by enhancer-mediated activation of oncogenes with efficiency that was proportional to the strength of the promoter used. On the other hand, when enhancer activity was reduced by using moderate promoters, oncogenesis by inactivation of tumor suppressor gene was revealed. This mechanism becomes predominant when the enhancer activity of the internal promoter is shielded by the presence of a synthetic chromatin insulator cassette. Our data provide both mechanistic insights and quantitative readouts of vector-mediated genotoxicity, allowing a relative ranking of different vectors according to these features, and inform current and future choices of vector design with increasing biosafety.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>22 (4), 774-785</Feld596><PubVol>22</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>774</StrtPage><EndPage>785</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Cesana D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Ranzani M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Volpin M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Bartholomae C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Duros C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Artus A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Merella S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Benedicenti F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Sergi Sergi L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Sanvito F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Brombin C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Nonis A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Serio CD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Doglioni C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="von Kalle C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Schmidt M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="16" name="Cohen-Haguenauer O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Naldini L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Montini E" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24441399</PMID><DOI>10.1038/mt.2014.3</DOI><KST>G100</KST><KEYWORD>MAGNETIC-RESONANCE-MAMMOGRAPHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HIGH-RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONTRAST AGENTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DOUBLE-BLIND</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MULTICENTER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIAGNOSTIC-ACCURACY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BRAIN-TUMORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>image interpretation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LESION DETECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>3 TESLA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49500</publishedID><Artikel>Association between high dietary intake of the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid and reduced risk of Crohn's disease</Artikel><Journal>Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: There are plausible mechanisms for how dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, could prevent Crohn's disease (CD). AIM: To conduct a prospective study to investigate the association between increased intake of DHA and risk of CD. METHODS: Overall, 229 702 participants were recruited from nine European centres between 1991 and 1998. At recruitment, dietary intakes of DHA and fatty acids were measured using validated food frequency questionnaires. The cohort was monitored through to June 2004 to identify participants who developed incident CD. In a nested case-control analysis, each case was matched with four controls; odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for quintiles of DHA intake, adjusted for total energy intake, smoking, other dietary fatty acids, dietary vitamin D and body mass index. RESULTS: Seventy-three participants developed incident CD. All higher quintiles of DHA intake were inversely associated with development of CD; the highest quintile had the greatest effect size (OR = 0.07; 95% CI = 0.02-0.81). The OR trend across quintiles of DHA was 0.54 (95% CI = 0.30-0.99, Ptrend = 0.04). Including BMI in the multivariate analysis, due to its correlation with dietary fat showed similar associations. There were no associations with the other dietary fatty acids studied. CONCLUSION: There were inverse associations, with a biological gradient between increasing dietary docosahexaenoic acid intakes and incident Crohn's disease. Further studies in other populations should measure docosahexaenoic acid to determine if the association is consistent and the hypothesis tested in randomised controlled trials of purely docosahexaenoic acid supplementation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>39 (8), 834-842</Feld596><PubVol>39</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>834</StrtPage><EndPage>842</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Chan SS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Luben R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Olsen A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kaaks R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Lindgren S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Grip O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Bergmann MM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Hallmans G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Karling P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Veno SK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="van Schaik F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Oldenburg B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Hart AR" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24611981</PMID><DOI>10.1111/apt.12670</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>OMEGA-3-FATTY-ACIDS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>prostaglandin</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INFLAMMATORY-BOWEL-DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EICOSAPENTAENOIC ACID</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LINOLEIC-ACID</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ULCERATIVE-COLITIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ARACHIDONIC-ACID</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METABOLISM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EUROPEAN PROSPECTIVE COHORT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIPID MEDIATORS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49501</publishedID><Artikel>The classification and diagnosis of cutaneous lupus erythematosus</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Autoimmunity</Journal><ABSTr>Lupus erythematosus (LE) is an inflammatory connective tissue disease of generalized autoimmunity characterized by pathogenic autoantibodies and immune complexes, attributed to loss of immune tolerance. Cutaneous involvement, which appears in the majority of patients with the disease, can present as LE-specific or LE-nonspecific manifestations. The LE-nonspecific manifestations include e.g. vascular skin changes and may be associated with systemic organ manifestations or other autoimmune diseases. In contrast, the LE-specific manifestations encompass the various subtypes of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE), which are classified as separate entities without or with less severe systemic organ involvement. In the "Duesseldorf Classification", CLE is subdivided into four different categories: acute CLE (ACLE), subacute CLE (SCLE), chronic CLE (CCLE), and intermittent CLE (ICLE). Differentiation between these subtypes is based on clinical features and average duration of the cutaneous lesions, but can also consider histological changes of skin biopsy specimens and laboratory abnormalities. In addition, direct immunofluorescence and photoprovocation may be applied to confirm the diagnosis in specific cases. Further investigations should be considered dependent on the clinical symptoms of the CLE patient and the results of the laboratory tests. A revised scoring system, the Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (RCLASI) has recently been validated to assess disease activity and damage in CLE. In this review, we focus on the classification of CLE and the diagnostic procedures to identify and confirm the different subtypes of the disease.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>48-49 (), 14-9</Feld596><PubVol>48-49</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>14</StrtPage><EndPage>9</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kuhn A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Landmann A" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24486120</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.jaut.2014.01.021</DOI><KST>D030</KST><KEYWORD>CORE SET QUESTIONNAIRE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OUTCOME INSTRUMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVITY INDEXES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SEVERITY INDEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISEASE AREA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BAND TEST</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MULTICENTER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CRITERIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MANIFESTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EUROPEAN-SOCIETY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49502</publishedID><Artikel>Infiltrative patterns of glioblastoma: Identification of tumor progress using apparent diffusion coefficient histograms</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: To investigate whether apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) histogram analysis can differentiate between patients presenting T2-progress and patients presenting stable T2-signal in glioblastoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients presenting an isolated T2-progress and a matched control group exhibiting stable disease were included. Relative ADC value distribution within tumoral and peritumoral FLAIR hyperintensities were evaluated using ADC-histogram analysis. Severity and frequency of ADC shift between baseline, T2-progress, and subsequent T1-progress were analyzed using the Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: The shift of ADC histograms either to higher or to lower values in case of T2-progress was significantly more severe than in the control group (P value 0.05). Furthermore, a significant shift toward lower ADC values (P value 0.02) was detected when comparing ADC histograms of patients with T2-progress and subsequent T1-progress. CONCLUSION: The basis for the observed ADC shift in isolated T2-progress may be time dependent: Initially, formation of peritumoral edema may cause an increase of ADC values that is followed by tumor cells infiltrating the surrounding tissue, causing a subsequent decrease of ADC values. The shift toward lower ADC values in case of subsequent T1-progress confirms this hypothesis and provides further evidence for T2-progress being an intermediate step between stable disease (SD) and T1-progress.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>39 (5), 1096-103</Feld596><PubVol>39</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>1096</StrtPage><EndPage>103</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Lutz K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Wiestler B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Graf M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Baumer P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Floca R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Schlemmer HP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Heiland S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Wick W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Bendszus M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Radbruch A" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24115401</PMID><DOI>10.1002/jmri.24258</DOI><KST>E010</KST><KST>G370</KST><KST>E071</KST><KST>E012</KST><KEYWORD>RESPONSE ASSESSMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HIGH-GRADE GLIOMAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BRAIN-TUMORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MALIGNANT GLIOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REGISTRATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MAGNETIC-RESONANCE-SPECTROSCOPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIFFERENTIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MRI</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTUAL-INFORMATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RELAXATION-TIMES</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49503</publishedID><Artikel>IL-6R/STAT3/miR-34a feedback loop promotes EMT-mediated colorectal cancer invasion and metastasis</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Clinical Investigation</Journal><ABSTr>Members of the miR-34 family are induced by the tumor suppressor p53 and are known to inhibit epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and therefore presumably suppress the early phases of metastasis. Here, we determined that exposure of human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells to the cytokine IL-6 activates the oncogenic STAT3 transcription factor, which directly represses the MIR34A gene via a conserved STAT3-binding site in the first intron. Repression of MIR34A was required for IL-6-induced EMT and invasion. Furthermore, we identified the IL-6 receptor (IL-6R), which mediates IL-6-dependent STAT3 activation, as a conserved, direct miR-34a target. The resulting IL-6R/STAT3/miR-34a feedback loop was present in primary colorectal tumors as well as CRC, breast, and prostate cancer cell lines and associated with a mesenchymal phenotype. An active IL-6R/STAT3/miR-34a loop was necessary for EMT, invasion, and metastasis of CRC cell lines and was associated with nodal and distant metastasis in CRC patient samples. p53 activation in CRC cells interfered with IL-6-induced invasion and migration via miR-34a-dependent downregulation of IL6R expression. In Mir34a-deficient mice, colitis-associated intestinal tumors displayed upregulation of p-STAT3, IL-6R, and SNAIL and progressed to invasive carcinomas, which was not observed in WT animals. Collectively, our data indicate that p53-dependent expression of miR-34a suppresses tumor progression by inhibiting a IL-6R/STAT3/miR-34a feedback loop.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>124 (4), 1853-1867</Feld596><PubVol>124</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>1853</StrtPage><EndPage>1867</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Rokavec M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Oner MG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Li H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Jackstadt R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Jiang L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Lodygin D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Kaller M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Horst D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Ziegler PK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Schwitalla S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Slotta-Huspenina J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Bader FG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Greten FR" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Hermeking H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24642471</PMID><DOI>10.1172/JCI73531</DOI><KST>L501</KST><KST>L701</KST><KEYWORD>DOWN-REGULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL-SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLON-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR PROGRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>C-MYC</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOUSE MODEL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>beta-catenin</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>inflammation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPITHELIAL-MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLITIS-ASSOCIATED CANCER</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49504</publishedID><Artikel>Ceritinib in ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer</Artikel><Journal>New England Journal of Medicine</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring the anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK) rearrangement is sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib, but resistance invariably develops. Ceritinib (LDK378) is a new ALK inhibitor that has shown greater antitumor potency than crizotinib in preclinical studies. METHODS: In this phase 1 study, we administered oral ceritinib in doses of 50 to 750 mg once daily to patients with advanced cancers harboring genetic alterations in ALK. In an expansion phase of the study, patients received the maximum tolerated dose. Patients were assessed to determine the safety, pharmacokinetic properties, and antitumor activity of ceritinib. Tumor biopsies were performed before ceritinib treatment to identify resistance mutations in ALK in a group of patients with NSCLC who had had disease progression during treatment with crizotinib. RESULTS: A total of 59 patients were enrolled in the dose-escalation phase. The maximum tolerated dose of ceritinib was 750 mg once daily; dose-limiting toxic events included diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, elevated aminotransferase levels, and hypophosphatemia. This phase was followed by an expansion phase, in which an additional 71 patients were treated, for a total of 130 patients overall. Among 114 patients with NSCLC who received at least 400 mg of ceritinib per day, the overall response rate was 58% (95% confidence interval [CI], 48 to 67). Among 80 patients who had received crizotinib previously, the response rate was 56% (95% CI, 45 to 67). Responses were observed in patients with various resistance mutations in ALK and in patients without detectable mutations. Among patients with NSCLC who received at least 400 mg of ceritinib per day, the median progression-free survival was 7.0 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 9.5). CONCLUSIONS: Ceritinib was highly active in patients with advanced, ALK-rearranged NSCLC, including those who had had disease progression during crizotinib treatment, regardless of the presence of resistance mutations in ALK.

Dose measurement and calculation in MRT is challenging because of the spatial accuracy required and the arising high dose differences. Dose calculation with Monte Carlo simulations is time consuming and their accuracy is still a matter of debate. In particular, the influence of photon polarization has been discussed in the literature. Moreover, it is controversial whether a complete knowledge of phase space trajectories, i.e., the simulation of the machine from the wiggler to the collimator, is necessary in order to accurately calculate the dose. METHODS: With Monte Carlo simulations in the Geant4 toolkit, the authors investigate the influence of polarization on the dose distribution and the therapeutically important peak to valley dose ratios (PVDRs). Furthermore, the authors analyze in detail phase space information provided by Martinez-Rovira et al. ["Development and commissioning of a Monte Carlo photon model for the forthcoming clinical trials in microbeam radiation therapy," Med. Phys. 39(1), 119-131 (2012)] and examine its influence on peak and valley doses. A simple source model is developed using parallel beams and its applicability is shown in a semiadjoint Monte Carlo simulation. Results are compared to measurements and previously published data. RESULTS: Polarization has a significant influence on the scattered dose outside the microbeam field. In the radiation field, however, dose and PVDRs deduced from calculations without polarization and with polarization differ by less than 3%. The authors show that the key consequences from the phase space information for dose calculations are inhomogeneous primary photon flux, partial absorption due to inclined beam incidence outside the field center, increased beam width and center to center distance due to the beam propagation from the collimator to the phantom surface and imperfect absorption in the absorber material of the Multislit Collimator. These corrections have an effect of approximately 10% on the valley dose and suffice to describe doses in MRT within the measurement uncertainties of currently available dosimetry techniques. CONCLUSIONS: The source for the first clinical pet trials in MRT is characterized with respect to its phase space and the photon polarization. The results suggest the use of a presented simplified phase space model in dose calculations and hence pave the way for alternative and fast dose calculation algorithms. They also show that the polarization is of minor importance for the clinical important peak and valley doses inside the microbeam field.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>41 (4), Art.

We report a case of MCC in an inguinal lymph node of a patient with Von Willebrand disease (VWD), who underwent multiple blood transfusions following haemorrhoidectomy.

Recent attractor-network models suggest an essential role for GABAergic interneurons in the emergence of the grid-cell firing pattern through recurrent inhibition dependent on grid-cell phase. To test this hypothesis, we studied identified parvalbumin-expressing (PV(+)) interneurons that are the most likely candidate for providing this recurrent inhibition onto grid cells. Using optogenetics and tetrode recordings in mice, we found that PV(+) interneurons exhibited high firing rates, low spatial sparsity and no spatial periodicity. PV(+) interneurons inhibited all functionally defined cell types in the MEC and were in turn recruited preferentially by grid cells. To our surprise, we found that individual PV(+) interneurons received input from grid cells with various phases, which most likely accounts for the broadly tuned spatial firing activity of PV(+) interneurons. Our data argue against the notion that PV(+) interneurons provide phase-dependent recurrent inhibition and challenge recent attractor-network models of grid cells.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>17 (5), 710-718</Feld596><PubVol>17</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>710</StrtPage><EndPage>718</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Buetfering C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Allen K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Monyer H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24705183</PMID><DOI>10.1038/nn.3696</DOI><KST>A230</KST><KEYWORD>NEURONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MAP</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATH-INTEGRATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GAMMA OSCILLATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>hippocampus</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MODEL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RAT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OLFACTORY-BULB OUTPUT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POSITIVE INTERNEURONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHASE PRECESSION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49539</publishedID><Artikel>A high-performance thioredoxin-based scaffold for peptide immunogen construction: proof-of-concept testing with a human papillomavirus epitope</Artikel><Journal>Scientific Reports</Journal><ABSTr>Escherichia coli thioredoxin has been previously exploited as a scaffold for the presentation/stabilization of peptide aptamers as well as to confer immunogenicity to peptide epitopes. Here we focused on other key features of thioredoxin that are of general interest for the production of safer and more effective peptide immunogens, such as a high thermal stability, lack of cross-reactivity and a low-cost of production. We identified thioredoxin from the archaebacterium Pyrococcus furiosus (PfTrx) as a novel scaffold meeting all the above criteria. PfTrx is a highly thermostable and protease-resistant scaffold with a strong (poly)peptide solubilisation capacity. Anti-PfTrx antibodies did not cross-react with mouse, nor human thioredoxin. Untagged PfTrx bearing a previously identified HPV16-L2 peptide epitope was obtained in a &gt;90% pure form with a one-step thermal purification procedure and effectively elicited the production of neutralizing anti-HPV antibodies. We thus propose PfTrx as a superior, general-purpose scaffold for the construction of safe, stable, and low-cost peptide immunogens.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>4 (), Art.

Cancer patients have often known their general practitioners (GPs) for years and are often in constant contact with them. Objective(s). We examined German GPs' views on their involvement in the care of cancer patients. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 German GPs. Purposeful sampling was applied to secure maximum heterogeneity. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and then analyzed using qualitative content analysis according to Mayring. RESULTS: GPs perceive a clear involvement in the latter phase of cancer care but a mainly sporadic role (as and when required) in earlier phases. They think that greater care contributions from GPs are generally beneficial to cancer patients, as their ability to take the patient's history, surroundings and co-morbidities into account enables them to provide more patient-centred care. GPs want to stay involved and to know how their cancer patients are progressing, and they complain about slow or non-existent information sharing between providers, as well as insufficient care coordination. They pro-actively try to overcome these obstacles through direct contact with patients and physicians, and by building networks of trusted care providers. CONCLUSIONS: Given their long-lasting and close relationships with cancer patients, GPs are in a position to accompany them throughout the whole process of cancer care. However, such general involvement is as yet uncommon. Shared care models may have the potential to take into account the complementary character of primary and specialist care.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>31 (2), 209-214</Feld596><PubVol>31</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>209</StrtPage><EndPage>214</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Dahlhaus A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Vanneman N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Guethlin C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Behrend J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Siebenhofer A" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24465025</PMID><DOI>10.1093/fampra/cmt088</DOI><KST>L501</KST><KEYWORD>ONCOLOGY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURVIVORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMMUNICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FAMILY PHYSICIANS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49541</publishedID><Artikel>Loss of Tet enzymes compromises proper differentiation of embryonic stem cells</Artikel><Journal>Developmental Cell</Journal><ABSTr>Tet enzymes (Tet1/2/3) convert 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and are dynamically expressed during development. Whereas loss of individual Tet enzymes or combined deficiency of Tet1/2 allows for embryogenesis, the effect of complete loss of Tet activity and 5hmC marks in development is not established. We have generated Tet1/2/3 triple-knockout (TKO) mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and examined their developmental potential. Combined deficiency of all three Tets depleted 5hmC and impaired ESC differentiation, as seen in poorly differentiated TKO embryoid bodies (EBs) and teratomas. Consistent with impaired differentiation, TKO ESCs contributed poorly to chimeric embryos, a defect rescued by Tet1 reexpression, and could not support embryonic development. Global gene-expression and methylome analyses of TKO EBs revealed promoter hypermethylation and deregulation of genes implicated in embryonic development and differentiation. These findings suggest a requirement for Tet- and 5hmC-mediated DNA demethylation in proper regulation of gene expression during ESC differentiation and development.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>29 (1), 102-111</Feld596><PubVol>29</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>102</StrtPage><EndPage>111</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Dawlaty MM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Breiling A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Le T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Barrasa MI" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Raddatz G" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Gao Q" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Powell BE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Cheng AW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Faull KF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Lyko F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Jaenisch R" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24735881</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.devcel.2014.03.003</DOI><KST>A130</KST><KEYWORD>5-HYDROXYMETHYLCYTOSINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>5-CARBOXYLCYTOSINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MAMMALIAN DNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>conversion</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SELF-RENEWAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>5-methylcytosine</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SPECIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA methylation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEINS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49542</publishedID><Artikel>Genome-wide association study of subtype-specific epithelial ovarian cancer risk alleles using pooled DNA</Artikel><Journal>Human Genetics</Journal><ABSTr>Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a heterogeneous cancer with both genetic and environmental risk factors. Variants influencing the risk of developing the less-common EOC subtypes have not been fully investigated. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of EOC according to subtype by pooling genomic DNA from 545 cases and 398 controls of European descent, and testing for allelic associations. We evaluated for replication 188 variants from the GWAS [56 variants for mucinous, 55 for endometrioid and clear cell, 53 for low-malignant potential (LMP) serous, and 24 for invasive serous EOC], selected using pre-defined criteria. Genotypes from 13,188 cases and 23,164 controls of European descent were used to perform unconditional logistic regression under the log-additive genetic model; odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals are reported. Nine variants tagging six loci were associated with subtype-specific EOC risk at P &lt; 0.05, and had an OR that agreed in direction of effect with the GWAS results. Several of these variants are in or near genes with a biological rationale for conferring EOC risk, including ZFP36L1 and RAD51B for mucinous EOC (rs17106154, OR = 1.17, P = 0.029, n = 1,483 cases), GRB10 for endometrioid and clear cell EOC (rs2190503, P = 0.014, n = 2,903 cases), and C22orf26/BPIL2 for LMP serous EOC (rs9609538, OR = 0.86, P = 0.0043, n = 892 cases). In analyses that included the 75 GWAS samples, the association between rs9609538 (OR = 0.84, P = 0.0007) and LMP serous EOC risk remained statistically significant at P &lt; 0.0012 adjusted for multiple testing. Replication in additional samples will be important to verify these results for the less-common EOC subtypes.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>133 (5),

cells</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Immunology</Journal><ABSTr>Sulforaphane (SFN), an isothiocyanate, is part of an important group of naturally occurring small molecules with anti-inflammatory properties. The published reports are best conceivable with an inhibition of T cell function, but the mode of action remains unknown. We therefore analyzed the effect of SFN on T cell-mediated autoimmune disease. Feeding mice with SFN protected from severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Disease amelioration was associated with reduced IL-17 and IFN-gamma expression in draining lymph nodes. In vitro, SFN treatment of T cells did not directly alter T cell cytokine secretion. In contrast, SFN treatment of dendritic cells (DCs) inhibited TLR4-induced IL-12 and IL-23 production, and severely suppressed Th1 and Th17 development of T cells primed by SFN-treated DCs. SFN regulated the activity of the TLR4-induced transcription factor NF-kappaB, without affecting the degradation of its inhibitor IkappaB-alpha. Instead, SFN treatment of DCs resulted in strong expression of the stress response protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which interacts with and thereby inhibits NF-kappaB p65. Consistent with these findings, HO-1 bound to p65 and subsequently inhibited the p65 activity at the IL23a and IL12b promoters. Importantly, SFN suppressed Il23a and Il12b expression in vivo and silenced Th17/Th1 responses within the CNS. Thus, our data show that SFN improves Th17/Th1-mediated autoimmune disease by inducing HO-1 and inhibiting NF-kappaB p65-regulated IL-23 and IL-12 expression.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>192 (8), 3530-3539</Feld596><PubVol>192</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>3530</StrtPage><EndPage>3539</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Geisel J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Bruck J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Glocova I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Dengler K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Sinnberg T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Rothfuss O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Walter M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Schulze-Osthoff K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Rocken M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Ghoreschi K" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24639357</PMID><DOI>10.4049/jimmunol.1300556</DOI><KST>L801</KST><KEYWORD>TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR NRF2</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHEMOPREVENTIVE AGENT SULFORAPHANE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PLACEBO-CONTROLLED PHASE-3</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ORAL BG-12</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>cancer chemoprevention</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEME OXYGENASE-1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OXIDATIVE STRESS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NF-KAPPA-B</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49544</publishedID><Artikel>Highly emissive water-soluble tetraazaperopyrenes as fluorescent markers</Artikel><Journal>Chemical Communications</Journal><ABSTr>Water-soluble tetraazaperopyrene (TAPP) derivatives have been synthesized, which show both high photostability and high fluorescence quantum yields (&gt;80%) in water.

METHOD: Published glioblastoma trials reporting OS and ORR and/or PFS with sufficient detail were included in correlative analyses using weighted linear regression. RESULTS: Of 274 published unique glioblastoma trials, 91 were included. PFS and OS hazard ratios were strongly correlated; R(2) = 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-0.99). Linear regression determined that a 10% PFS risk reduction would yield an 8.1% +/- 0.8% OS risk reduction. R(2) between median PFS and median OS was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.59-0.79), with a higher value in trials using Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO; R(2) = 0.96, n = 8) versus Macdonald criteria (R(2) = 0.70; n = 83). No significant differences were demonstrated between temozolomide- and bevacizumab-containing regimens (P = .10) or between trials using RANO and Macdonald criteria (P = .49). The regression line slope between median PFS and OS was significantly higher in newly diagnosed versus recurrent disease (0.58 vs 0.35, P = .04). R(2) for 6-month PFS with 1-year OS and median OS were 0.60 (95% CI, 0.37-0.77) and 0.64 (95% CI, 0.42-0.77), respectively. Objective response rate and OS were poorly correlated (R(2) = 0.22). CONCLUSION: In glioblastoma, PFS and OS are strongly correlated, indicating that PFS may be an appropriate surrogate for OS. Compared with OS, PFS offers earlier assessment and higher statistical power at the time of analysis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>16 (5), 696-706</Feld596><PubVol>16</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>696</StrtPage><EndPage>706</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Han K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Ren M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Wick W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Abrey L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Das A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Jin J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Reardon DA" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24335699</PMID><DOI>10.1093/neuonc/not236</DOI><KST>G370</KST><KEYWORD>MULTIAGENT CHEMOTHERAPY PROCARBAZINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SINGLE INSTITUTION EXPERIENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STANDARD RADIATION-THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METASTATIC COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEWLY-DIAGNOSED GLIOBLASTOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BRAIN-TUMOR CONSORTIUM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECURRENT MALIGNANT GLIOMAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BEVACIZUMAB PLUS IRINOTECAN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHASE-II TRIAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HIGH-GRADE GLIOMAS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49547</publishedID><Artikel>Interferon-beta induces loss of spherogenicity and overcomes therapy resistance of glioblastoma stem cells</Artikel><Journal>Molecular Cancer Therapeutics</Journal><ABSTr>Glioblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in adults and characterized by a poor prognosis. Glioma cells expressing O(6)-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) exhibit a higher level of resistance toward alkylating agents, including the standard of care chemotherapeutic agent temozolomide. Here, we demonstrate that long-term glioma cell lines (LTL) as well as glioma-initiating cell lines (GIC) express receptors for the immune modulatory cytokine IFN-beta and respond to IFN-beta with induction of STAT-3 phosphorylation. Exposure to IFN-beta induces a minor loss of viability, but strongly interferes with sphere formation in GIC cultures. Furthermore, IFN-beta sensitizes LTL and GIC to temozolomide and irradiation. RNA interference confirmed that both IFN-beta receptors, R1 and R2, are required for IFN-beta-mediated sensitization, but that sensitization is independent of MGMT or TP53. Most GIC lines are highly temozolomide-resistant, mediated by MGMT expression, but nevertheless susceptible to IFN-beta sensitization. Gene expression profiling following IFN-beta treatment revealed strong upregulation of IFN-beta-associated genes, including a proapoptotic gene cluster, but did not alter stemness-associated expression signatures. Caspase activity and inhibition studies revealed the proapoptotic genes to mediate glioma cell sensitization to exogenous death ligands by IFN-beta, but not to temozolomide or irradiation, indicating distinct pathways of death sensitization mediated by IFN-beta. Thus, IFN-beta is a potential adjunct to glioblastoma treatment that may target the GIC population. IFN-beta operates independently of MGMT-mediated resistance, classical apoptosis-regulatory networks, and stemness-associated gene clusters.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>13 (4), 948-961</Feld596><PubVol>13</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>948</StrtPage><EndPage>961</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Happold C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Roth P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Silginer M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Florea AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Lamszus K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Frei K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Deenen R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Reifenberger G" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Weller M" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24526161</PMID><DOI>10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-13-0772</DOI><KST>L401</KST><KEYWORD>temozolomide</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MGMT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IFN-BETA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MALIGNANT GLIOMA-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHARMACOKINETICS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>sensitivity</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR INITIATING CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CD95L-INDUCED APOPTOSIS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49548</publishedID><Artikel>Prediction of treatment response in head and neck carcinomas using IVIM-DWI: Evaluation of lymph node metastasis</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Radiology</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: To obtain diffusion and microperfusion measures in lymph node metastases of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) using intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) imaging. The obtained IVIM parameters were used to characterize lymph nodes in the staging phase and longitudinal follow-up was performed to evaluate the potential predictive value of these parameters considering therapy response. METHODS: Fifteen patients with lymph node metastases of histologically confirmed locally advanced HNSCC were examined using diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) before a nonsurgical organ preserving therapy. DWI imaging was performed at 3T using eight different b-values ranging from 0 to 800s/mm(2). Using the IVIM-approach, the perfusion fraction f and the diffusion coefficient D were extracted using a biexponential fit. A follow-up period of 13.5 months was available for all patients. One patient with a macroscopically necrotic lymph node was excluded from analyses. A region of interest (ROI)-analysis was performed in all patients. RESULTS: Locoregional failure (LRF) was present in 3 of 15 patients within 13.5 months follow-up. The initial f-value was significantly higher (p=0.01) in patients with LRF (14.5+/-0.6% vs. 7.7+/-2.6%) compared to patients with locoregional control (LRC). The initial diffusion coefficient D did not differ significantly (p=0.30) between the two groups (0.97+/-0.15x10(-3)mm(2)/s vs. 0.88+/-0.13x10(-3)mm(2)/s). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that a high initial perfusion fraction f in lymph nodes may predict poor treatment response in patients with HNSCC due to locoregional failure.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>83 (5), 783-787</Feld596><PubVol>83</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>783</StrtPage><EndPage>787</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hauser T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Essig M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Jensen A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Laun FB" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Muenter M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Maier-Hein KH" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Stieltjes B" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24631600</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.ejrad.2014.02.013</DOI><KST>E010</KST><KST>E020</KST><KST>E011</KST><KST>E132</KST><KEYWORD>TUMORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PERFUSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONTRAST-ENHANCED MRI</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SQUAMOUS-CELL CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OXYGENATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49549</publishedID><Artikel>Guanine nucleotide-binding protein alpha subunit hypofunction in children with short stature and disproportionate shortening of the 4th and 5th metacarpals</Artikel><Journal>Hormone Research in Paediatrics</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: GNAS encodes the alpha subunit of the stimulatory G protein (Gsalpha). Maternal inherited Gsalpha mutations cause pseudohypoparathyroidism type Ia (PHP-Ia), associated with shortening of the 4th and 5th metacarpals. AIMS: Here we investigated the Gsalpha pathway in short patients with distinct shortening of the 4th and 5th metacarpals. METHODS: In 571 children with short stature and 4 patients with PHP-Ia metacarpal bone lengths were measured. In identified patients we analysed the Gsalpha protein function in platelets, performed GNAS sequencing, and epigenetic analysis of four significant differentially methylated regions. RESULTS: In 51 patients (8.9%) shortening of the 4th and 5th metacarpals was more pronounced than their height deficit. No GNAS coding mutations were identified in 20 analysed patients, except in 2 PHP-Ia patients. Gsalpha activity was reduced in all PHP-Ia patients and in 25% of the analysed patients. No significant methylation changes were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that patients with short stature and distinct metacarpal bone shortening could be part of the wide variety of PHP/PPHP, therefore it was worthwhile analysing the Gsalpha protein function and GNAS gene in these patients in order to further elucidate the phenotype and genotype of Gsalpha dysfunction.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>81 (3), 196-203</Feld596><PubVol>81</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>196</StrtPage><EndPage>203</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Inta IM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Choukair D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bender S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kneppo C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Knauer-Fischer S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Meyenburg K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Ivandic B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Pfister SM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Bettendorf M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24481334</PMID><DOI>10.1159/000356928</DOI><KST>B062</KST><KEYWORD>HORMONE-RELEASING-HORMONE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TURNER-SYNDROME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>resistance</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>transcription</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PSEUDOHYPOPARATHYROIDISM TYPE IB</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALBRIGHTS HEREDITARY OSTEODYSTROPHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GS-ALPHA GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PSEUDO-HYPOPARATHYROIDISM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GNAS1 GENE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49550</publishedID><Artikel>TERT promoter hotspot mutations are recurrent in myxoid liposarcomas but rare in other soft tissue sarcoma entities</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Experimental and Clinical Cancer Research</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Recently, recurrent point mutations in the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter region have been found in many human cancers, leading to a new transcription factor binding site, increased induction of TERT and subsequently to telomere maintenance. We determined the prevalence of TERT promoter mutations in soft tissue sarcomas of 341 patients comprising 16 entities and in 16 sarcoma cell lines covering 7 different soft tissue sarcoma types. METHODS: The sarcoma tissue samples were collected from the archives of the Institute of Pathology, University of Heidelberg and were composed of 39 myxoid liposarcomas (MLS), 61 dedifferentiated liposarcomas, 15 pleomorphic liposarcomas, 27 leiomyosarcomas, 25 synovial sarcomas (SS), 35 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST), 40 undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas, 17 myxofibrosarcomas, 9 low grade fibromyxoid sarcomas, 10 cases of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, 31 solitary fibrous tumors (SFT), 8 extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas, 9 angiosarcomas, 6 alveolar soft part sarcomas, 5 clear cell sarcomas and 4 epithelioid sarcomas. Sarcoma cell lines were obtained from the raising laboratories. A 193 bp fragment of the TERT promoter region covering the hot-spot mutations C228T and C250T was amplified, and direct sequencing of the PCR products was performed. RESULTS: TERT promoter mutations were detected in 36/341 sarcomas. They were highly recurrent in MLS (29/39; 74%) and were in the present MLS series not associated with the phenotype (myxoid vs. round cell variant), tumor grade, tumor site and patients' median age or gender. In the remaining cases, TERT promoter mutations were found only in 7/302 sarcoma samples and confined to SFTs (4/31; 13%), MPNSTs (2/35; 6%), and SSs (1/25; 4%). Within the collection of sarcoma cell lines examined, TERT promoter mutations were detected in two MLS and in one of three MPNST cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: TERT promoter mutations are frequent in MLSs including their round cell variants, representing the most prevalent mutation identified in this sarcoma entity to date, and in a minor fraction of SFTs, MPNSTs and SSs. The majority of sarcomas are devoid of TERT promoter hotspot mutations.

As measurement errors in self-reported whole-grain intake assessments can be substantial, dietary biomarkers are relevant to be used as complementary tools for dietary intake assessment. Alkylresorcinols (AR) are phenolic lipids found almost exclusively in whole-grain wheat and rye products among the commonly consumed foods and are considered as valid biomarkers of the intake of these products. In the present study, we analysed the plasma concentrations of five AR homologues in 2845 participants from ten European countries from a nested case-control study in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition. High concentrations of plasma total AR were found in participants from Scandinavia and Central Europe and lower concentrations in those from the Mediterranean countries. The geometric mean plasma total AR concentrations were between 35 and 41 nmol/l in samples drawn from fasting participants in the Central European and Scandinavian countries and below 23 nmol/l in those of participants from the Mediterranean countries. The whole-grain source (wheat or rye) could be determined using the ratio of two of the homologues. The main source was wheat in Greece, Italy, the Netherlands and the UK, whereas rye was also consumed in considerable amounts in Germany, Denmark and Sweden. The present study demonstrates a considerable variation in the plasma concentrations of total AR and concentrations of AR homologues across ten European countries, reflecting both quantitative and qualitative differences in the intake of whole-grain wheat and rye.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>111 (10), 1881-1890</Feld596><PubVol>111</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>1881</StrtPage><EndPage>1890</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kyro C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Olsen A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Skeie G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Loft S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Aman P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Leenders M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Dik VK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Siersema PD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Pischon T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Christensen J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Boutron-Ruault MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Fagherazzi G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Cottet V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Kuhn T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Chang-Claude J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="17" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Naska A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Oikonomidou D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Masala G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Pala V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Vineis P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Mattiello A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Peeters PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Bakken T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Asli LA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Sanchez S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Jakszyn P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Sanchez MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Amiano P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Huerta JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Barricarte A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Ljuslinder I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Palmqvist R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Wareham N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Key TJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Travis RC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Slimani N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Freisling H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="44" name="Ferrari P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="45" name="Gunter MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="46" name="Murphy N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="47" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="48" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="49" name="Landberg R" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24521535</PMID><DOI>10.1017/S0007114513004388</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>dietary fiber</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADULTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PRODUCTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SWEDEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REPRODUCIBILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHROMATOGRAPHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTERVENTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMPONENTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISEASE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49552</publishedID><Artikel>Dietary intake of acrylamide and esophageal cancer risk in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Causes and Control</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: The relation between dietary acrylamide intake and esophageal cancer (EC) risk, including esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), has not been consistent. We evaluated the association between dietary acrylamide intake and EAC, ESCC, and overall EC in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort. METHODS: Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the HR and 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI). Since nonlinear relations were observed, HRs were displayed for quartiles of acrylamide intake in mug per day. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 11 years, 341 EC were identified, 142 of which were EAC, 176 ESCC, and 23 other histological types or not specified. An increase in EC risk was observed in the second and third quartiles (HRQ2vsQ1 1.75, 95 % CI 1.12-2.74; HRQ3vsQ1 1.66, 95 % CI 1.05-2.61), but not in the fourth quartile, and there was no evidence for a linear dose-response trend. HRs were similarly elevated but not statistically significant when ESCC and EAC were analyzed separately, due to the small number of cases observed. No associations were observed when quartiles were based on energy-adjusted acrylamide intake. CONCLUSIONS: In the EPIC cohort, an association between estimated dietary acrylamide intake and an increased risk of developing EC was observed in the middle quartiles but not in the highest quartile; however, results from other larger cohorts or consortia, and results from biomarker studies, might add to the evidence provided by this analysis, suggesting that acrylamide is not an important risk factor for EC.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>25 (5), 639-646</Feld596><PubVol>25</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>639</StrtPage><EndPage>646</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Lujan-Barroso L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Gonzalez CA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Slimani N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Obon-Santacana M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Ferrari P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Freisling H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Clavel-Chapelon F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Boutron-Ruault MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Racine A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Katzke V" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Kuehn T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Olsen A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Quiros JR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Sanchez-Cantalejo E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Amiano P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Navarro C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Barricarte A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Wareham N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Travis RC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Bamia C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Benetou V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Saieva C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Grioni S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Vineis P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Mattiello A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Siersema PD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Numans ME" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Peeters PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Ericson U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Wirfalt E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Sund M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Johansson M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Skeie G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Duell EJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24532026</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s10552-014-0359-5</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>adenocarcinoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>meat</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>UPPER AERODIGESTIVE TRACT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METAANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEME IRON INTAKE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49553</publishedID><Artikel>Nuclear translocation and regulation of intranuclear distribution of cytoplasmic poly(a)-binding protein are distinct processes mediated by two epstein barr virus proteins</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>Many viruses target cytoplasmic polyA binding protein (PABPC) to effect widespread inhibition of host gene expression, a process termed viral host-shutoff (vhs). During lytic replication of Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) we observed that PABPC was efficiently translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Translocated PABPC was diffusely distributed but was excluded from viral replication compartments. Vhs during EBV infection is regulated by the viral alkaline nuclease, BGLF5. Transfection of BGLF5 alone into BGLF5-KO cells or uninfected 293 cells promoted translocation of PAPBC that was distributed in clumps in the nucleus. ZEBRA, a viral bZIP protein, performs essential functions in the lytic program of EBV, including activation or repression of downstream viral genes. ZEBRA is also an essential replication protein that binds to viral oriLyt and interacts with other viral replication proteins. We report that ZEBRA also functions as a regulator of vhs. ZEBRA translocated PABPC to the nucleus, controlled the intranuclear distribution of PABPC, and caused global shutoff of host gene expression. Transfection of ZEBRA alone into 293 cells caused nuclear translocation of PABPC in the majority of cells in which ZEBRA was expressed. Co-transfection of ZEBRA with BGLF5 into BGLF5-KO cells or uninfected 293 cells rescued the diffuse intranuclear pattern of PABPC seen during lytic replication. ZEBRA mutants defective for DNA-binding were capable of regulating the intranuclear distribution of PABPC, and caused PABPC to co-localize with ZEBRA. One ZEBRA mutant, Z(S186E), was deficient in translocation yet was capable of altering the intranuclear distribution of PABPC. Therefore ZEBRA-mediated nuclear translocation of PABPC and regulation of intranuclear PABPC distribution are distinct events. Using a click chemistry-based assay for new protein synthesis, we show that ZEBRA and BGLF5 each function as viral host shutoff factors.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (4), e92593-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>e92593</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Park R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="El-Guindy A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Heston L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Lin SF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Yu KP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Nagy M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Borah S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Delecluse HJ" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Steitz J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Miller G" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24705134</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0092593</DOI><KST>F100</KST><KEYWORD>POLY(A) BINDING-PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ZEBRA PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BURKITTS-LYMPHOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REPLICATION COMPARTMENTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HOST SHUTOFF</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HERPES-SIMPLEX-VIRUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA-REPLICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MESSENGER-RNA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49554</publishedID><Artikel>Pleiotropic associations of risk variants identified for other cancers with lung cancer risk: the PAGE and TRICL consortia</Artikel><Journal>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies have identified hundreds of genetic variants associated with specific cancers. A few of these risk regions have been associated with more than one cancer site; however, a systematic evaluation of the associations between risk variants for other cancers and lung cancer risk has yet to be performed. METHODS: We included 18023 patients with lung cancer and 60543 control subjects from two consortia, Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) and Transdisciplinary Research in Cancer of the Lung (TRICL). We examined 165 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were previously associated with at least one of 16 non-lung cancer sites. Study-specific logistic regression results underwent meta-analysis, and associations were also examined by race/ethnicity, histological cell type, sex, and smoking status. A Bonferroni-corrected P value of 2.5x10(-5) was used to assign statistical significance. RESULTS: The breast cancer SNP LSP1 rs3817198 was associated with an increased risk of lung cancer (odds ratio [OR] = 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05 to 1.14; P = 2.8x10(-6)). This association was strongest for women with adenocarcinoma (P = 1.2x10(-4)) and not statistically significant in men (P = .14) with this cell type (P het by sex = .10). Two glioma risk variants, TERT rs2853676 and CDKN2BAS1 rs4977756, which are located in regions previously associated with lung cancer, were associated with increased risk of adenocarcinoma (OR = 1.16; 95% CI = 1.10 to 1.22; P = 1.1x10(-8)) and squamous cell carcinoma (OR = 1.13; CI = 1.07 to 1.19; P = 2.5x10(-5)), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate a novel pleiotropic association between the breast cancer LSP1 risk region marked by variant rs3817198 and lung cancer risk.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>106 (4), dju061-</Feld596><PubVol>106</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>dju061</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Park SL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Fesinmeyer MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Timofeeva M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Caberto CP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kocarnik JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Han Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Love SA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Young A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Dumitrescu L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Lin Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Goodloe R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Wilkens LR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Hindorff L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Fowke JH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Carty C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Buyske S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Schumacher FR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Butler A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Dilks H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Deelman E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Cote ML" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Chen W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Pande M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Christiani DC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Field JK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Bickebller H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Risch A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="27" name="Heinrich J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Brennan P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Wang Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Eisen T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Houlston RS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Thun M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Albanes D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Caporaso N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Peters U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="North KE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Heiss G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Crawford DC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Bush WS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Haiman CA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Landi MT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Hung RJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Kooperberg C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="44" name="Amos CI" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="45" name="Le Marchand L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="46" name="Cheng I" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24681604</PMID><DOI>10.1093/jnci/dju061</DOI><KST>C010</KST><KEYWORD>POPULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>adenocarcinoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BREAST-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>susceptibility loci</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOTYPE DATA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METAANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AGGREGATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLIOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMMON GENETIC-VARIATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49556</publishedID><Artikel>Attractive interactions among intermediate filaments determine network mechanics in vitro</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>Mechanical and structural properties of K8/K18 and vimentin intermediate filament (IF) networks have been investigated using bulk mechanical rheometry and optical microrheology including diffusing wave spectroscopy and multiple particle tracking. A high elastic modulus G0 at low protein concentration c, a weak concentration dependency of G0 (G0 approximately c(0.5 +/- 0.1)) and pronounced strain stiffening are found for these systems even without external crossbridgers. Strong attractive interactions among filaments are required to maintain these characteristic mechanical features, which have also been reported for various other IF networks. Filament assembly, the persistence length of the filaments and the network mesh size remain essentially unaffected when a nonionic surfactant is added, but strain stiffening is completely suppressed, G0 drops by orders of magnitude and exhibits a scaling G0 approximately c(1.9 +/- 0.2) in agreement with microrheological measurements and as expected for entangled networks of semi-flexible polymers. Tailless K8Delta/K18DeltaT and various other tailless filament networks do not exhibit strain stiffening, but still show high G0 values. Therefore, two binding sites are proposed to exist in IF networks. A weaker one mediated by hydrophobic amino acid clusters in the central rod prevents stretched filaments between adjacent cross-links from thermal equilibration and thus provides the high G0 values. Another strong one facilitating strain stiffening is located in the tail domain with its high fraction of hydrophobic amino acid sequences. Strain stiffening is less pronounced for vimentin than for K8/K18 due to electrostatic repulsion forces partly compensating the strong attraction at filament contact points.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (4), e93194-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>e93194</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Pawelzyk P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Muecke N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Herrmann H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Willenbacher N" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24690778</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0093194</DOI><KST>B040</KST><KST>B065</KST><KEYWORD>MODULUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>keratins</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TAIL DOMAIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>F-ACTIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ELASTICITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VISCOELASTIC PROPERTIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Nanomechanics</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BIOPOLYMER NETWORKS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIN SOLUTIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMPLEX FLUIDS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49557</publishedID><Artikel>DNA mismatch repair gene MSH6 implicated in determining age at natural menopause</Artikel><Journal>Human Molecular Genetics</Journal><ABSTr>The length of female reproductive lifespan is associated with multiple adverse outcomes, including breast cancer, cardiovascular disease and infertility. The biological processes that govern the timing of the beginning and end of reproductive life are not well understood. Genetic variants are known to contribute to 50 of the variation in both age at menarche and menopause, but to date the known genes explain 15 of the genetic component. We have used genome-wide association in a bivariate meta-analysis of both traits to identify genes involved in determining reproductive lifespan. We observed significant genetic correlation between the two traits using genome-wide complex trait analysis. However, we found no robust statistical evidence for individual variants with an effect on both traits. A novel association with age at menopause was detected for a variant rs1800932 in the mismatch repair gene MSH6 (P 1.9 10(9)), which was also associated with altered expression levels of MSH6 mRNA in multiple tissues. This study contributes to the growing evidence that DNA repair processes play a key role in ovarian ageing and could be an important therapeutic target for infertility.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (9), 2490-2497</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>2490</StrtPage><EndPage>2497</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Perry,J.R.B."

Methods: 376 patients were included who underwent eMRI for staging before radical open prostatectomy at 1.5 T with an endorectal coil. Statistical accuracy for detection of SVI was calculated. MR images of patients with SVI were further evaluated by two radiologists according to the classification by Wheeler and Ohori. Results: In the cohort, 35 patients had SVI after histopathological evaluation of the prostatectomy specimen (stage pT3b). Sensitivity and specificity for detection of SVI were 48.6 and 97.7%, respectively. Negative and positive predictive values and overall accuracy were 94.9, 68.0, and 93.1%, respectively. Infiltration pattern analysis showed that type I invasion was most common with 48.6 followed by type IIa (31.4%) and IIb (20%). Type III was not present. There was no statistical significant difference between the three groups regarding Gleason score, age, and prostate-specific antigen level. Conclusions: eMRI with high-spatial resolution T2-weighted imaging is accurate for assessment of SVI. Depiction of different infiltration types of SVI is feasible. By adding information about the extent of SVI, diagnostic reporting and risk stratification could be improved. (c) 2013 S.

Even in the 15% of patients who are eligible for surgical resection the outlook is dismal with less than 10% of patients surviving after 5 years. Allogeneic hematopoietic (allo-HSCT) stem cell transplantation is an established treatment capable of to providing cure in a variety of hematopoietic malignancies. Best results are achieved when the underlying neoplasm has been turned into a stage of minimal disease by chemotherapy. Allo-HSCT in advanced solid tumors including pancreatic cancer have been of limited success, however studies of allo-HSCT in solid tumors in minimal disease situations have never been performed. The aim of this trial is to provide evidence for the clinical value of allo-HSCT in pancreatic cancer put into a minimal disease status by effective surgical resection and standard adjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS/DESIGN: The STEM PACE trial is a single center, phase II study to evaluate adjuvant allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in pancreatic cancer after surgical resection. The study will evaluate as primary endpoint 2 year progression free survival and will generate first time state-of-the-art scientific clinical evidence if allo-HSCT is feasible and if it can provide long term disease control in patients with effectively resected pancreatic cancer. Screened eligible patients after surgical resection and standard adjuvant chemotherapy with HLA matched related stem cell donor can participate. Patients without a matched donor will be used as a historical control. Study patients will undergo standard conditioning for allo-HSCT followed by transplantation of allogeneic unmanipulated peripheral blood stem cells. The follow up of the patients will continue for 2 years. Secondary endpoints will be evaluated on 7 postintervention visits. DISCUSSION: The principal question addressed in this trial is whether allo-HSCT can change the unfavourable natural course of this disease. The underlying hypothesis is that allo-HSCT has the capacity to provide long-term disease control to an extent otherwise not possible in pancreatic cancer, thereby substantially improving survival of affected patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial has been registered: ISRCTN47877138.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>14 (), Art. Nr.: 168-</Feld596><PubVol>14</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>Art.

The anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) causes regression of Mullerian structures during fetal development in males and has been shown to inhibit the growth of epithelial ovarian cancer. Therefore, we hypothesized that pre-diagnostic serum concentrations of AMH are inversely associated with risk of invasive serous ovarian cancer. METHODS: A case-control study (107 cases, 208 controls) was nested within the population-based Finnish Maternity Cohort (1986-2007). The sample donated during the first trimester of the last pregnancy preceding cancer diagnosis of the case subjects was selected for the study. For each case, two controls, matched on age and date at sampling, as well as parity at sampling and at cancer diagnosis were selected. AMH was measured by a second-generation AMH ELISA. Conditional logistic regression was used to compute odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for invasive serous ovarian cancer associated with AMH concentrations. RESULTS: Overall AMH concentrations were not associated with risk of invasive serous ovarian cancer (OR 0.93; 95 % CI 0.49-1.77 for top vs. bottom tertile, P trend=0.83). In women older than the median age at sampling (32.7 years), a doubling of AMH was associated with decreased risk (OR 0.69; 95 % CI 0.49-0.96), whereas an increased risk (OR 1.64; 95 % CI 1.06-2.54) was observed in younger women, P homogeneity = 0.002. CONCLUSIONS: In this first prospective investigation, risk of invasive serous ovarian cancer was not associated with pre-diagnostic AMH concentrations overall; however, the association may depend on age at AMH measurement.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>25 (5), 583-589</Feld596><PubVol>25</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>583</StrtPage><EndPage>589</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schock H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Lundin E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Vaarasmaki M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Grankvist K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Fry A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Dorgan JF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Pukkala E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Lehtinen M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Surcel HM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Lukanova A" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24562905</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s10552-014-0363-9</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>CELL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CYCLE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POPULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WOMEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NORMAL SERUM CONCENTRATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INHIBITING SUBSTANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANTIMULLERIAN HORMONE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRIMESTER</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49563</publishedID><Artikel>Hunting complex differential gene interaction patterns across molecular contexts</Artikel><Journal>Nucleic Acids Research</Journal><ABSTr>Heterogeneity in genetic networks across different signaling molecular contexts can suggest molecular regulatory mechanisms. Here we describe a comparative chi-square analysis (CPchi(2)) method, considerably more flexible and effective than other alternatives, to screen large gene expression data sets for conserved and differential interactions. CPchi(2) decomposes interactions across conditions to assess homogeneity and heterogeneity. Theoretically, we prove an asymptotic chi-square null distribution for the interaction heterogeneity statistic. Empirically, on synthetic yeast cell cycle data, CPchi(2) achieved much higher statistical power in detecting differential networks than alternative approaches. We applied CPchi(2) to Drosophila melanogaster wing gene expression arrays collected under normal conditions, and conditions with overexpressed E2F and Cabut, two transcription factor complexes that promote ectopic cell cycling. The resulting differential networks suggest a mechanism by which E2F and Cabut regulate distinct gene interactions, while still sharing a small core network. Thus, CPchi(2) is sensitive in detecting network rewiring, useful in comparing related biological systems.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>42 (7), e57-</Feld596><PubVol>42</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>e57</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Song M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Zhang Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Katzaroff AJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Edgar BA" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Buttitta L" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24482443</PMID><DOI>10.1093/nar/gku086</DOI><KST>A220</KST><KEYWORD>INDUCIBLE EARLY GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FACTOR FAMILY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TIEG</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Drosophila</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>proliferation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NETWORK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL-GROWTH</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49564</publishedID><Artikel>Gene silencing associated with SWI/SNF complex loss during NSCLC development</Artikel><Journal>Molecular Cancer Research</Journal><ABSTr>The SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex regulates gene expression and alters chromatin structures in an ATP-dependent manner. Recent sequencing efforts have shown mutations in BRG1 (SMARCA4), one of two mutually exclusive ATPase subunits in the complex, in a significant number of human lung tumor cell lines and primary non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) clinical specimens. To determine how BRG1 loss fuels tumor progression in NSCLC, molecular profiling was performed after restoration of BRG1 expression or treatment with a histone deacetylase inhibitor or a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitor in a BRG1-deficient NSCLC cells. Importantly, validation studies from multiple cell lines revealed that BRG1 reexpression led to substantial changes in the expression of CDH1, CDH3, EHF, and RRAD that commonly undergo silencing by other epigenetic mechanisms during NSCLC development. Furthermore, treatment with DNMT inhibitors did not restore expression of these transcripts, indicating that this common mechanism of gene silencing did not account for their loss of expression. Collectively, BRG1 loss is an important mechanism for the epigenetic silencing of target genes during NSCLC development. IMPLICATIONS: Inactivation of the SWI/SNF complex provides a novel mechanism to induce gene silencing during NSCLC development.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>12 (4), 560-70</Feld596><PubVol>12</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>560</StrtPage><EndPage>70</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Song S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Walter V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Karaca M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Li Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Bartlett CS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Smiraglia DJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Serber D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Sproul CD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Plass C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Zhang J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Hayes DN" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Zheng Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Weissman BE" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24445599</PMID><DOI>10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-13-0427</DOI><KST>C010</KST><KEYWORD>GROWTH ARREST</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RETINOBLASTOMA PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL-CYCLE ARREST</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NUCLEAR RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LUNG-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DOWN-REGULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA methylation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROSTATE-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHROMATIN-REMODELING FACTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CD44 EXPRESSION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49565</publishedID><Artikel>Evaluating the performance of clinical criteria for predicting mismatch repair gene mutations in Lynch syndrome: a comprehensive analysis of 3,671 families.</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Carriers of mismatch repair (MMR) gene mutations have a high lifetime risk for colorectal and endometrial cancers, as well as other malignancies. As mutation analysis to detect these patients is expensive and time-consuming, clinical criteria and tumor-tissue analysis are widely used as pre-screening methods. The aim of our study was to evaluate the performance of commonly applied clinical criteria (the Amsterdam I and II Criteria, and the original and revised Bethesda Guidelines) and the results of tumor-tissue analysis in predicting MMR gene mutations. We analyzed 3,671 families from the German HNPCC Registry and divided them into nine mutually exclusive groups with different clinical criteria. A total of 680 families (18.5%) were found to have a pathogenic MMR gene mutation. Among all 1,284 families with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) colorectal cancer, the overall mutation detection rate was 53.0%. Mutation frequencies and their distribution between the four MMR genes differed significantly between clinical groups (p &lt; 0.001). The highest frequencies were found in families fulfilling the Amsterdam Criteria (46.4%). Families with loss of MSH2 expression had higher mutation detection rates (69.5%) than families with loss of MLH1 expression (43.1%). MMR mutations were found significantly more often in families with at least one MSI-H small-bowel cancer (p &lt; 0.001). No MMR mutations were found among patients under 40-years-old with only colorectal adenoma. Familial clustering of Lynch syndrome-related tumors, early age of onset, and familial occurrence of small-bowel cancer were clinically relevant predictors for Lynch syndrome.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>135 (1), 69-77</Feld596><PubVol>135</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>69</StrtPage><EndPage>77</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Steinke V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Holzapfel S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Loeffler M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Holinski-Feder E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Morak M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Schackert HK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Gorgens H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Pox C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Royer-Pokora B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="von Knebel-Doeberitz M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Buttner R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Propping P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Engel C" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24493211</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28650</DOI><KST>G105</KST><KEYWORD>REVISED BETHESDA GUIDELINES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NONPOLYPOSIS COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CARRIERS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>microsatellite instability</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IDENTIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>immunohistochemistry</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIAGNOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MLH1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MSH2</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HNPCC</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49566</publishedID><Artikel>The influence of dicoumarol on the bioactivation of the carcinogen aristolochic acid I in rats</Artikel><Journal>Mutagenesis</Journal><ABSTr>Aristolochic acid I (AAI) is the major toxic component of the plant extract AA, which leads to the development of nephropathy and urothelial cancer in human. Individual susceptibility to AAI-induced disease might reflect variability in enzymes that metabolise AAI. In vitro NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1) is the most potent enzyme that activates AAI by catalyzing formation of AAI-DNA adducts, which are found in kidneys of patients exposed to AAI. Inhibition of renal NQO1 activity by dicoumarol has been shown in mice. Here, we studied the influence of dicoumarol on metabolic activation of AAI in Wistar rats in vivo. In contrast to previous in vitro findings, dicoumarol did not inhibit AAI-DNA adduct formation in rats. Compared with rats treated with AAI alone, 11- and 5.4-fold higher AAI-DNA adduct levels were detected in liver and kidney, respectively, of rats pretreated with dicoumarol prior to exposure to AAI. Cytosols and microsomes isolated from liver and kidney of these rats were analysed for activity and protein levels of enzymes known to be involved in AAI metabolism. The combination of dicoumarol with AAI induced NQO1 protein level and activity in both organs. This was paralleled by an increase in AAI-DNA adduct levels found in ex vivo incubations with cytosols from rats pretreated with dicoumarol compared to cytosols from untreated rats. Microsomal ex vivo incubations showed a lower AAI detoxication to its oxidative metabolite, 8-hydroxyaristolochic acid (AAIa), although cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A was practically unchanged. Because of these unexpected results, we examined CYP2C activity in microsomes and found that treatment of rats with dicoumarol alone and in combination with AAI inhibited CYP2C6/11 in liver. Therefore, these results indicate that CYP2C enzymes might contribute to AAI detoxication.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>29 (3), 189-200</Feld596><PubVol>29</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>189</StrtPage><EndPage>200</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Stiborova M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Levova K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Barta F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Sulc M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Frei E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Arlt VM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Schmeiser HH" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24598128</PMID><DOI>10.1093/mutage/geu004</DOI><KST>E030</KST><KST>C016</KST><KST>G110</KST><KEYWORD>urothelial cancer</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BALKAN ENDEMIC NEPHROPATHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>detoxication</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK-FACTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ARISTOLACTAM-DNA ADDUCTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIVER-MICROSOMES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CYTOCHROMES P450 1A1/2</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VITAMIN-K METABOLISM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NAD(P)H/QUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49567</publishedID><Artikel>CTLA-4 Is Expressed by Activated Mouse NK Cells and Inhibits NK Cell IFN-gamma Production in Response to Mature Dendritic Cells</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Immunology</Journal><ABSTr>NK cells express an array of activating and inhibitory receptors that determine NK cell responses upon triggering by cognate ligands. Although activating NK cell receptors recognize mainly ligands expressed by stressed, virus-infected, or transformed cells, most inhibitory receptors engage MHC class I, preventing NK cell activation in response to healthy cells. In this study, we provide insight into the regulation and function of additional receptors involved in mouse NK cell responses: CTLA-4 and CD28. CTLA-4 and CD28 engage the same ligands, B7-1 and B7-2, which are primarily expressed by APCs, such as dendritic cells. Our data demonstrate that activation of mouse NK cells with IL-2 induces the expression of CTLA-4 and upregulates CD28. CTLA-4 expression in IL-2-expanded NK cells was further up- or downregulated by IL-12 or TGF-beta, respectively. Using gene-deficient NK cells, we show that CD28 induces, and CTLA-4 inhibits, IFN-gamma release by NK cells upon engagement by the recombinant ligand, B7-1, or upon coculture with mature dendritic cells. Notably, we show that mouse NK cells infiltrating solid tumors express CD28 and CTLA-4 and respond to stimulation with recombinant B7-1, suggesting that the NK cell responses mediated by the CD28/CTLA-4:B7-1/B7-2 system could be of importance during malignant disease. Accordingly, our study might have implications for immunotherapy of cancer based on blocking anti-CTLA-4 mAbs.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>192 (9), 4184-4191</Feld596><PubVol>192</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>4184</StrtPage><EndPage>4191</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Stojanovic A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Fiegler N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Brunner-Weinzierl M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Cerwenka A" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24688023</PMID><DOI>10.4049/jimmunol.1302091</DOI><KST>D080</KST><KEYWORD>MULTIORGAN TISSUE DESTRUCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANTIGEN 4 CTLA-4</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMBINATION IMMUNOTHERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CUTTING EDGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>T-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NATURAL-KILLER-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTERFERON-GAMMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COSTIMULATORY MOLECULES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CLASS-I MOLECULES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TGF-BETA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49568</publishedID><Artikel>PRAS40 prevents development of diabetic cardiomyopathy and improves hepatic insulin sensitivity in obesity</Artikel><Journal>EMBO Molecular Medicine</Journal><ABSTr>Diabetes is a multi-organ disease and diabetic cardiomyopathy can result in heart failure, which is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. In the liver, insulin resistance contributes to hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia, which further worsens the metabolic profile. Defects in mTOR signalling are believed to contribute to metabolic dysfunctions in diabetic liver and hearts, but evidence is missing that mTOR activation is causal to the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. This study shows that specific mTORC1 inhibition by PRAS40 prevents the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. This phenotype was associated with improved metabolic function, blunted hypertrophic growth and preserved cardiac function. In addition PRAS40 treatment improves hepatic insulin sensitivity and reduces systemic hyperglycaemia in obese mice. Thus, unlike rapamycin, mTORC1 inhibition with PRAS40 improves metabolic profile in diabetic mice. These findings may open novel avenues for therapeutic strategies using PRAS40 directed against diabetic-related diseases.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>6 (1), 57-65</Feld596><PubVol>6</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>57</StrtPage><EndPage>65</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Volkers M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Doroudgar S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Nguyen N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Konstandin MH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Quijada P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Din S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Ornelas L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Thuerauf DJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Gude N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Friedrich K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Herzig S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Glembotski CC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Sussman MA" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24408966</PMID><DOI>10.1002/emmm.201303183</DOI><KST>A170</KST><KEYWORD>MAMMALIAN TARGET</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RAPAMYCIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DOWNSTREAM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEART</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIFFERENTIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METABOLISM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHWAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RICH AKT SUBSTRATE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49569</publishedID><Artikel>Simultaneous assessment of airway instability and respiratory dynamics with low-dose 4D-CT in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a technical note</Artikel><Journal>Respiration</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Advanced-stage chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with severely altered respiratory dynamics. Dynamic airway instability is usually diagnosed by invasive bronchoscopy. Cine-computed tomography (CT) may be used alternatively, but is limited to predefined anatomical positions. Also, a paradoxical diaphragmatic motion has been described in patients with emphysema. OBJECTIVES: As the airways and chest wall show inherently high contrast to airway lumen and lung tissue, low-dose CT acquisitions potentially suffice for depicting tracheobronchial and chest wall motion. Therefore, we propose low-dose dynamic respiratory-gated multidetector CT (4D-CT) of the whole chest as a new method to assess respiratory dynamics. METHODS: 4D-CT was performed in 3 patients (52, 62 and 76 years old) with suspected tracheal instability due to COPD or tracheal stenosis at minimal pitch (0.09) and radiation exposure (1.4-1.9 mSv) during regular tidal breathing registered by a belt system. Image reconstruction involved a raw data-based iterative algorithm (1.5-mm slice thickness, 1.0-mm z-axis increment, 5% respiratory increment), resulting in a stack of 6,700 images, which were evaluated with a 4D-viewing tool. Results: An excessive dynamic collapse of the trachea in combination with tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) of the main-stem and segmental bronchi, and a paradoxical diaphragmatic motion were demonstrated in 1 case. Moreover, we detected a saber-sheath trachea and main-stem TBM in another case. The third case showed a fixed tracheal stenosis. CONCLUSIONS: 4D-CT provides unprecedented z-axis coverage and time-resolved volumetric datasets of the whole chest. Airway instability, stenosis and paradoxical diaphragmatic motion may be assessed simultaneously, preceding interventions such as airway stabilization or lung volume reduction.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>87 (4), 294-300</Feld596><PubVol>87</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>294</StrtPage><EndPage>300</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Wielpuetz MO" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Eberhardt R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Puderbach M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Weinheimer O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kauczor HU" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Heussel CP" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24557362</PMID><DOI>10.1159/000357448</DOI><KST>E010</KST><KEYWORD>TRACHEOBRONCHOMALACIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EMPHYSEMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIAGNOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MRI</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COPD</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLLAPSE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MANAGEMENT</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49570</publishedID><Artikel>Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of prostate cancer with a gastrin releasing peptide receptor antagonist--from mice to men</Artikel><Journal>Theranostics</Journal><ABSTr>Ex vivo studies have shown that the gastrin releasing peptide receptor (GRPr) is overexpressed on almost all primary prostate cancers, making it a promising target for prostate cancer imaging and targeted radiotherapy. METHODS: Biodistribution, dosimetry and tumor uptake of the GRPr antagonist (6)(4)Cu-CB-TE2A-AR06 [((6)(4)Cu-4,11-bis(carboxymethyl)-1,4,8,11-tetraazabicyclo(6.6.2)hexadecane)-PEG (4)-D-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-LeuNH(2)] were studied by PET/CT in four patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer (T1c-T2b, Gleason 6-7). RESULTS: No adverse events were observed after injection of (6)(4)Cu-CB-TE2A-AR06. Three of four tumors were visualized with high contrast [tumor-to-prostate ratio &gt; 4 at 4 hours (h) post injection (p.i.)], one small tumor (T1c, &lt; 5% tumor on biopsy specimens) showed moderate contrast (tumor-to-prostate ratio at 4 h: 1.9). Radioactivity was cleared by the kidneys and only the pancreas demonstrated significant accumulation of radioactivity, which rapidly decreased over time. CONCLUSION: (6)(4)Cu-CB-TE2A-AR06 shows very favorable characteristics for imaging prostate cancer. Future studies evaluating (6)(4)Cu-CB-TE2A-AR06 PET/CT for prostate cancer detection, staging, active surveillance, and radiation treatment planning are necessary.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>4 (4), 412-419</Feld596><PubVol>4</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>412</StrtPage><EndPage>419</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Wieser G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Mansi R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Grosu AL" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schultze-Seemann W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Dumont-Walter RA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Meyer PT" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Maecke HR" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Reubi JC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Weber WA" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24578724</PMID><DOI>10.7150/thno.7324</DOI><KST>L601</KST><KEYWORD>bombesin analog</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BIODISTRIBUTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MALIGNANCIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACID</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RADIATION-DOSIMETRY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49575</publishedID><Artikel>Blood autoantibodies against tumor-associated antigens as biomarkers in early detection of colorectal cancer</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Letters</Journal><ABSTr>Multiple studies have shown that cancer patients produce detectable autoantibodies against certain tumor-associated antigens, which might be promising blood biomarkers for early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC). We aimed to provide an overview of published studies on blood autoantibody markers for early detection of CRC and to summarize their diagnostic performance. A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge and EMBASE to find relevant studies published until 23 July 2013. Relevant information, such as study population characteristics, autoantibodies studied, analytical methods and diagnostic performance characteristics was independently extracted by two reviewers. Overall, 67 studies evaluating 109 autoantibody markers were included. Most individual markers showed low sensitivity (below 25%) for detecting CRC, along with high specificity close to 100%. Occasionally reported higher sensitivities for specific antibodies are yet to be replicated in independent studies. Generally, more promising results were seen for combinations of multiple autoantibody markers. But again, these promising results are yet to be replicated in other samples. In conclusion, autoantibody signatures may become a promising approach to noninvasive CRC screening. Optimized marker panels are yet to be developed, and promising results require validation in large screening populations.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>346 (2), 178-187</Feld596><PubVol>346</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>178</StrtPage><EndPage>187</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Chen H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Werner S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Tao S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Zoernig I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24462820</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.canlet.2014.01.007</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>PROTEOMICS-BASED IDENTIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SERUM P53 ANTIBODIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CIRCULATING ANTIBODIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER/TESTIS ANTIGEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AUTOIMMUNE-RESPONSE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLON-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGNOSTIC-SIGNIFICANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANTI-P53 ANTIBODIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PANCREATIC-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMORAL IMMUNE-RESPONSE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49576</publishedID><Artikel>De- and re-differentiation of the melanocytic lineage</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Cell Biology</Journal><ABSTr>Terminally differentiated cells can be reprogrammed by the transient, ectopic overexpression of different sets of genes into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). This process not only has considerable implications for regenerative medicine but is also highly relevant to multiple stages of oncogenesis, including melanoma. In other settings, the de-differentiation of normal and tumor cells is also responsible for a phenotype switch which completely changes the cell fate. Conversely, iPSCs as well as embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can be differentiated in vitro toward specific lineages, for example melanocytes, which offer useful models to investigate the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms involved in cellular differentiation.

Understanding the molecular mechanisms behind this disease might be the key for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that post-transcriptionally control gene expression, thereby regulating various cellular signaling pathways involved in the initiation and progression of different cancer types, including melanoma. In this review, we summarize approaches for the identification of candidate miRNAs and their target genes and review the functions of miRNAs in melanoma. Finally, we highlight the recent progress in pre-clinical use of miRNAs as prognostic markers and therapeutic targets.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>93 (1-2), 11-22</Feld596><PubVol>93</PubVol><PubIss>1-2</PubIss><StrtPage>11</StrtPage><EndPage>22</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Luo C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Weber CE" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Osen W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Bosserhoff AK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Eichmueller SB" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24602414</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.ejcb.2014.02.001</DOI><KST>D015</KST><KEYWORD>DOWN-REGULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL-LINES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MALIGNANT-MELANOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION PROFILES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CIRCULATING MICRORNAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>epigenetic regulation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN LUNG CANCERS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR-SUPPRESSIVE MICRORNAS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49578</publishedID><Artikel>NoRC silences rRNA genes, telomeres, and centromeres</Artikel><Journal>Cell Cycle</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>13 (4), 493-494</Feld596><PubVol>13</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>493</StrtPage><EndPage>494</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Postepska-Igielska A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Grummt I" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24419143</PMID><DOI>10.4161/cc.27783</DOI><KST>A030</KST><KEYWORD>HETEROCHROMATIN FORMATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49714</publishedID><Artikel>Iodonium ylides for one-step, no-carrier-added radiofluorination of electron rich arenes, exemplified with 4-(([F-18] fluorophenoxy)-phenylmethyl) piperidine NET and SERT ligands</Artikel><Journal>RSC Advances</Journal><ABSTr>Iodonium ylide precursors of electron rich arenes, i. e. the NET and SERT ligands 4-(( 3- and 4-fluorophenoxy) phenylmethyl) piperidine, served as model compounds for the direct substitution with n.c.a.

Perturbations in one-carbon metabolism have been implicated in increased risk of some cancers and may also affect inflammatory processes. We investigated these interrelated pathways to understand their relation. The objective was to explore associations between inflammation and biomarkers of nutritional status and one-carbon metabolism. In a cross-sectional study in 1976 women selected from the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, plasma vitamin B-6 [pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP)], plasma vitamin B-12, plasma folate, and RBC folate were measured as nutritional biomarkers; serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) were measured as biomarkers of inflammation; and homocysteine and cysteine were measured as integrated biomarkers of one-carbon metabolism. Student's t, chi-square, and Spearman rank correlations, along with multiple linear regressions, were used to explore relations between biomarkers; additionally, we tested stratification by folic acid fortification period and multivitamin use. With the use of univariate analysis, plasma PLP was the only nutritional biomarker that was modestly significantly correlated with serum CRP and SAA (rho = -0.22 and -0.12, respectively; P &lt; 0.0001). Homocysteine (mumol/L) showed significant inverse correlations with all nutritional biomarkers (ranging from rho = -0.30 to rho = -0.46; all P &lt; 0.0001). With the use of multiple linear regression, plasma PLP, RBC folate, homocysteine, and cysteine were identified as independent predictors of CRP; and PLP, vitamin B-12, RBC folate, and homocysteine were identified as predictors of SAA. When stratified by folic acid fortification period, nutrition-homocysteine correlations were generally weaker in the postfortification period, whereas associations between plasma PLP and serum CRP increased. Biomarkers of inflammation are associated with PLP, RBC folate, and homocysteine in women. The connection between the pathways needs to be further investigated and causality established. The trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00000611.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>144 (5), 714-721</Feld596><PubVol>144</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>714</StrtPage><EndPage>721</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Abbenhardt C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Miller JW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Song X" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Brown EC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Cheng TY" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Wener MH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Zheng Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Toriola AT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Neuhouser ML" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Beresford SA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Makar KW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Bailey LB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Maneval DR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Green R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Manson JE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Van Horn L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Ulrich CM" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24647390</PMID><DOI>10.3945/jn.113.183970</DOI><KST>G110</KST><KEYWORD>ABNORMAL VITAMIN-B-6 STATUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FOLIC-ACID SUPPLEMENTATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>B STATUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PLASMA HOMOCYSTEINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA methylation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OXIDATIVE STRESS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>C-REACTIVE PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISEASE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49719</publishedID><Artikel>Adenoviruses Using the Cancer Marker EphA2 as a Receptor In Vitro and In Vivo by Genetic Ligand Insertion into Different Capsid Scaffolds</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>Adenoviral gene therapy and oncolysis would critically benefit from targeted cell entry by genetically modified capsids. This requires both the ablation of native adenovirus tropism and the identification of ligands that remain functional in virus context. Here, we establish cell type-specific entry of HAdV-5-based vectors by genetic ligand insertion into a chimeric fiber with shaft and knob domains of the short HAdV-41 fiber (Ad5T/41sSK). This fiber format was reported to ablate transduction in vitro and biodistribution to the liver in vivo. We show that the YSA peptide, binding to the pan-cancer marker EphA2, can be inserted into three positions of the chimeric fiber, resulting in strong transduction of EphA2-positive but not EphA2-negative cells of human melanoma biopsies and of tumor xenografts after intratumoral injection. Transduction was blocked by soluble YSA peptide and restored for EphA2-negative cells after recombinant EphA2 expression. The YSA peptide could also be inserted into three positions of a CAR binding-ablated HAdV-5 fiber enabling specific transduction; however, the Ad5T/41sSK format was superior in vivo. In conclusion, we establish an adenovirus capsid facilitating functional insertion of targeting peptides and a novel adenovirus using the tumor marker EphA2 as receptor with high potential for cancer gene therapy and viral oncolysis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (4), e95723-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>e95723</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Behr M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Kaufmann JK" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Ketzer P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Engelhardt S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Muck-Hausl M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Okun PM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Petersen G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Neipel F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Hassel JC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Ehrhardt A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Enk AH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Nettelbeck DM" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24760010</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0095723</DOI><KST>F110</KST><KEYWORD>MALIGNANT-MELANOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VIRAL PARTICLES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BINDING SITE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PANCREATIC-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSGENE EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMPROVES ANTITUMOR EFFICACY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SHORT-FIBER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SEROTYPE 5</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VECTOR TRANSDUCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TARGETING PEPTIDES</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49720</publishedID><Artikel>A Genome-wide Association Study of Early-Onset Breast Cancer Identifies PFKM as a Novel Breast Cancer Gene and Supports a Common Genetic Spectrum for Breast Cancer at Any Age</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers and Prevention</Journal><ABSTr>Early-onset breast cancer (EOBC) causes substantial loss of life and productivity, creating a major burden among women worldwide. We analyzed 1,265,548 Hapmap3 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) among a discovery set of 3,523 EOBC incident cases and 2,702 population control women ages &lt;= 51 years. The SNPs with smallest P values were examined in a replication set of 3,470EOBC cases and 5,475 control women. We also tested EOBC association with 19,684 genes by annotating each gene with putative functional SNPs, and then combining their P values to obtain a gene-based P value. We examined the gene with smallest P value for replication in 1,145 breast cancer cases and 1,142 control women. The combined discovery and replication sets identified 72 new SNPs associated with EOBC(P &lt; 4 x 10(-8)) located in six genomic regions previously reported to contain SNPs associated largely with later-onset breast cancer (LOBC). SNP rs2229882 and 10 other SNPs on chromosome 5q11.2 remained associated (P &lt; 6 x 10(-4)) after adjustment for the strongest published SNPs in the region. Thirty-two of the 82 currently known LOBC SNPs were associated with EOBC (P &lt; 0.05). Low power is likely responsible for the remaining 50 unassociated known LOBC SNPs. The gene-based analysis identified an association between breast cancer and the phosphofructokinase-muscle (PFKM) gene on chromosome 12q13.11 that met the genome-wide gene-based threshold of 2.5 x 10(-6). In conclusion, EOBC and LOBC seem to have similar genetic etiologies; the 5q11.2 region may contain multiple distinct breast cancer loci; and the PFKM gene region is worthy of further investigation. These findings should enhance our understanding of the etiology of breast cancer.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (4), 658-669</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>658</StrtPage><EndPage>669</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ahsan,H."

In this phase 3 study, we evaluated the effect of the addition of bevacizumab to radiotherapy-temozolomide for the treatment of newly diagnosed glioblastoma. METHODS: We randomly assigned patients with supratentorial glioblastoma to receive intravenous bevacizumab (10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks) or placebo, plus radiotherapy (2 Gy 5 days a week; maximum, 60 Gy) and oral temozolomide (75 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day) for 6 weeks. After a 28-day treatment break, maintenance bevacizumab (10 mg per kilogram intravenously every 2 weeks) or placebo, plus temozolomide (150 to 200 mg per square meter per day for 5 days), was continued for six 4-week cycles, followed by bevacizumab monotherapy (15 mg per kilogram intravenously every 3 weeks) or placebo until the disease progressed or unacceptable toxic effects developed. The coprimary end points were investigator-assessed progression-free survival and overall survival. RESULTS: A total of 458 patients were assigned to the bevacizumab group, and 463 patients to the placebo group. The median progression-free survival was longer in the bevacizumab group than in the placebo group (10.6 months vs. 6.2 months; stratified hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55 to 0.74; P&lt;0.001). The benefit with respect to progression-free survival was observed across subgroups. Overall survival did not differ significantly between groups (stratified hazard ratio for death, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.02; P=0.10). The respective overall survival rates with bevacizumab and placebo were 72.4% and 66.3% at 1 year (P=0.049) and 33.9% and 30.1% at 2 years (P=0.24). Baseline health-related quality of life and performance status were maintained longer in the bevacizumab group, and the glucocorticoid requirement was lower. More patients in the bevacizumab group than in the placebo group had grade 3 or higher adverse events (66.8% vs. 51.3%) and grade 3 or higher adverse events often associated with bevacizumab (32.5% vs. 15.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of bevacizumab to radiotherapy-temozolomide did not improve survival in patients with glioblastoma. Improved progression-free survival and maintenance of baseline quality of life and performance status were observed with bevacizumab; however, the rate of adverse events was higher with bevacizumab than with placebo.

METHODS: We conducted a nested case-control study within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) that included 893 incident lung cancer cases and 1,748 matched controls. Circulating levels of tryptophan and six of its metabolites were measured and evaluated in relation to lung cancer risk. RESULTS: Tryptophan (Ptrend = 2 x 10(-5)) and the kynurenine/tryptophan ratio (KTR; Ptrend = 4 x 10(-5)) were associated with lung cancer risk overall after adjusting for established risk factors. The ORs comparing the fifth and first quintiles (OR5th vs. 1st) were 0.52 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.37-0.74] for tryptophan and 1.74 (95% CI, 1.24-2.45) for KTR. After adjusting for plasma methionine (available from previous work, which was strongly correlated with tryptophan), the associations of tryptophan (adjusted Ptrend = 0.13) and KTR (Ptrend = 0.009) were substantially attenuated. KTR was positively associated with squamous cell carcinoma, the OR5th vs. 1st being 2.83 (95% CI, 1.62-4.94, Ptrend = 3 x 10(-5)) that was only marginally affected by adjusting for methionine. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that biomarkers of tryptophan metabolism are associated with subsequent lung cancer risk. Although this result would seem consistent with the immune system having a role in lung cancer development, the overall associations were dependent on methionine, and further studies are warranted to further elucidate the importance of these metabolites in lung cancer etiology. IMPACT: This is the first prospective study investigating the tryptophan pathway in relation to lung cancer risk.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (3), 461-468</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>461</StrtPage><EndPage>468</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Chuang SC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Fanidi A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Ueland PM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Relton C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Midttun O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Vollset SE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Gunter MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Seckl MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Travis RC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Wareham N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Lagiou P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Trichopoulos D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Peeters PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Wientzek A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Kuehn T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="18" name="Kaaks R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="19" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Agnoli C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Palli D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Naccarati A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Aicua EA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Sanchez MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Quiros JR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Chirlaque MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Agudo A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Johansson M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Grankvist K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Boutron-Ruault MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Clavel-Chapelon F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Fagherazzi G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Brennan PJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Vineis P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Johansson M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24357106</PMID><DOI>10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-13-0770</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>B-VITAMIN STATUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INDOLEAMINE 2,3-DIOXYGENASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ONE-CARBON METABOLISM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEOPTERIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMMUNE ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CIGARETTE-SMOKING</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MASS-SPECTROMETRY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DEGRADATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTERFERON-GAMMA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49723</publishedID><Artikel>A novel sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) inhibitor with p53-dependent pro-apoptotic activity in non-small cell lung cancer</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Biological Chemistry</Journal><ABSTr>Sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) is an NAD(+)-dependent protein deacetylase whose targets include histone H4 lysine 16, p53, and alpha-tubulin. Because deacetylation of p53 regulates its effect on apoptosis, pharmacological inhibition of SIRT2-dependent p53 deacetylation is of great therapeutic interest for the treatment of cancer. Here, we have identified two structurally related compounds, AEM1 and AEM2, which are selective inhibitors of SIRT2 (IC50 values of 18.5 and 3.8 muM, respectively), but show only weak effects on other sirtuins such as SIRT1, SIRT3, and yeast Sir2. Interestingly, both compounds sensitized non-small cell lung cancer cell lines toward the induction of apoptosis by the DNA-damaging agent etoposide. Importantly, this sensitization was dependent on the presence of functional p53, thus establishing a link between SIRT2 inhibition by these compounds and p53 activation. Further, treatment with AEM1 and AEM2 led to elevated levels of p53 acetylation and to increased expression of CDKN1A, which encodes the cell cycle regulator p21(WAF1), as well as the pro-apoptotic genes PUMA and NOXA, three transcriptional targets of p53. Altogether, our data suggest that inhibition of SIRT2 by these compounds causes increased activation of p53 by decreasing SIRT2-dependent p53 deacetylation. These compounds thus provide a good opportunity for lead optimization and drug development to target p53-proficient cancers.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>289 (8), 5208-5216</Feld596><PubVol>289</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>5208</StrtPage><EndPage>5216</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hoffmann G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Breitenbuecher F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Schuler M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Ehrenhofer-Murray AE" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24379401</PMID><DOI>10.1074/jbc.M113.487736</DOI><KST>L401</KST><KEYWORD>HISTONE DEACETYLASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>YEAST</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>acetylation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>p53</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FAMILY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SIR2-LIKE PROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NAD-DEPENDENT DEACETYLASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEIN DEACETYLASE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49724</publishedID><Artikel>First experiences with the implementation of the European standard EN 62304 on medical device software for the quality assurance of a radiotherapy unit</Artikel><Journal>Radiation Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: According to the latest amendment of the Medical Device Directive standalone software qualifies as a medical device when intended by the manufacturer to be used for medical purposes. In this context, the EN 62304 standard is applicable which defines the life-cycle requirements for the development and maintenance of medical device software. A pilot project was launched to acquire skills in implementing this standard in a hospital-based environment (in-house manufacture). METHODS: The EN 62304 standard outlines minimum requirements for each stage of the software life-cycle, defines the activities and tasks to be performed and scales documentation and testing according to its criticality. The required processes were established for the pre-existent decision-support software FlashDumpComparator (FDC) used during the quality assurance of treatment-relevant beam parameters. As the EN 62304 standard implicates compliance with the EN ISO 14971 standard on the application of risk management to medical devices, a risk analysis was carried out to identify potential hazards and reduce the associated risks to acceptable levels. RESULTS: The EN 62304 standard is difficult to implement without proper tools, thus open-source software was selected and integrated into a dedicated development platform. The control measures yielded by the risk analysis were independently implemented and verified, and a script-based test automation was retrofitted to reduce the associated test effort. After all documents facilitating the traceability of the specified requirements to the corresponding tests and of the control measures to the proof of execution were generated, the FDC was released as an accessory to the HIT facility. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of the EN 62304 standard was time-consuming, and a learning curve had to be overcome during the first iterations of the associated processes, but many process descriptions and all software tools can be re-utilized in follow-up projects. It has been demonstrated that a standards-compliant development of small and medium-sized medical software can be carried out by a small team with limited resources in a clinical setting. This is of particular relevance as the upcoming revision of the Medical Device Directive is expected to harmonize and tighten the current legal requirements for all European in-house manufacturers.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (), 79-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>79</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Hoss A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Lampe C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Panse R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Ackermann B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Naumann J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Jaekel O" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24655818</PMID><DOI>10.1186/1748-717X-9-79</DOI><KST>E040</KST><KEYWORD>ion therapy</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49725</publishedID><Artikel>Polarized wnt signaling regulates ectodermal cell fate in Xenopus</Artikel><Journal>Developmental Cell</Journal><ABSTr>How cells convert polarity cues into cell fate specification is incompletely understood. Here, we show that Wnt/beta-catenin and Wnt/PCP signaling cooperate in this process in early Xenopus embryos. We find that the Wnt coreceptor Lrp6 is asymmetrically localized to the basolateral membrane in ectodermal blastomeres. Lrp6 asymmetry is controlled by Wnt/PCP signaling, indicating that this pathway regulates not only planar- but also apicobasal cell polarity. Following asymmetric cell division, Lrp6 preferentially sorts to the deep ectodermal cell layer and becomes depleted in the epithelial cell layer. This is accompanied by elevated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in deep cells, which in turn promotes their differentiation into ciliated cells. We conclude that coordinated Wnt/PCP and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling convert apicobasal polarity information to specify ectodermal cell fate.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>29 (2), 250-257</Feld596><PubVol>29</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>250</StrtPage><EndPage>257</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Huang YL" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Niehrs C" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24780739</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.devcel.2014.03.015</DOI><KST>A050</KST><KEYWORD>VERTEBRATE DEVELOPMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PRIMARY NEUROGENESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>C.

To study the transcriptional impact of BRD4 in cancer, we generated an expression signature of BRD4 knockdown cells and found oxidative stress response genes significantly enriched. We integrated the RNA-Seq results with DNA-binding sites of BRD4 generated by chromatin immunoprecipitations, correlated these with gene expressions from human prostate cancers and identified 21 top BRD4 candidate genes among which the oxidative stress pathway genes KEAP1, SESN3 and HDAC6 are represented. Knock down of BRD4 or treatment with the BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 resulted in decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and increased cell viability under H2O2 exposure. Consistently, a deregulation of BRD4 diminished the KEAP1/NRF2 axis and led to a disturbed regulation of the inducible heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1). Without exogenous stress induction, we also found BRD4 directly targeting the HMOX1 promoter over the SP1-binding sites. Our findings provide insight into the transcriptional regulatory network of BRD4 and highlight BRD4 as signal transducer of the cellular response to oxidative stress.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>5 (), e1195-</Feld596><PubVol>5</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>e1195</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Hussong M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Boerno ST" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kerick M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Wunderlich A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Franz A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Sueltmann H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Timmermann B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Lehrach H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Hirsch-Kauffmann M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Schweiger MR" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24763052</PMID><DOI>10.1038/cddis.2014.157</DOI><KST>B063</KST><KEYWORD>KEAP1 GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEME OXYGENASE-1 GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUPER-ENHANCERS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROSTATE-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FANCONI-ANEMIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INDUCIBLE EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>P-TEFB</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NRF2</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SELECTIVE-INHIBITION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49733</publishedID><Artikel>Deciphering Fine Molecular Details of Proteins' Structure and Function with a Protein Surface Topography (PST) Method</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling</Journal><ABSTr>Molecular surfaces are the key players in biomolecular recognition and interactions. Nowadays, it is trivial to visualize a molecular surface and surface-distributed properties in three-dimensional space. However, such a representation trends to be biased and ambiguous in case of thorough analysis. We present a new method to create 2D spherical projection maps of entire protein surfaces and manipulate with them-protein surface topography (PST). It permits visualization and thoughtful analysis of surface properties. PST helps to easily portray conformational transitions, analyze proteins' properties and their dynamic behavior, improve docking performance, and reveal common patterns and dissimilarities in molecular surfaces of related bioactive peptides. This paper describes basic usage of PST with an example of small G-proteins conformational transitions, mapping of caspase-1 intersubunit interface, and intrinsic "complementarity" in the conotoxin-acetylcholine binding protein complex. We suggest that PST is a beneficial approach for structure-function studies of bioactive peptides and small proteins.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>54 (4), 1189-1199</Feld596><PubVol>54</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>1189</StrtPage><EndPage>1199</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Koromyslova AD" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Chugunov AO" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Efremov RG" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24689707</PMID><DOI>10.1021/ci500158y</DOI><KST>F150</KST><KEYWORD>BINDING PROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEURAL-NETWORKS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SODIUM-CHANNELS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTERLEUKIN-1-BETA CONVERTING-ENZYME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ARF</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHOLERA-TOXIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MECHANISM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HYDROPHOBIC PROPERTIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NICOTINIC AGONISTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DOCKING SOLUTIONS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49734</publishedID><Artikel>Theoretical model of the single spin-echo relaxation time for spherical magnetic perturbers</Artikel><Journal>Magnetic Resonance in Medicine</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: Magnetically labeled cells and tissue iron deposits provide qualitative means to detect and monitor cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases with magnetic resonance imaging. However, to quantitatively examine the extent of pathological micromorphological changes, detailed knowledge about microstructural parameters and relaxation times is required. METHODS: The complex geometrical arrangement of spherical magnetic perturbers is considered in an external magnetic field. They create a magnetic dipole field, whose corresponding spin-echo formation is investigated by analyzing the diffusion process in the dephasing volume. Quantitative predictions of the present analysis are compared with experimental data and empirical models. RESULTS: Single spin-echo relaxation times can be characterized by morphological parameters such as magnetic particle concentration and size as well as tissue diffusion coefficient and local magnetic susceptibility properties. As expected, no formation of a static dephasing plateau is observed in contrast to the gradient-echo relaxation time. Instead, the relaxation rate drops for large particle sizes and exhibits a prominent maximal value at intermediate sizes. These findings agree well with experimental data and previous theoretical results.

METHODS: Lifestyle and mortality data from the EPIC-Heidelberg cohort, comprising 22,469 German adults &gt;=40 years and free of pre-existing diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer at recruitment (1994-1998), were analyzed with multivariable Gompertz proportional hazards models to predict lifetime survival probabilities given specific baseline status of lifestyle risk factors. The life table method was then used to estimate the RLEs. RESULTS: For 40-year-old adults, the most significant loss of RLE was associated with smoking (9.4 [95% confidence interval: 8.3, 10.6] years for male and 7.3 [6.0, 8.9] years for female heavy smokers [&gt;10 cigarettes/day]; 5.3 [3.6, 7.1] years for men and 5.0 [3.2, 6.6] years for women smoking &lt;=10 cigarettes/day). Other lifestyle risk factors associated with major losses of RLE were low body mass index (BMI &lt;22.5 kg/m2, 3.5 [1.8, 5.1] years for men; 2.1 [0.5, 3.6] years for women), obesity (BMI &gt;=30, 3.1 [1.9, 4.4] years for men; 3.2 [1.8, 5.1] years for women), heavy alcohol drinking (&gt;4 drinks/day, 3.1 [1.9, 4.0] years for men), and high processed/red meat consumption (&gt;=120 g/day, 2.4 [1.0, 3.9] years for women). The obesity-associated loss of RLE was stronger in male never smokers, while the loss of RLE associated with low BMI was stronger in current smokers. The loss of RLE associated with low leisure time physical activity was moderate for women (1.1 [0.05, 2.1] year) and negligible for men (0.4 [-0.3, 1.2] years). The combined loss of RLE for heavy smoking, obesity, heavy alcohol drinking and high processed/red meat consumption, versus never smoking, optimal BMI (22.5 to 24.9), no/light alcohol drinking and low processed/red meat consumption, was 17.0 years for men and 13.9 years for women. CONCLUSIONS: Avoiding basic lifestyle risk factors, particularly cigarette smoking and unhealthy body weight, could substantially increase the RLE of middle-aged adults and should be the top public health priority to reduce premature deaths in Germany and similar affluent societies.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>12 (1), Art.

Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associated with genetic susceptibility to multiple myeloma were identified in the last years, but only a few of them were validated in independent studies. METHODS: With the aim to conclusively validate the strongest associations so far reported, we selected the polymorphisms rs2227667 (SERPINE1), rs17501108 (HGF), rs3136685 (CCR7), rs16944 (IL1B), rs12147254 (TRAF3), rs1805087 (MTR), rs1800629 (TNF-alpha), rs7516435 (CASP9), rs1042265 (BAX), rs2234922 (mEH), and rs1801133 (MTHFR). We genotyped them in 1,498 multiple myeloma cases and 1,934 controls ascertained in the context of the International Multiple Myeloma rESEarch (IMMEnSE) consortium, and meta-analyzed our results with previously published ones. RESULTS: None of the selected SNPs were significantly associated with multiple myeloma risk (P value range, 0.055-0.981), possibly with the exception of the SNP rs2227667 (SERPINE1) in women. CONCLUSIONS: We can exclude that the selected polymorphisms are major multiple myeloma risk factors. IMPACT: Independent validation studies are crucial to identify true genetic risk factors. Our large-scale study clarifies the role of previously published polymorphisms in multiple myeloma risk.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (4), 670-674</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>670</StrtPage><EndPage>674</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Martino A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Campa D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Jurczyszyn A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Martinez-Lopez J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Moreno MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Varkonyi J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Dumontet C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Garcia-Sanz R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Gemignani F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Jamroziak K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Stepiel A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Jacobsen SE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Andersen V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Jurado M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Landi S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Rossi AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Lesueur F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Marques H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Dudzilski M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Watek M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Moreno V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Orciuolo E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Petrini M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Reis RM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Rios R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Sainz J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Vogel U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Buda G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Vangsted AJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Canzian F" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24521996</PMID><DOI>10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-13-1115</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KST>C055</KST></row><row><publishedID>49739</publishedID><Artikel>Helicobacter pylori antibody patterns in Germany: a cross-sectional population study</Artikel><Journal>Gut Pathogens</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori infection that is usually acquired in childhood and lasts for lifetime is mostly asymptomatic but associated with severe gastrointestinal disease including cancer. During chronic infection, the gastric mucosa is histologically changing. This forces H. pylori to permanent adaptation in its gastric habitat by expression of different proteins which might be reflected in distinctive antibody patterns. METHODS: To characterize dynamics of the immune response to H. pylori we analysed 1797 sera of a cross-sectional study representative for the German population (age range 1-82 years) with multiplex serology, a fluorescent bead-based antibody binding assay that allows simultaneous and quantitative detection of antibodies. Fifteen recombinant, affinity-purified H. pylori proteins (UreA, GroEL, Catalase, NapA, CagA, CagM, Cagdelta, HP0231, VacA, HpaA, Cad, HyuA, Omp, HcpC and HP0305) were used as antigens. RESULTS: H. pylori seroprevalence (positivity for at least three antigens) was 48% and increased with age from 12% in children &lt;15 years to 69% in females and 90% in males &gt;65 years. Prevalences were highest (&gt;83%) for Omp, VacA and GroEL. For 11 proteins, seroprevalence was higher in males than females (P &lt; 0.05) from age 55 onwards. For all antigens, the median prevalence increase per age decade was stronger in males (8.4%, range 3.8-12.9%) than females (6.1%, range 3.4-10.8%). However, among seropositives the median number of antigens recognized increased from children &lt;15 years to individuals &gt;65 years stronger in females (P = 0.02). Antibody reactivities to GroEL, HyuA, CagM, Catalase, NapA and UreA also increased stronger in females (average 1.7-fold/decade, SD 0.5) than in males (1.5-fold/decade, SD 0.4). CONCLUSION: H. pylori antibody response accumulates qualitatively and quantitatively with age. This may reflect a lifelong stimulation of the immune response by chronically active infection.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>6 (), Art.

However, t(14;18) is also detectable in the blood of otherwise healthy persons, and its relationship with progression to disease remains unclear. Here we sought to determine whether t(14;18)-positive cells in healthy individuals represent tumor precursors and whether their detection could be used as an early predictor for FL. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Among 520,000 healthy participants enrolled onto the EPIC (European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition) cohort, we identified 100 who developed FL 2 to 161 months after enrollment. Prediagnostic blood from these and 218 controls were screened for t(14;18) using sensitive polymerase chain reaction-based assays. Results were subsequently validated in an independent cohort (65 case participants; 128 controls). Clonal relationships between t(14;18) cells and FL were also assessed by molecular backtracking of paired prediagnostic blood and tumor samples. RESULTS: Clonal analysis of t(14;18) junctions in paired prediagnostic blood versus tumor samples demonstrated that progression to FL occurred from t(14;18)-positive committed precursors. Furthermore, healthy participants at enrollment who developed FL up to 15 years later showed a markedly higher t(14;18) prevalence and frequency than controls (P &lt; .001). Altogether, we estimated a 23-fold higher risk of subsequent FL in blood samples associated with a frequency &gt; 10(-4) (odds ratio, 23.17; 95% CI, 9.98 to 67.31; P &lt; .001). Remarkably, risk estimates remained high and significant up to 15 years before diagnosis. CONCLUSION: High t(14;18) frequency in blood from healthy individuals defines the first predictive biomarker for FL, effective years before diagnosis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>32 (13), 1347-1355</Feld596><PubVol>32</PubVol><PubIss>13</PubIss><StrtPage>1347</StrtPage><EndPage>1355</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Roulland S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Kelly RS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Morgado E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Sungalee S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Solal-Celigny P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Colombat P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Jouve N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Palli D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Pala V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Panico S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Sacerdote C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Quiros JR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Gonzales CA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Sanchez MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Dorronsoro M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Navarro C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Barricarte A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Olsen A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Canzian F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="22" name="Kaaks R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="23" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Drogan D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Nieters A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Clavel-Chapelon F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Trichopoulos D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Lagiou P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Peeters PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Vermeulen R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Hallmans G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Melin B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Borgquist S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Carlson J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Lund E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Wareham N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Key TJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Travis RC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Ferrari P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="44" name="Romieu I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="45" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="46" name="Salles G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="47" name="Vineis P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="48" name="Nadel B" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24687831</PMID><DOI>10.1200/JCO.2013.52.8190</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KST>C055</KST><KEYWORD>MONOCLONAL GAMMOPATHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>B-CELL LYMPHOCYTOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NON-HODGKIN-LYMPHOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SOMATIC MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>UNDETERMINED SIGNIFICANCE MGUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEALTHY-INDIVIDUALS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC-LEUKEMIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGENITOR CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SMOLDERING MULTIPLE-MYELOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LOW-TUMOR-BURDEN</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49745</publishedID><Artikel>A novel intronic promoter of the Crem gene induces small ICER (smICER) isoforms</Artikel><Journal>FASEB Journal</Journal><ABSTr>The transcription factors cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) and cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM) regulate gene transcription in response to elevated cAMP levels. The Crem isoform inducible cAMP early repressor (Icer) is transcribed by the internal promoter P2 as a critical regulator of multiple cellular processes. Here, we describe a novel inducible Crem isoform, small Icer (smIcer), regulated by a newly identified promoter (P6). ChIP revealed binding of CREB to P6 in human and mouse myocardium. P6 activity was induced by constitutively active CREB or stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. In mice, smIcer mRNA was ubiquitously expressed and transiently induced by beta-adrenoceptor stimulation e.g., in heart and lung. SmICER repressed both basal and cAMP-induced activities of P6 and P2 promoters. Stimulation of adenylyl cyclase induced P2 and P6 in cell type-specific manner. Alternative translational start sites resulted in three different smICER proteins, linked to increased apoptosis sensitivity. In conclusion, the Crem gene provides two distinct and mutually controlled mechanisms of a cAMP-dependent induction of transcriptional repressors. Our results suggest not only that smICER is a novel regulator of cAMP-mediated gene regulation, but also emphasize that biological effects that have been ascribed solely to ICER, should be revised with regard to smICER.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>28 (1), 143-152</Feld596><PubVol>28</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>143</StrtPage><EndPage>152</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Seidl MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Nunes F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Fels B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Hildebrandt I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schmitz W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Schulze-Osthoff K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Muller FU" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24022402</PMID><DOI>10.1096/fj.13-231977</DOI><KST>L801</KST><KEYWORD>CAMP EARLY REPRESSOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RESPONSE ELEMENT MODULATOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS CREB</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AMP EARLY REPRESSOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL-PROLIFERATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MESSENGER-RNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FEEDBACK LOOP</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BETA-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BINDING-PROTEIN</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49746</publishedID><Artikel>Cytochrome b5 and epoxide hydrolase contribute to benzo[a]pyrene-DNA adduct formation catalyzed by cytochrome P450 1A1 under low NADPH:P450 oxidoreductase conditions</Artikel><Journal>Toxicology</Journal><ABSTr>In previous studies we had administered benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) to genetically engineered mice (HRN) which do not express NADPH:cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR) in hepatocytes and observed higher DNA adduct levels in livers of these mice than in wild-type mice. To elucidate the reason for this unexpected finding we have used two different settings for in vitro incubations; hepatic microsomes from control and BaP-pretreated HRN mice and reconstituted systems with cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), POR, cytochrome b5, and epoxide hydrolase (mEH) in different ratios. In microsomes from BaP-pretreated mice, in which Cyp1a1 was induced, higher levels of BaP metabolites were formed, mainly of BaP-7,8-dihydrodiol. At a low POR:CYP1A1 ratio of 0.05:1 in the reconstituted system, the amounts of BaP diones and BaP-9-ol formed were essentially the same as at an equimolar ratio, but formation of BaP-3-ol was approximately 1.6-fold higher. Only after addition of mEH were BaP dihydrodiols found. Two BaP-DNA adducts were formed in the presence of mEH, but only one when CYP1A1 and POR were present alone. At a ratio of POR:CYP1A1 of 0.05:1, addition of cytochrome b5 increased CYP1A1-mediated BaP oxidation to most of its metabolites indicating that cytochrome b5 participates in the electron transfer from NADPH to CYP1A1 required for enzyme activity of this CYP. BaP-9-ol was formed even by CYP1A1 reconstituted with cytochrome b5 without POR. Our results suggest that in livers of HRN mice Cyp1a1, cytochrome b5 and mEH can effectively activate BaP to DNA binding species, even in the presence of very low amounts of POR.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>318 (), 1-12</Feld596><PubVol>318</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>1</StrtPage><EndPage>12</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Stiborova M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Moserova M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Cerna V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Indra R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Dracinsky M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Sulc M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Henderson CJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Wolf CR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Schmeiser HH" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Phillips DH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Frei E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Arlt VM" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24530354</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.tox.2014.02.002</DOI><KST>E030</KST><KST>G120</KST><KST>C016</KST><KEYWORD>DNA-ADDUCTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>P450 REDUCTASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANTICANCER DRUG ELLIPTICINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METABOLIC-ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MASS-SPECTROMETRY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NADPH-CYTOCHROME-P-450 REDUCTASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>P450-P450 INTERACTIONS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49747</publishedID><Artikel>Genes-environment interactions in obesity- and diabetes-associated pancreatic cancer: a GWAS data analysis</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers and Prevention</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Obesity and diabetes are potentially alterable risk factors for pancreatic cancer. Genetic factors that modify the associations of obesity and diabetes with pancreatic cancer have previously not been examined at the genome-wide level. METHODS: Using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) genotype and risk factor data from the Pancreatic Cancer Case Control Consortium, we conducted a discovery study of 2,028 cases and 2,109 controls to examine gene-obesity and gene-diabetes interactions in relation to pancreatic cancer risk by using the likelihood-ratio test nested in logistic regression models and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). RESULTS: After adjusting for multiple comparisons, a significant interaction of the chemokine signaling pathway with obesity (P = 3.29 x 10(-6)) and a near significant interaction of calcium signaling pathway with diabetes (P = 1.57 x 10(-4)) in modifying the risk of pancreatic cancer were observed. These findings were supported by results from IPA analysis of the top genes with nominal interactions. The major contributing genes to the two top pathways include GNGT2, RELA, TIAM1, and GNAS. None of the individual genes or single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) except one SNP remained significant after adjusting for multiple testing. Notably, SNP rs10818684 of the PTGS1 gene showed an interaction with diabetes (P = 7.91 x 10(-7)) at a false discovery rate of 6%. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variations in inflammatory response and insulin resistance may affect the risk of obesity- and diabetes-related pancreatic cancer. These observations should be replicated in additional large datasets. IMPACT: A gene-environment interaction analysis may provide new insights into the genetic susceptibility and molecular mechanisms of obesity- and diabetes-related pancreatic cancer.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (1), 98-106</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>98</StrtPage><EndPage>106</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Tang H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Wei P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Duell EJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Risch HA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Olson SH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Gallinger S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Holly EA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Petersen GM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Bracci PM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="McWilliams RR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Jenab M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Boutron-Ruault MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Kaaks R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="16" name="Trichopoulos D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Panico S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Sund M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Peeters PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Amos CI" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Li D" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24136929</PMID><DOI>10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-13-0437-</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHWAYS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISEASES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NF-KAPPA-B</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VARIANTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POWERFUL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MISSING HERITABILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>susceptibility loci</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BODY-MASS INDEX</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49748</publishedID><Artikel>Randomized phase II trial of hypofractionated proton versus carbon ion radiation therapy in patients with sacrococcygeal chordoma-the ISAC trial protocol</Artikel><Journal>Radiation Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Chordomas are relatively rare lesions of the bones. About 30% occur in the sacrococcygeal region. Surgical resection is still the standard treatment. Due to the size, proximity to neurovascular structures and the complex anatomy of the pelvis, a complete resection with adequate safety margin is difficult to perform. A radical resection with safety margins often leads to the loss of bladder and rectal function as well as motoric/sensoric dysfunction. The recurrence rate after surgery alone is comparatively high, such that adjuvant radiation therapy is very important for improving local control rates. Proton therapy is still the international standard in the treatment of chordomas. High-LET beams such as carbon ions theoretically offer biologic advantages in slow-growing tumors. Data of a Japanese study of patients with unresectable sacral chordoma showed comparable high control rates after hypofractionated carbon ion therapy only.Methods and design: This clinical study is a prospective randomized, monocentric phase II trial. Patients with histologically confirmed sacrococcygeal chordoma will be randomized to either proton or carbon ion radiation therapy stratified regarding the clinical target volume. Target volume delineation will be carried out based on CT and MRI data. In each arm the PTV will receive 64 GyE in 16 fractions. The primary objective of this trial is safety and feasibility of hypofractionated irradiation in patients with sacrococygeal chordoma using protons or carbon ions in raster scan technique for primary or additive treatment after R2 resection. The evaluation is therefore based on the proportion of treatments without Grade 3-5 toxicity (CTCAE, version 4.0) up to 12 months after treatment and/or discontinuation of the treatment for any reason as primary endpoint. Local-progression free survival, overall survival and quality of life will be analyzed as secondary end points. DISCUSSION: The aim of this study is to confirm the toxicity results of the Japanese data in raster scan technique and to compare it with the toxicity analysis of proton therapy given in the same fractionation. Using this data, a further randomized phase III trial is planned, comparing hypofractionated proton and carbon ion irradiation.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01811394.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (1), Art.

However, little is known about the mechanism that controls these molecules during neuronal development. Here, we identify several components of the ubiquitin proteasome system and the cell-cycle machinery that act upstream of FEZ1. We demonstrate that the ubiquitin ligase cell division cycle 20/anaphase-promoting complex (Cdc20/APC) controls dendrite growth by regulating the degradation of FEZ1. Furthermore, dendrite growth is modulated by BubR1, whose known function so far has been restricted to control Cdc20/APC activity during the cell cycle. The modulatory function of BubR1 is dependent on its acetylation status. We show that BubR1 is deacetylated by Hdac11, thereby disinhibiting the Cdc20/APC complex. Because dendrite growth is affected both in hippocampal dentate granule cells and olfactory bulb neurons upon modifying expression of these genes, we conclude that the proposed mechanism governs neuronal development in a general fashion.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>7 (2), 552-564</Feld596><PubVol>7</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>552</StrtPage><EndPage>564</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Watanabe Y" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Khodosevich K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Monyer H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24726361</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.celrep.2014.03.022</DOI><KST>A230</KST><KEYWORD>BUBR1 ACETYLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MITOTIC CHECKPOINT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MAMMALIAN BRAIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADULT HIPPOCAMPAL NEUROGENESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>spindle assembly checkpoint</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATTERN SEPARATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEWLY GENERATED NEURONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHROMOSOMAL INSTABILITY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49750</publishedID><Artikel>Genetic diagnosis in malignant hemopathies: from cytogenetics to next-generation sequencing</Artikel><Journal>Expert Review of Molecular Diagnostics</Journal><ABSTr>Since the first specific chromosomal abnormality was identified in leukemia more than 50 years ago, technology has much evolved, now allowing the deciphering of cancer genomes in ever-greater detail. However, much has still to be learned as we have not yet completely dissected all the genomic aberrations driving the genesis and the evolution of malignant hemopathies. The first techniques that have been developed allowed 'gross' chromosomal abnormalities to be identified. They include conventional and molecular cytogenetics and microarray-based techniques. However, these techniques can only reveal part of the problem, as genes can be altered in a number of ways (mutations, methylation and so on). This led to the development of what is now known as next-generation sequencing (NGS). Each method has advantages and limits. At present, no single method can decipher all the mechanisms involved in leukemogenesis. Therefore, in our view, it is unlikely that a particular technique will become the 'gold standard'.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>14 (2), 127-129</Feld596><PubVol>14</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>127</StrtPage><EndPage>129</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="De Braekeleer E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Douet-Guilbert N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="De Braekeleer M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24437978</PMID><DOI>10.1586/14737159.2014.872563</DOI><KST>A010</KST><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>leukemia</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49751</publishedID><Artikel>How Parkinson's disease meets nucleolar stress</Artikel><Journal>Biochimica et Biophysica Acta</Journal><ABSTr>Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. Although the causes of PD are still not understood, aging is a predisposing factor and metabolic stress seems to be a common trigger. Interestingly, the response to stress conditions and quality control mechanisms is impaired in PD, as well as in other neurodegenerative disorders. Downregulation of rRNA transcription is one major strategy to maintain cellular homeostasis under stress conditions, as it limits energy consumption in disadvantageous circumstances. Altered rRNA transcription and disruption of nucleolar integrity are associated with neurodegenerative disorders, and with aging. Nucleolar stress can be triggered by genetic and epigenetic factors, and by specific signaling mechanisms, that are altered in neurodegenerative disorders. The consequences of neuronal nucleolar stress seem to depend on p53 function, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity and deregulation of protein translation. In this review, we will summarize findings identifying an emerging role of nucleolar stress for the onset and progression of in particular PD. Emphasis is given to similarities in molecular causes and consequences of nucleolar stress in other neurodegenerative disorders. The mechanisms by which nucleolar stress participates in PD could help identify novel risk factors, and develop new therapeutic strategies to slow down the progressive loss of neurons in neurodegenerative diseases.

Depending on the prevailing polarization profile of these infiltrating leucocytes, tumorigenesis is either promoted or blocked. Here, we identify IkappaB kinase alpha (IKKalpha) as a central regulator of a tumoricidal microenvironment during intestinal carcinogenesis. Mice deficient in IKKalpha kinase activity are largely protected from intestinal tumor development that is dependent on the enhanced recruitment of interferon gamma (IFNgamma)-expressing M1-like myeloid cells. In IKKalpha mutant mice, M1-like polarization is not controlled in a cell-autonomous manner but, rather, depends on the interplay of both IKKalpha mutant tumor epithelia and immune cells. Because therapies aiming at the tumor microenvironment rather than directly at the mutated cancer cell may circumvent resistance development, we suggest IKKalpha as a promising target for colorectal cancer (CRC) therapy.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>7 (6), 1914-1925</Feld596><PubVol>7</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>1914</StrtPage><EndPage>1925</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Goktuna SI" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Canli O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bollrath J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Fingerle AA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Horst D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Diamanti MA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Pallangyo C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Bennecke M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Nebelsiek T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Mankan AK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Lang R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Artis D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Hu Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Patzelt T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Ruland J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Kirchner T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="16" name="Taketo MM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Chariot A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Arkan MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Greten FR" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24882009</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.celrep.2014.05.006</DOI><KST>L501</KST><KST>L701</KST><KEYWORD>GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NF-KAPPA-B</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METASTASIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>microenvironment</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR-INITIATING CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>inflammation</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49766</publishedID><Artikel>Genetic targeting of B-RafV600E affects survival and proliferation and identifies selective agents against BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer cells</Artikel><Journal>Molecular Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancers carrying the B-Raf V600E-mutation are associated with a poor prognosis. The purpose of this study was to identify B-RafV600E-mediated traits of cancer cells in a genetic in vitro model and to assess the selective sensitization of B-RafV600E-mutant cancer cells towards therapeutic agents. METHODS: Somatic cell gene targeting was used to generate subclones of the colorectal cancer cell line RKO containing either wild-type or V600E-mutant B-Raf kinase. Cell-biologic analyses were performed in order to link cancer cell traits to the BRAF-mutant genotype. Subsequently, the corresponding tumor cell clones were characterized pharmacogenetically to identify therapeutic agents exhibiting selective sensitivity in B-RafV600E-mutant cells. RESULTS: Genetic targeting of mutant BRAF resulted in restoration of sensitivity to serum starvation-induced apoptosis and efficiently inhibited cell proliferation in the absence of growth factors. Among tested agents, the B-Raf inhibitor dabrafenib was found to induce a strong V600E-dependent shift in cell viability. In contrast, no differential sensitizing effect was observed for conventional chemotherapeutic agents (mitomycin C, oxaliplatin, paclitaxel, etoposide, 5-fluorouracil), nor for the targeted agents cetuximab, sorafenib, vemurafenib, RAF265, or for inhibition of PI3 kinase. Treatment with dabrafenib efficiently inhibited phosphorylation of the B-Raf downstream targets Mek 1/2 and Erk 1/2. CONCLUSION: Mutant BRAF alleles mediate self-sufficiency of growth signals and serum starvation-induced resistance to apoptosis. Targeting of the BRAF mutation leads to a loss of these hallmarks of cancer. Dabrafenib selectively inhibits cell viability in B-RafV600E mutant cancer cells.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>13 (1), Art.

Twenty patients with metastatic colorectal cancer from the CIOX trial were included. A total of 151 target lesions were defined by baseline computed tomography and followed until disease progression. All assessments were performed by a single reader. A variance component model was used to compare the three volume versions.

There was a significant difference between the SaV and RECIST-based tumour volumes. The same model showed no significant difference between the SaV and WHO-based volumes. Scatter plots showed that the RECIST-based volumes overestimate lesion volume. The agreement between the SaV and WHO-based relative changes in tumour volume, evaluated by intraclass correlation, showed nearly perfect agreement.

Estimating the volume of metastatic lesions using both the LD and LOD (WHO) is more accurate than those based on LD only (RECIST), which overestimates lesion volume. The good agreement between the SaV and WHO-based relative changes in tumour volume enables a reasonable approximation of three-dimensional tumour burden.

Despite new staging criteria, which take into account the viability of a myeloma lesion, positron emission tomography (PET) is not used routinely.

The impact of PET is therefore open. The role of PET and PET computed tomography (PET-CT) for the diagnosis and therapy management is discussed.

The use of PET with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) allows the measurement of viable myeloma lesions and correlates with the stage of disease. A negative FDG examination correlates with a better prognosis. Furthermore, the number of focal lesions as well as the whole functional volume of myeloma lesions in FDG have a prognostic impact. Several studies have demonstrated the impact of FDG for the assessment of therapy monitoring and show that FDG is an earlier indicator for therapy response as compared to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The CT component of the new hybrid systems allows the assessment of osteolytic lesions in CT and their viability in FDG. The combination of PET with an MRT scanner allows the simultaneous measurement of bone marrow infiltration, focal lesions and their viability.

The use of modern hybrid scanners, such as PET-CT and PET-MRT facilitates the simultaneous measurement of viable myeloma lesions, osteolytic lesions and bone marrow infiltration in the whole body; therefore, it is expected that these imaging modalities will play a greater role both in diagnosis and therapy management.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>54 (6), 564-571</Feld596><PubVol>54</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>564</StrtPage><EndPage>571</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Dimitrakopoulou-Strauss,A."

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-protein coding RNAs that regulate gene expression on the post-transcriptional level. Recently, it was shown that p53 regulates the expression of several miRNAs, thereby representing an important mechanism of p53 signaling. Several independent studies identified the members of the miR-34 family as the most prevalent p53-induced miRNAs. miR-34s are frequently silenced in variety of tumor entities, suggesting that they are important tumor suppressors. Indeed, ectopic expression of miR-34s inhibits proliferation, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, migration, invasion, and metastasis of various cancer cell entities. Moreover, delivery or re-expression of miR-34 leads to notable repression of tumor growth and metastasis in cancer mouse models, and may therefore represent an efficient strategy for future cancer therapeutics. Besides their crucial functions in cancer, members of the miR-34 family also play important roles in spermatogenesis, stem cell differentiation, neuronal development, aging, and cardiovascular functions. Consequently, miR-34 has also been implicated in various non-cancerous diseases, such as brain disorders, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular complications.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>6 (3), 214-230</Feld596><PubVol>6</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>214</StrtPage><EndPage>230</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Rokavec M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Li H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Jiang L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Hermeking H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24815299</PMID><DOI>10.1093/jmcb/mju003</DOI><KST>L701</KST><KEYWORD>INHIBITS PROSTATE-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPITHELIAL-MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MICRORNA EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR-INITIATING CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NONALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEGATIVE FEEDBACK LOOP</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL LUNG-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STEM-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLON-CANCER</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49882</publishedID><Artikel>Survival for haematological malignancies in Europe 1997-2008 by region and age: results of a EUROCARE-5 population-based study</Artikel><Journal>Lancet Oncology</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>15 (9), 931-942</Feld596><PubVol>15</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>931</StrtPage><EndPage>942</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Sant M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Minicozzi P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Mounier M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Anderson L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Holleczek B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Marcos-Gragera R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Maynadié M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Monnereau A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Osca-Gelis G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Visser O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="De Angelis R, and the EUROCARE-5 Working Group" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25030467</PMID><DOI>10.1016/S1470-2045(14)70282-7</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>LONG-TERM SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC-LEUKEMIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHRONIC MYELOID-LEUKEMIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>imatinib</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHEMOTHERAPY PLUS RITUXIMAB</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PERIOD ANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>cancer registries</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>B-CELL LYMPHOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HAEMACARE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49954</publishedID><Artikel>Oncogenic roles of EMT-inducing transcription factors</Artikel><Journal>Nature Cell Biology</Journal><ABSTr>The plasticity of cancer cells underlies their capacity to adapt to the selective pressures they encounter during tumour development.

The cure of particularly aggressive malignancies requires induction of immunogenic cell death (ICD), coupling oncolysis with immune responses via calreticulin, ATP, and high-mobility group box protein B1 (HMGB1) release from dying tumor cells. The present study shows that in human pancreatic cancer cells (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [PDAC] cells n=4), oncolytic parvovirus H-1 (H-1PV) activated multiple interconnected death pathways but failed to induce calreticulin exposure or ATP release. In contrast, H-1PV elevated extracellular HMGB1 levels by 4.0+/-0.5 times (58%+/-9% of total content; up to 100 ng/ml) in all infected cultures, whether nondying, necrotic, or apoptotic. An alternative secretory route allowed H-1PV to overcome the failure of gemcitabine to trigger HMGB1 release, without impeding cytotoxicity or other ICD activities of the standard PDAC medication. Such broad resistance of H-1PV-induced HMGB1 release to apoptotic blockage coincided with but was uncoupled from an autocrine interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) loop. That and the pattern of viral determinants maintained in gemcitabine-treated cells suggested the activation of an inflammasome/caspase 1 (CASP1) platform alongside DNA detachment and/or nuclear exclusion of HMGB1 during early stages of the viral life cycle. We concluded that H-1PV infection of PDAC cells is signaled through secretion of the alarmin HMGB1 and, besides its own oncolytic effect, might convert drug-induced apoptosis into an ICD process. A transient arrest of cells in the cyclin A1-rich S phase would suffice to support compatibility of proliferation-dependent H-1PV with cytotoxic regimens. These properties warrant incorporation of the oncolytic virus H-1PV, which is not pathogenic in humans, into multimodal anticancer treatments. IMPORTANCE: The current therapeutic concepts targeting aggressive malignancies require an induction of immunogenic cell death characterized by exposure of calreticulin (CRT) as well as release of ATP and HMGB1 from dying cells. In pancreatic tumor cells (PDAC cells) infected with the oncolytic parvovirus H-1PV, only HMGB1 was released by all infected cells, whether nondying, necrotic, or succumbing to one of the programmed death pathways, including contraproductive apoptosis. Our data suggest that active secretion of HMGB1 from PDAC cells is a sentinel reaction emerging during early stages of the viral life cycle, irrespective of cell death, that is compatible with and complements cytotoxic regimens. Consistent induction of HMGB1 secretion raised the possibility that this reaction might be a general "alarming" phenomenon characteristic of H-1PV's interaction with the host cell; release of IL-1beta points to the possible involvement of a danger-sensing inflammasome platform. Both provide a basis for further virus-oriented studies.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>88 (10), 5263-5276</Feld596><PubVol>88</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>5263</StrtPage><EndPage>5276</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Angelova AL" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Grekova SP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Heller A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kuhlmann O" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Soyka E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Giese T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Aprahamian M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Bour G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Ruffer S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Cziepluch C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Daeffler L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Rommelaere J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Werner J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Raykov Z" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="14" name="Giese NA" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24574398</PMID><DOI>10.1128/JVI.03688-13</DOI><KST>F010</KST><KEYWORD>CARCINOMA CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MINUTE VIRUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VITRO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DENDRITIC CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RELEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHROMATIN PROTEIN HMGB1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NECROSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN IMMUNE-SYSTEM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MICE INFECTION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49960</publishedID><Artikel>Combined PET/MR: Where are we now?

Discussions were focused on the search for truly novel, unique clinical and research applications as well as technical issues such as reliable and accurate approaches for attenuation and scatter correction of PET emission data. The workshop provided hands-on experience with PET and MR imaging. In addition, structured and moderated open discussion sessions, including six dialogue boards and two roundtable discussions, provided input from current and future PET/MR imaging users. This summary provides a snapshot of the current achievements and challenges for PET/MR.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>16 (3), 295-310</Feld596><PubVol>16</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>295</StrtPage><EndPage>310</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Bailey DL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Barthel H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Beuthin-Baumann B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Beyer T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Bisdas S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Boellaard R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Czernin J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Drzezga A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Ernemann U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Franzius C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Guckel B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Handgretinger R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Hartenbach M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Hellwig D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Nadel H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Nekolla SG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Pfluger T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Pichler BJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Quick HH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Sabri O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Sattler B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Schaefer J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Schick F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Siegel BA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Schlemmer HP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="25" name="Schwenzer NF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="van den Hoff J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Veit-Haibach P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Wehrl HF" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24668195</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s11307-014-0725-4</DOI><KST>E010</KST><KEYWORD>ONCOLOGIC PET/MRI</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURFACE COILS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>F-18-FDG PET</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CLINICAL-EXPERIENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ATTENUATION CORRECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SCANNER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MRI</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>brain</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SYSTEM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ARTIFACTS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49961</publishedID><Artikel>Recurrent somatic mutations in ACVR1 in pediatric midline high-grade astrocytoma</Artikel><Journal>Nature Genetics</Journal><ABSTr>Pediatric midline high-grade astrocytomas (mHGAs) are incurable with few treatment targets identified. Most tumors harbor mutations encoding p.Lys27Met in histone H3 variants. In 40 treatment-naive mHGAs, 39 analyzed by whole-exome sequencing, we find additional somatic mutations specific to tumor location. Gain-of-function mutations in ACVR1 occur in tumors of the pons in conjunction with histone H3.1 p.Lys27Met substitution, whereas FGFR1 mutations or fusions occur in thalamic tumors associated with histone H3.3 p.Lys27Met substitution. Hyperactivation of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-ACVR1 developmental pathway in mHGAs harboring ACVR1 mutations led to increased levels of phosphorylated SMAD1, SMAD5 and SMAD8 and upregulation of BMP downstream early-response genes in tumor cells. Global DNA methylation profiles were significantly associated with the p.Lys27Met alteration, regardless of the mutant histone H3 variant and irrespective of tumor location, supporting the role of this substitution in driving the epigenetic phenotype. This work considerably expands the number of potential treatment targets and further justifies pretreatment biopsy in pediatric mHGA as a means to orient therapeutic efforts in this disease.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>46 (5), 462-466</Feld596><PubVol>46</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>462</StrtPage><EndPage>466</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Fontebasso AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Papillon-Cavanagh S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Schwartzentruber J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Nikbakht H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Gerges N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Fiset PO" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Bechet D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Faury D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="De Jay N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Ramkissoon LA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Corcoran A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Jones DT" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Sturm D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Johann P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="14" name="Tomita T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Goldman S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Nagib M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Bendel A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Goumnerova L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Bowers DC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Leonard JR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Rubin JB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Alden T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Browd S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Geyer JR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Leary S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Jallo G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Cohen K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Gupta N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Prados MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Carret AS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Ellezam B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Crevier L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Klekner A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Bognar L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Hauser P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Garami M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Myseros J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Dong Z" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Siegel PM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Malkin H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Ligon AH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Albrecht S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Pfister SM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="44" name="Ligon KL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="45" name="Majewski J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="46" name="Jabado N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="47" name="Kieran MW" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24705250</PMID><DOI>10.1038/ng.2950</DOI><KST>B062</KST><KEYWORD>MOUSE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTRINSIC PONTINE GLIOMAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HISTONE H3.3</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUBGROUPS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLIOBLASTOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FIBRODYSPLASIA OSSIFICANS PROGRESSIVA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BMP RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>I RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALK2</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49962</publishedID><Artikel>Differential effects of erufosine on proliferation, wound healing and apoptosis in colorectal cancer cell lines</Artikel><Journal>Oncology Reports</Journal><ABSTr>The alkylphosphocholine, erucylphospho-N,N, N-trimethylpropanolamine (erufosine), has demonstrated anticancer effects in various cell lines, including leukemia, multiple myeloma, bladder, breast and oral squamous cell carcinoma cells. The purpose of the present study was to investigate its antiproliferative, antimigratory and pro-apoptotic effects in colorectal cancer cell lines, SW480 and CC531. The antiproliferative effect was determined by (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (MTT) dye reduction assay following exposure to erufosine (3.1-100 microM) for 24-72 h. The antimigratory effect of erufosine (1.6-6 microM) was investigated by a wound healing assay for 12-48 h. Caspase-3/-7 activity was measured to detect apoptotic cell death. Erufosine inhibited cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The IC50 values following 72 h of incubation were 3.4 and 25.4 microM for SW480 and CC531 cells, respectively. erufosine at concentrations of 50 and 100 microM induced caspase-3/-7 activity concentration-dependently in SW480 cells, but only at 100 microM in CC531 cells. Incubation of SW480 cells with erufosine (1.56 microM) for 48 h inhibited migration into the scratched area by 54% as compared to the untreated cells; whereas in CC531 cells, the wound width in the erufosine-treated (1.56-6.25 microM) cells following 48 h was closed 2-fold slower than the rate in the untreated group. Erufosine (25 microM) attenuated osteonectin expression and abolished COL1A1 expression in CC531 cells. Erufosine appears to be a promising treatment agent for colorectal cancer. Rat CC531 cells are less sensitive to erufosine than human SW480 cells.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>31 (3), 1407-1416</Feld596><PubVol>31</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>1407</StrtPage><EndPage>1416</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kaleagasioglu F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Berger MR" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24366062</PMID><DOI>10.3892/or.2013.2942</DOI><KST>G401</KST><KEYWORD>PLUS OXALIPLATIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FINAL REPORT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CLINICAL-APPLICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RANDOMIZED PHASE-III</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Alkylphosphocholine</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>1ST-LINE TREATMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Antineoplastic Agents</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VITRO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLON-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FLUOROURACIL</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49963</publishedID><Artikel>New Affinity Probe Targeting VEGF Receptors for Kinase Inhibitor Selectivity Profiling by Chemical Proteomics</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Proteome Research</Journal><ABSTr>Solid tumors are dependent for growth on nutrients and the supply of oxygen, which they often acquire via neoangiogenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factors and the corresponding receptors (VEGFRs) play central roles in this process, and consequently, the blockade of this pathway is one therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. A number of small molecules inhibiting VEGFR inhibitors have been developed for clinical use, and a comprehensive view of target selectivity is important to assess the therapeutic as well as risk potential of a drug molecule. Recent advances in mass spectrometry-based chemical proteomics allow analyses of drug-target interactions under close-to-physiological conditions, and in this study, we report on the design, synthesis, and application of a small molecule affinity probe as a tool for the selectivity profiling of VEGFR and other kinase inhibitors. The probe is capable of binding &gt;132 protein kinases, including angiokinases such as VEGFRs, PDGFRs, and c-KIT from lysates of cancer cell lines or human placenta tissue. Combining the new probe with Kinobeads in competitive binding assays, we were able to identify nanomolar off-targets of the VEGFR/PDGFR inhibitors pazopanib and axitinib. Because of its broad binding spectrum, the developed chemical tool can be generically used for the discovery of kinase inhibitor targets, which may contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of action of such drugs.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>13 (5), 2445-2452</Feld596><PubVol>13</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>2445</StrtPage><EndPage>2452</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ku X" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Heinzlmeir S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Helm D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Medard G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kuster B" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24712744</PMID><DOI>10.1021/pr401247t</DOI><KST>L701</KST><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANGIOGENESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH-FACTOR RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AURORA KINASES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DRUG DISCOVERY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>KINOME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHEMOPROTEOMICS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AXITINIB</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49964</publishedID><Artikel>An impedance-based cytotoxicity assay for real-time and label-free assessment of T-cell-mediated killing of adherent cells</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Immunological Methods</Journal><ABSTr>The in vitro assessment of T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity plays an important and increasingly relevant role both in preclinical target evaluation and during immunomonitoring to accompany clinical trials employing targeted immunotherapies. For a long time, the gold standard for this purpose has been the chromium release assay (CRA). This end point assay, however, shows several disadvantages including the inevitable use of radioactivity. Based on electrical impedance measurements (using the xCELLigence system), we have established a label-free assay, facilitating the real-time monitoring of T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The coculture of peptide-specific T-cell lines with peptide-loaded target cells reproducibly led to a decrease in impedance due to induced apoptosis and detachment of target cells. Comparing our results to the standard CRA assay, we could demonstrate that impedance-based measurements show comparable results after short incubation periods (6h) but outperform the CRA both in reproducibility and sensitivity after prolonged incubation (24h), enabling the detection of target cell lysis with an effector to target ratio as low as 0.05:1. The impedance-based assay represents a valuable and highly sensitive tool for label-free real-time high throughput analysis of T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>405 (), 192-198</Feld596><PubVol>405</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>192</StrtPage><EndPage>198</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Peper JK" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Schuster H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Loeffler MW" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schmid-Horch B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Rammensee HG" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Stevanovic S" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24486140</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.jim.2014.01.012</DOI><KST>L801</KST><KEYWORD>RELEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TARGET-CELLS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49965</publishedID><Artikel>Convergence of genes and cellular pathways dysregulated in autism spectrum disorders</Artikel><Journal>American Journal of Human Genetics</Journal><ABSTr>Rare copy-number variation (CNV) is an important source of risk for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).

Pathogenic CNVs, often showing variable expressivity, included rare de novo and inherited events at 36 loci, implicating ASD-associated genes (CHD2, HDAC4, and GDI1) previously linked to other neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as other genes such as SETD5, MIR137, and HDAC9. Consistent with hypothesized gender-specific modulators, females with ASD were more likely to have highly penetrant CNVs (p = 0.017) and were also overrepresented among subjects with fragile X syndrome protein targets (p = 0.02). Genes affected by de novo CNVs and/or loss-of-function single-nucleotide variants converged on networks related to neuronal signaling and development, synapse function, and chromatin

are indispensible for activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB, expression of cytokines and the CD95 ligand (CD95L/FasL). Here we show that activation-induced ROS generation is dependent on mitochondrial fission. Inhibition of dynamin related protein 1 (Drp1) results in reduced ROS levels and transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB leading to diminished proliferation and CD95L-dependent activation-induced cell death (AICD). Upon stimulation Drp1 is S-nitrosylated, which is required for oxidative signalling, AICD and cytokine production. In conclusion, we describe a novel signalling pathway that links TCR-induced nitric oxide release to mitochondrial fission and oxidative signalling.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>588 (9), 1749-1754</Feld596><PubVol>588</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>1749</StrtPage><EndPage>1754</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Roth D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Krammer PH" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Guelow K" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24681098</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.febslet.2014.03.029</DOI><KST>D030</KST><KEYWORD>S-NITROSYLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DRP1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECEPTOR STIMULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NITRIC-OXIDE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NF-KAPPA-B</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DEATH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REQUIRES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MORPHOLOGY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49967</publishedID><Artikel>Prostate cancer (PCa) risk variants and risk of fatal PCa in the National Cancer Institute Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium</Artikel><Journal>European Urology</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Screening and diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa) is hampered by an inability to predict who has the potential to develop fatal disease and who has indolent cancer. Studies have identified multiple genetic risk loci for PCa incidence, but it is unknown whether they could be used as biomarkers for PCa-specific mortality (PCSM). OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of 47 established PCa risk single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with PCSM. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We included 10 487 men who had PCa and 11 024 controls, with a median follow-up of 8.3 yr, during which 1053 PCa deaths occurred. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: The main outcome was PCSM. The risk allele was defined as the allele associated with an increased risk for PCa in the literature. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to calculate the hazard ratios of each SNP with time to progression to PCSM after diagnosis. We also used logistic regression to calculate odds ratios for each risk SNP, comparing fatal PCa cases to controls. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Among the cases, we found that 8 of the 47 SNPs were significantly associated (p&lt;0.05) with time to PCSM. The risk allele of rs11672691 (intergenic) was associated with an increased risk for PCSM, while 7 SNPs had risk alleles inversely associated (rs13385191 [C2orf43], rs17021918 [PDLIM5], rs10486567 [JAZF1], rs6465657 [LMTK2], rs7127900 (intergenic), rs2735839 [KLK3], rs10993994 [MSMB], rs13385191 [C2orf43]). In the case-control analysis, 22 SNPs were associated (p&lt;0.05) with the risk of fatal PCa, but most did not differentiate between fatal and nonfatal PCa. Rs11672691 and rs10993994 were associated with both fatal and nonfatal PCa, while rs6465657, rs7127900, rs2735839, and rs13385191 were associated with nonfatal PCa only. CONCLUSIONS: Eight established risk loci were associated with progression to PCSM after diagnosis. Twenty-two SNPs were associated with fatal PCa incidence, but most did not differentiate between fatal and nonfatal PCa. The relatively small magnitudes of the associations do not translate well into risk prediction, but these findings merit further follow-up, because they may yield important clues about the complex biology of fatal PCa. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this report, we assessed whether established PCa risk variants could predict PCSM. We found eight risk variants associated with PCSM: One predicted an increased risk of PCSM, while seven were associated with decreased risk. Larger studies that focus on fatal PCa are needed to identify more markers that could aid prediction.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>65 (6), 1069-1075</Feld596><PubVol>65</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>1069</StrtPage><EndPage>1075</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Shui IM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Lindstrom S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kibel AS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Berndt SI" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Campa D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Gerke T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Penney KL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Albanes D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Berg C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Chanock S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Crawford ED" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Diver WR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Gapstur SM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Gaziano JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Giles GG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Henderson B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Hoover R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Johansson M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Le Marchand L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Ma J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Navarro C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Schumacher FR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Severi G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Siddiq A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Stampfer M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Stevens VL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Travis RC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Trichopoulos D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Vineis P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Mucci LA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Yeager M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Giovannucci E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Kraft P" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24411283</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.eururo.2013.12.058</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>MEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DEATH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUSCEPTIBILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MORTALITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENETIC-VARIANTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LOCI</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>8Q24</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49968</publishedID><Artikel>Long noncoding RNA: "LNCs" to cancer</Artikel><Journal>European Urology</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>65 (6), 1152-1153</Feld596><PubVol>65</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>1152</StrtPage><EndPage>1153</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Sueltmann H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Diederichs S" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24508069</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.eururo.2014.01.032</DOI><KST>B150</KST><KST>B063</KST><KEYWORD>HUMAN-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>transcription</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METASTASIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROSTATE-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGRESSION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>49969</publishedID><Artikel>Oncology and Supply in Trade and Consumer media</Artikel><Journal>Onkologe</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>20 (5), 477-480</Feld596><PubVol>20</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>477</StrtPage><EndPage>480</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Gaisser,A."

Several studies have suggested a benefit of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) compared with 3D-conformal radiation (3D-CRT) regarding acute toxicity. This study evaluates outcome and toxicity of patients undergoing IMRT/Tomotherapy or 3D-CRT at our institution.

Methods: A cohort of 105 anal cancer patients was treated with chemoradiation or radiation alone (16.2%) between January 2000 and December 2011. 37 patients received 3D-CRT while 68 patients were treated with IMRT. Follow-up exams were performed every 3 to 6 months for a minimum of 3 years and then annually.

Results: Median follow-up was 41.4 months (2.8-158.4). Overall survival (OS), Progression-free survival (PFS) and local control (LC) at 3 years was 70.3%, 66.5%, 78.3% in the 3D-CRT group and 82.9%, 66.5%, 75.3% in the IMRT group without statistically significant difference. 3-year Colostomy-free survival (CFS) was 85.7% in the IMRT/Tomotherapy group and 91.8% in the 3D-CRT group (p = 0.48). No grade 4 toxicity was found in both groups. Severe (G2/3) acute skin toxicity (94.6% vs. 63.2%; p &lt; 0.001) and acute gastrointestinal toxicity rate (67.6% vs. 47.1%; p = 0.03) was significantly higher with 3D-CRT compared to IMRT/Tomotherapy.

Conclusion: The use of IMRT can reduce acute severe side effects of the skin and gastrointestinal tract but did not demonstrate improved results regarding OS, PFS, LC and CFS.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (1), 113-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>113</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Koerber,S."

Its key ingredient is the energy density functional.

Purpose: In this work, we propose a new parametrization UNEDF2 of the Skyrme energy density functional.

Methods: The functional optimization is carried out using the POUNDerS optimization algorithm within the framework of the Skyrme Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory. Compared to the previous parametrization UNEDF1, restrictions on the tensor term of the energy density have been lifted, yielding a very general form of the energy density functional up to second order in derivatives of the one-body density matrix. In order to impose constraints on all the parameters of the functional, selected data on single-particle splittings in spherical doubly-magic nuclei have been included into the experimental dataset.

Results: The agreement with both bulk and spectroscopic nuclear properties achieved by the resulting UNEDF2 parametrization is comparable with UNEDF1. While there is a small improvement on single-particle spectra and binding energies of closed shell nuclei, the reproduction of fission barriers and fission isomer excitation energies has degraded. As compared to previous UNEDF parametrizations, the parameter confidence interval for UNEDF2 is narrower. In particular, our results overlap well with those obtained in previous systematic studies of the spin-orbit and tensor terms.

Conclusions: UNEDF2 can be viewed as an all-around Skyrme EDF that performs reasonably well for both global nuclear properties and shell structure. However, after adding new data aiming to better constrain the nuclear functional, its quality has improved only marginally. These results suggest that the standard Skyrme energy density has reached its limits, and significant changes to the form of the functional are needed.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>89 (5), Art.

Mice lacking GluA1-containing AMPA receptors (GluA1(-/-) mice) were previously shown to exhibit impaired hippocampal place cell selectivity. Here we investigated whether path integration performance and the activity of grid cells of the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) are affected in these mice. We first tested GluA1(-/-) mice on a standard food-carrying homing task and found that they were impaired in processing idiothetic cues. To corroborate these findings, we developed an L-maze task that is less complex and is performed entirely in darkness, thereby reducing numerous confounding variables when testing path integration. Also in this task, the performance of GluA1(-/-) mice was impaired. Next, we performed in vivo recordings in the MEC of GluA1(-/-) mice. MEC neurons exhibited altered grid cell spatial periodicity and reduced spatial selectivity, whereas head direction tuning and speed modulation were not affected. The firing associations between pairs of neurons in GluA1(-/-) mice were stable, both in time and space, indicating that attractor states were still present despite the lack of grid periodicity. Together, these results support the hypothesis that spatial representations in the hippocampal-entorhinal network contribute to path integration.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>34 (18), 6245-6259</Feld596><PubVol>34</PubVol><PubIss>18</PubIss><StrtPage>6245</StrtPage><EndPage>6259</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Allen K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Gil M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Resnik E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Toader O" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Seeburg P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Monyer H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24790195</PMID><DOI>10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4330-13.2014</DOI><KST>A230</KST><KEYWORD>FIMBRIA-FORNIX LESIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REFERENCE MEMORY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THETA RHYTHM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PLACE CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENTORHINAL CORTEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MODEL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RAT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>hippocampus</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WORKING-MEMORY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>A-DEFICIENT MICE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50007</publishedID><Artikel>Infiltration patterns in monoclonal plasma cell disorders: correlation of magnetic resonance imaging with matched bone marrow histology</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Radiology</Journal><ABSTr>OBJECTIVES: To investigate how plasma cell infiltration patterns detected by MRI match the plasma cell distribution in bone marrow biopsy. METHODS: We assessed 50 patients with monoclonal plasma cell disorders of all clinical stages. MRI infiltration pattern was compared with matched BM histology from the same anatomic region. RESULTS: MRI revealed a minimal (n=11, 22%), focal (n=5, 10%), diffuse (n=14, 28%) and mixed (n=20, 40%) infiltration pattern. Diffuse MRI pattern was predominant in smoldering myeloma patients whereas the MRI patterns with "focal component" (i.e. focal and mixed) were most common in symptomatic myeloma (p&lt;0.01). In histology an interstitial (n=13, 26%), nodular (n=23, 46%) and packed marrow (n=14, 28%) was found respectively. All three histological types of infiltration were observed in patients with diffuse and mixed MRI patterns. Minimal MRI pattern was found in all MGUS patients and was associated with an interstitial BM infiltration. In two patients with minimal MRI pattern an extensive micro-nodular BM infiltration was found in histology. CONCLUSIONS: Infiltration patterns in MRI represent different histological growth patterns of plasma cells, but the MRI resolution is not sufficient to visualize micro-nodular aggregates of plasma cells.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>83 (6), 970-974</Feld596><PubVol>83</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>970</StrtPage><EndPage>974</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Andrulis M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Baeuerle T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Goldschmidt H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Delorme S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Landgren O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Schirmacher P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Hillengass J" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24725673</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.ejrad.2014.03.005</DOI><KST>E010</KST><KEYWORD>PROGNOSTIC-SIGNIFICANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MRI</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CLASSIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MULTIPLE-MYELOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WHOLE-BODY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>UNDETERMINED SIGNIFICANCE MGUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GAMMOPATHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SALMON</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DURIE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50013</publishedID><Artikel>Drosophila Spag is the homolog of RNA polymerase II-associated protein 3 (RPAP3) and recruits the heat shock proteins 70 and 90 (Hsp70 and Hsp90) during the assembly of cellular machineries</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Biological Chemistry</Journal><ABSTr>The R2TP is a recently identified Hsp90 co-chaperone, composed of four proteins as follows: Pih1D1, RPAP3, and the AAA(+)-ATPases RUVBL1 and RUVBL2. In mammals, the R2TP is involved in the biogenesis of cellular machineries such as RNA polymerases, small nucleolar ribonucleoparticles and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases. Here, we characterize the spaghetti (spag) gene of Drosophila, the homolog of human RPAP3. This gene plays an essential function during Drosophila development. We show that Spag protein binds Drosophila orthologs of R2TP components and Hsp90, like its yeast counterpart. Unexpectedly, Spag also interacts and stimulates the chaperone activity of Hsp70. Using null mutants and flies with inducible RNAi, we show that spaghetti is necessary for the stabilization of snoRNP core proteins and target of rapamycin activity and likely the assembly of RNA polymerase II. This work highlights the strong conservation of both the HSP90/R2TP system and its clients and further shows that Spag, unlike Saccharomyces cerevisiae Tah1, performs essential functions in metazoans. Interaction of Spag with both Hsp70 and Hsp90 suggests a model whereby R2TP would accompany clients from Hsp70 to Hsp90 to facilitate their assembly into macromolecular complexes.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>289 (9), 6236-6247</Feld596><PubVol>289</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>6236</StrtPage><EndPage>6247</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Benbahouche Nel H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Iliopoulos I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Torok I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Marhold J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Henri J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Kajava AV" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Farkas R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Kempf T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Schnoelzer M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Meyer P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Kiss I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Bertrand E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Mechler BM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Pradet-Balade B" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24394412</PMID><DOI>10.1074/jbc.M113.499608</DOI><KST>B100</KST><KEYWORD>HUMAN TRANSCRIPTION MACHINERY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>R2TP COMPLEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>2ND CHROMOSOME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMAGINAL DISCS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REACTION CYCLE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTERACTION NETWORK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BINDING-PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHAPERONE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MELANOGASTER</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50014</publishedID><Artikel>BRaf and MEK inhibitors differentially regulate cell fate and microenvironment in human hepatocellular carcinoma</Artikel><Journal>Clinical Cancer Research</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: Small molecule inhibitors of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, such as sorafenib, represent novel treatment options for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of our study was to identify downstream targets as biomarker candidates that are directly linked to the oncogenic MAPK pathway in hepatocellular carcinoma and correlate with inhibition of this pathway by multikinase inhibitors. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines and fresh tumor and tumor-free liver tissues from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma were incubated with different BRaf or MEK inhibitors and analyzed for kinase phosphorylation, proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and chemokine secretion. RESULTS: Hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines responded differentially to these inhibitors in a dose-dependent manner, even those targeting the same kinase. Sorafenib inhibited both MEK1 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation at high but increased signaling at low concentrations. Similarly, PLX4720 increased MEK/ERK signaling independently from mutations in BRaf or NRas. MEK inhibitors decreased ERK1/2 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner. These signaling characteristics correlated with inhibition of proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and chemokine secretion. Fresh tissues derived from patients diagnosed with primary hepatocellular carcinoma responded to these inhibitors with changes in their microenvironment following the patterns observed in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. CONCLUSIONS: Oncogenic signaling of the MAPK pathway influences hepatocellular carcinoma sensitivity to treatment with BRaf and MEK inhibitors about cell fate independently from mutations in BRaf and NRas. MAPK inhibitors have a strong impact on chemokine secretion as a consequence of interference with oncogenic signaling. Therefore, novel biomarker candidates associated with the hepatocellular carcinoma microenvironment may be developed for prediction and monitoring of treatment response to small molecule inhibitors.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>20 (9), 2410-2423</Feld596><PubVol>20</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>2410</StrtPage><EndPage>2423</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Breunig C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Mueller BJ" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Umansky L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Wahl K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Hoffmann K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Lehner F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Manns MP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Bantel H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Falk CS" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24573550</PMID><DOI>10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-1635</DOI><KST>B050</KST><KST>D015</KST><KEYWORD>EPITHELIAL-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN LIVER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>KINASE CASCADE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NF-KAPPA-B</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>tumor microenvironment</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHASE-II</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AZD6244 ARRY-142886</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RAF/MEK/ERK PATHWAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TARGETED THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RAF INHIBITOR</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50017</publishedID><Artikel>An inherited variant in the gene coding for vitamin D-binding protein and survival from cutaneous melanoma: a BioGenoMEL study</Artikel><Journal>Pigment Cell and Melanoma Research</Journal><ABSTr>An association between low serum vitamin D levels and poorer melanoma survival has been reported. We have studied inheritance of a polymorphism of the GC gene, rs2282679, coding for the vitamin D-binding protein, which is associated with lower serum levels of vitamin D, in a meta-analysis of 3137 melanoma patients. The aim was to investigate evidence for a causal relationship between vitamin D and outcome (Mendelian randomization). The variant was not associated with reduced overall survival (OS) in the UK cohort, per-allele hazard ratio (HR) for death 1.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93, 1.64). In the smaller cohorts, HR in OS analysis was 1.07 (95% CI 0.88, 1.3) and for all cohorts combined, HR for OS was 1.09 (95% CI 0.93, 1.29). There was evidence of increased melanoma-specific deaths in the seven cohorts for which these data were available. The lack of unequivocal findings despite the large sample size illustrates the difficulties of implementing Mendelian randomization.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>27 (2), 234-243</Feld596><PubVol>27</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>234</StrtPage><EndPage>243</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Davies JR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Field S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Randerson-Moor J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Harland M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kumar R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Anic GM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Nagore E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Hansson J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Hoiom V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Jonsson G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Gruis NA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Park JY" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Guan J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Sivaramakrishna Rachakonda P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="14" name="Wendt J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Pjanova D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Puig S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Schadendorf D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Okamoto I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Olsson H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Affleck P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Garcia-Casado Z" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Puig-Butille JA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Stratigos AJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Kodela E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Donina S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Sucker A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Hosen I" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="28" name="Egan KM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Barrett JH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="van Doorn R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Bishop DT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Newton-Bishop J" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24219834</PMID><DOI>10.1111/pcmr.12193</DOI><KST>C050</KST><KEYWORD>GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>25-HYDROXYVITAMIN D LEVELS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DETERMINANTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MORTALITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ISOFORMS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50018</publishedID><Artikel>Cell type specific interleukin-6 induced responses in tumor keratinocytes and stromal fibroblasts are essential for invasive growth</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is one of the major inflammatory interleukins that has been linked to cancer progression. In our model for human skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), IL-6 expression is strongly upregulated upon progression from benign tumors to highly malignant, metastasizing SCCs. We now demonstrate that IL-6 promotes malignant and invasive tumor growth in human skin SCCs by inducing cell type specific cytokine profiles in tumor keratinocytes and stromal fibroblasts, activating the latter towards a tumor associated fibroblast (TAF) phenotype. In three-dimensional organotypic cocultures in vitro invasive growth of IL-6 overexpressing tumor keratinocytes, is associated with increased expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-14 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2, and clearly depends on IL-6 activated fibroblasts. IL-6-induced secretion of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) in tumor keratinocytes and of hepatocyte growth factor in fibroblasts is crucial for regulating expression and activation of MMP-2. This functional role of IL-6 is confirmed in vivo. Here MMP-14 and MMP-2 expression occur exclusively in surface transplants of IL-6 overexpressing keratinocytes and fibroblasts are identified as important source of MMP-2. Our data indicate that tumor keratinocytes derived IL-6 activates stromal fibroblasts towards a TAF phenotype, promoting tumor invasion via enhanced expression and activation of MMP-2.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>135 (3), 551-562</Feld596><PubVol>135</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>551</StrtPage><EndPage>562</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Depner S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Lederle W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Gutschalk C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Linde N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Zajonz A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Mueller MM" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>23165423</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.27951</DOI><KST>A150</KST><KEYWORD>PROGRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROSTATE-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>microenvironment</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANGIOGENESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VITRO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>C-JUN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CARCINOMA-ASSOCIATED FIBROBLASTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SKIN CARCINOMA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50019</publishedID><Artikel>Detaching from the negative by reappraisal: the role of right superior frontal gyrus (BA9/32)

Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience 8, Art.Nr.: 264, 2014.</Artikel><Journal>Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience</Journal><ABSTr>The ability to reappraise the emotional impact of events is related to long-term mental health. Self-focused reappraisal (REAPPself), i.e., reducing the personal relevance of the negative events, has been previously associated with neural activity in regions near right medial prefrontal cortex, but rarely investigated among brain-damaged individuals. Thus, we aimed to examine the REAPPself ability of brain-damaged patients and healthy controls considering structural atrophies and gray matter intensities, respectively. Twenty patients with well-defined cortex lesions due to an acquired circumscribed tumor or cyst and 23 healthy controls performed a REAPPself task, in which they had to either observe negative stimuli or decrease emotional responding by REAPPself. Next, they rated the impact of negative arousal and valence. REAPPself ability scores were calculated by subtracting the negative picture ratings after applying REAPPself from the ratings of the observing condition. The scores of the patients were included in a voxel-based lesion-symptom mapping (VLSM) analysis to identify deficit related areas (ROI). Then, a ROI group-wise comparison was performed. Additionally, a whole-brain voxel-based-morphometry (VBM) analysis was run, in which healthy participant's REAPPself ability scores were correlated with gray matter intensities. Results showed that (1) regions in the right superior frontal gyrus (SFG), comprising the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA9) and the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (BA32), were associated with patient's impaired down-regulation of arousal, (2) a lesion in the depicted ROI occasioned significant REAPPself impairments, (3) REAPPself ability of controls was linked with increased gray matter intensities in the ROI regions. Our findings show for the first time that the neural integrity and the structural volume of right SFG regions (BA9/32) might be indispensable for REAPPself. Implications for neurofeedback research are discussed.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>8 (), Art. Nr.: 165-</Feld596><PubVol>8</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>Art.

The newly described germline and recurrent somatic mutations in melanoma and other cancers in the TERT promoter that create de novo E-twenty six/ternary complex factors (Ets/TCF) binding sites, provide an insight into the possible cause of tumor-specific increased TERT expression.

Using exome sequencing, they described 69 and 140 candidate cancer genes (CAN genes), respectively. We hypothesized that germline variants in these genes may influence CRC risk, similar to APC, which is causing CRC through germline and somatic mutations. METHODS: After excluding the well-established CRC genes APC, KRAS, TP53, and ABCA1, we analyzed 35 potentially functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 10 CAN genes (OBSCN, MLL3, PKHD1, SYNE1, ERCC6, FBXW7, EPHB6/TRPV6, ELAC1/SMAD4, EPHA3, and ADAMTSL3) using KBiosciences Competitive Allele-Specific PCR genotyping assays. In addition to CRC risk (1,399 CRC cases, 838 controls), we also considered the influence of the SNPs on patients' survival (406 cases). RESULTS: In spite of the fact that our in silico analyses suggested functional relevance for the studied genes and SNPs, our data did not support a strong influence of the studied germline variants on CRC risk and survival. The strongest association with CRC risk and survival was found for MLL3 (rs6464211, OR 1.50, p = 0.002, dominant model; HR 2.12, p = 0.020, recessive model). Two SNPs in EPHB6/TRPV6 (dominant model) showed marginal associations with survival (rs4987622 HR 0.58 p = 0.028 and rs6947538 HR 0.64, p = 0.036, respectively). CONCLUSION: Although somatic mutations in the CAN genes have been related to the development and progression of various types of cancers in several next-generation sequencing or expression analyses, our study suggests that the studied potentially functional germline variants are not likely to affect CRC risk or survival.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>25 (6), 759-769</Feld596><PubVol>25</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>759</StrtPage><EndPage>769</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Huhn S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Bevier M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Pardini B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Naccarati A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Vodickova L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Novotny J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Vodicka P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Hemminki K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Foersti A" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24706189</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s10552-014-0379-1</DOI><KST>C050</KST><KEYWORD>IDENTIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>genetics</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLON-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEREDITARY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>microsatellite instability</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>inactivation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONSERVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POSITIVE SELECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN BREAST</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50023</publishedID><Artikel>Cell competition is a tumour suppressor mechanism in the thymus</Artikel><Journal>Nature</Journal><ABSTr>Cell competition is an emerging principle underlying selection for cellular fitness during development and disease. Competition may be relevant for cancer, but an experimental link between defects in competition and tumorigenesis is elusive. In the thymus, T lymphocytes develop from precursors that are constantly replaced by bone-marrow-derived progenitors. Here we show that in mice this turnover is regulated by natural cell competition between 'young' bone-marrow-derived and 'old' thymus-resident progenitors that, although genetically identical, execute differential gene expression programs. Disruption of cell competition leads to progenitor self-renewal, upregulation of Hmga1, transformation, and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) resembling the human disease in pathology, genomic lesions, leukaemia-associated transcripts, and activating mutations in Notch1. Hence, cell competition is a tumour suppressor mechanism in the thymus. Failure to select fit progenitors through cell competition may explain leukaemia in X-linked severe combined immune deficiency patients who showed thymus-autonomous T-cell development after therapy with gene-corrected autologous progenitors.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>509 (7501), 465-470</Feld596><PubVol>509</PubVol><PubIss>7501</PubIss><StrtPage>465</StrtPage><EndPage>470</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Martins VC" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Busch K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Juraeva D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Blum C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Ludwig C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Rasche V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Lasitschka F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Mastitsky SE" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Brors B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Hielscher T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Fehling HJ" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Rodewald HR" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24828041</PMID><DOI>10.1038/nature13317</DOI><KST>B080</KST><KST>C060</KST><KST>D110</KST><KST>G200</KST><KEYWORD>C-KIT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOLECULAR PATHOGENESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECEPTOR-GAMMA CHAIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>T-ALL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEMATOPOIETIC STEM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>leukemogenesis</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSFORMATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC-LEUKEMIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NOTCH1 MUTATIONS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50024</publishedID><Artikel>Occupational solvent exposure and risk of meningioma: results from the INTEROCC multicentre case-control study</Artikel><Journal>Occupational and Environmental Medicine</Journal><ABSTr>OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between occupational exposure to selected organic solvents and meningioma. METHODOLOGY: A multicentre case-control study conducted in seven countries, including 1906 cases and 5565 controls. Occupational exposure to selected classes of organic solvents (aliphatic and alicyclic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons and 'other' organic solvents) or seven specific solvents (benzene, toluene, trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, 1,1,1-trichloroethylene, methylene chloride and gasoline) was assessed using lifetime occupational histories and a modified version of the FINJEM job-exposure matrix (INTEROCC-JEM). Study participants were classified as 'exposed' when they had worked in an occupation for at least 1 year, with a 5-year lag, in which the estimated prevalence of exposure was 25% or greater in the INTEROCC-JEM. Associations between meningioma and each of the solvent exposures were estimated using conditional logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: A total of 6.5% of study participants were ever exposed to 'any' solvent, with a somewhat greater proportion of controls (7%) ever exposed compared with cases (5%), but only one case was ever exposed to any chlorinated hydrocarbon (1,1,1-trichloroethane). No association was observed between any of the organic solvents and meningioma, in either men or women, and no dose-response relationships were observed in internal analyses using either exposure duration or cumulative exposure. DISCUSSION: We found no evidence that occupational exposure to these organic solvents is associated with meningioma.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>71 (4), 253-258</Feld596><PubVol>71</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>253</StrtPage><EndPage>258</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="McLean D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Fleming S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Turner MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kincl L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Richardson L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Benke G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Schlehofer B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Schlaefer K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Parent ME" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Hours M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Krewski D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="van Tongeren M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Sadetzki S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Siemiatycki J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Cardis E" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24474387</PMID><KST>C030</KST><KEYWORD>EPIDEMIOLOGY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CARCINOGENS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADULT BRAIN-TUMORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FARMERS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHEMICALS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLIOMAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MATRIX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHILDHOOD</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50025</publishedID><Artikel>Nuclear ARVCF protein binds splicing factors and contributes to the regulation of alternative splicing</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Biological Chemistry</Journal><ABSTr>The armadillo repeat protein ARVCF is a component of adherens junctions. Similar to related proteins, such as p120-catenin and beta-catenin, with known signaling functions, localization studies indicate a cytoplasmic and a nuclear pool of ARVCF. We find that ARVCF interacts with different proteins involved in mRNA-processing: the splicing factor SRSF1 (SF2/ASF), the RNA helicase p68 (DDX5), and the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein hnRNP H2. All three proteins bind to ARVCF in an RNA-independent manner. Furthermore, ARVCF occurs in large RNA-containing complexes that contain both spliced and unspliced mRNAs of housekeeping genes. By domain analysis, we show that interactions occur via the ARVCF C terminus. Overexpression of ARVCF, p68, SRSF1, and hnRNP H2 induces a significant increase in splicing activity of a reporter mRNA. Upon depletion of ARVCF followed by RNA sequence analysis, several alternatively spliced transcripts are significantly changed. Therefore, we conclude that nuclear ARVCF influences splicing of pre-mRNAs. We hypothesize that ARVCF is involved in alternative splicing, generating proteomic diversity, and its deregulation may contribute to diseased states, such as cancer and neurological disorders.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>289 (18), 12421-12434</Feld596><PubVol>289</PubVol><PubIss>18</PubIss><StrtPage>12421</StrtPage><EndPage>12434</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Rappe U" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Schlechter T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Aschoff M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Hotz-Wagenblatt A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Hofmann I" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24644279</PMID><DOI>10.1074/jbc.M113.530717</DOI><KST>A190</KST><KST>W180</KST><KEYWORD>CELL-CELL ADHESION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CATENIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIGHT-CHAINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CYTOPLASMIC PARTICLES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPITHELIAL-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PLAQUE PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MESSENGER-RNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPANDED CUG REPEATS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50026</publishedID><Artikel>A recurrent 11q aberration pattern characterizes a subset of MYC-negative high-grade B-cell lymphomas resembling Burkitt lymphoma</Artikel><Journal>Blood</Journal><ABSTr>The genetic hallmark of Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is the t(8;14)(q24;q32) and its variants leading to activation of the MYC oncogene. It is a matter of debate whether true BL without MYC translocation exists. Here, we identified 59 lymphomas concordantly called BL by 2 gene expression classifiers among 753 B-cell lymphomas. Only 2 (3%) of these 59 molecular BL lacked a MYC translocation, which both shared a peculiar pattern of chromosome 11q aberration characterized by interstitial gains including 11q23.2-q23.3 and telomeric losses of 11q24.1-qter. We extended our analysis to 17 MYC-negative high-grade B-cell lymphomas with a similar 11q aberration and showed this aberration to be recurrently associated with morphologic and clinical features of BL. The minimal region of gain was defined by high-level amplifications in 11q23.3 and associated with overexpression of genes including PAFAH1B2 on a transcriptional and protein level. The recurrent region of loss contained a focal homozygous deletion in 11q24.2-q24.3 including the ETS1 gene, which was shown to be mutated in 4 of 16 investigated cases. These findings indicate the existence of a molecularly distinct subset of B-cell lymphomas reminiscent of BL, which is characterized by deregulation of genes in 11q.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>123 (8), 1187-1198</Feld596><PubVol>123</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>1187</StrtPage><EndPage>1198</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Salaverria I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Martin-Guerrero I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Wagener R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kreuz M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kohler CW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Richter J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Pienkowska-Grela B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Adam P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Burkhardt B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Claviez A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Damm-Welk C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Drexler HG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Hummel M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Jaffe ES" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Kuppers R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Lefebvre C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Lisfeld J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Loffler M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Macleod RA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Nagel I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Oschlies I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Rosolowski M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Russell RB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Rymkiewicz G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Schindler D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Schlesner M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="26" name="Scholtysik R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Schwaenen C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Spang R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Szczepanowski M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Trumper L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Vater I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Wessendorf S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Klapper W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Siebert R" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24398325</PMID><DOI>10.1182/blood-2013-06-507996</DOI><KST>B080</KST><KEYWORD>FOLLICULAR LYMPHOMAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HYBRIDIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ABNORMALITIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHOGENESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DEREGULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NON-HODGKINS-LYMPHOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50027</publishedID><Artikel>Plasma polychlorinated biphenyl concentrations and immune function in postmenopausal women</Artikel><Journal>Environmental Research</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposure has been associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in several studies, and the immune system is a potential mediator. OBJECTIVES: We analyzed associations of plasma PCBs with immune function measures. We hypothesized that higher plasma PCB concentrations are associated with lower immune function cross-sectionally, and that increases in PCB concentrations over a one year period are associated with decreases in immune function. METHODS: Plasma PCB concentrations and immune function [natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity and PHA-induced T-lymphocyte proliferation (PHA-TLP)] were measured at baseline and one year in 109 postmenopausal overweight women participating in an exercise intervention study in the Seattle, Washington (USA) area. Mixed models, with adjustment for body mass index and other potential confounders, were used to estimate associations of PCBs with immune function cross-sectionally and longitudinally. RESULTS: Associations of PCBs with immune function measures differed across groups of PCBs (e.g., medium- and high-chlorinated and dioxin-like [mono-ortho-substituted]) and by the time frame for the comparison (cross-sectional vs. longitudinal). Higher concentrations of medium- and high-chlorinated PCBs were associated with higher PHA-TLP cross-sectionally but not longitudinally. The mean decrease in 0.5 microg/mL PHA-TLP/50.0 pmol/g-lipid increase in dioxin-like PCBs over one year was 51.6 (95% confidence interval 2.7, 100.5; P=0.039). There was no association between plasma PCBs and NK cytotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: These results do not provide strong evidence of impaired cellular immunity from PCB exposure. Larger longitudinal studies with greater variability in PCB exposures are needed to further examine temporal associations of PCBs with immune function.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>131 (), 174-180</Feld596><PubVol>131</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>174</StrtPage><EndPage>180</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Spector JT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="De Roos AJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Ulrich CM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Sheppard L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Sjodin A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Wener MH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Wood B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="McTiernan A" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24721136</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.envres.2014.03.011</DOI><KST>G110</KST><KEYWORD>ADIPOSE-TISSUE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONTROLLED-TRIAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NON-HODGKIN-LYMPHOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PERIPHERAL-BLOOD</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VITRO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>KILLER-CELL CYTOTOXICITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ORGANOCHLORINE LEVELS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN HEALTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SEAL PUPS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50028</publishedID><Artikel>Axonal guidance signaling pathway interacting with smoking in modifying the risk of pancreatic cancer: a gene- and pathway-based interaction analysis of GWAS data</Artikel><Journal>Carcinogenesis</Journal><ABSTr>We conducted gene-smoking interaction analysis in GWAS data of pancreati cancer. We found a possible interaction of axon guidance pathway genes with smoking in modifying the risk of pancreatic cancer. Once confirmed, it will open a new avenue to unveiling the etiology of smoking-associated pancreatic cancer.Cigarette smoking is the best established modifiable risk factor for pancreatic cancer. Genetic factors that underlie smoking-related pancreatic cancer have previously not been examined at the genome-wide level. Taking advantage of the existing Genome-wide association study (GWAS) genotype and risk factor data from the Pancreatic Cancer Case Control Consortium, we conducted a discovery study in 2028 cases and 2109 controls to examine gene-smoking interactions at pathway/gene/single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) level. Using the likelihood ratio test nested in logistic regression models and ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA), we examined 172 KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways, 3 manually curated gene sets, 3 nicotine dependency gene ontology pathways, 17 912 genes and 468 114 SNPs. None of the individual pathway/gene/SNP showed significant interaction with smoking after adjusting for multiple comparisons. Six KEGG pathways showed nominal interactions (P &lt; 0.05) with smoking, and the top two are the pancreatic secretion and salivary secretion pathways (major contributing genes: RAB8A, PLCB and CTRB1). Nine genes, i.e. ZBED2, EXO1, PSG2, SLC36A1, CLSTN1, MTHFSD, FAT2, IL10RB and ATXN2 had P (interaction) &lt; 0.0005. Five intergenic region SNPs and two SNPs of the EVC and KCNIP4 genes had P (interaction) &lt; 0.00003(.) In IPA analysis of genes with nominal interactions with smoking, axonal guidance signaling genes were significantly overrepresented canonical pathways. Genes contributing to the axon guidance signaling pathway included the SLIT/ROBO signaling genes that were frequently altered in pancreatic cancer. These observations need to be confirmed in additional data set.

Repetitive elements are hotspots for recombination and represent a serious challenge for genome integrity. Maintaining these repeated elements in a compact heterochromatic structure suppresses recombination and unwanted mutagenic transposition, and is therefore indispensable for genomic stability. Paradoxically, repetitive elements are not transcriptionally inert, but produce RNA that has important functions in regulating and reinforcing the heterochromatic state. Here, we review the role of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) in recruiting chromatin-modifying enzymes to repetitive genomic loci to establish a repressive chromatin structure that safeguards chromosome integrity and genome stability.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (1), 53-61</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>53</StrtPage><EndPage>61</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Bierhoff H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Postepska-Igielska A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Grummt I" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24121539</PMID><KST>A030</KST><KEYWORD>HISTONE METHYLTRANSFERASES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REPEAT-CONTAINING RNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BINDING PROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>epigenetic regulation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REMODELING COMPLEX NORC</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MAMMALIAN-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PERICENTRIC HETEROCHROMATIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RIBOSOMAL GENE-TRANSCRIPTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA methylation</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50032</publishedID><Artikel>Tracking protein turnover and degradation by microscopy: photo-switchable versus time-encoded fluorescent proteins</Artikel><Journal>Open Biology</Journal><ABSTr>Expanded fluorescent protein techniques employing photo-switchable and fluorescent timer proteins have become important tools in biological research.

For the proper circadian gene expression, dynamic changes in chromatin structure are important. Although chromatin modifiers have been shown to play a role in circadian gene expression, the in vivo role of circadian signal-modulated chromatin modifiers at an organism level remains to be elucidated. Here, we provide evidence that the lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is phosphorylated by protein kinase C alpha (PKC alpha) in a circadian manner and the phosphorylated LSD1 forms a complex with CLOCK:BMAL1 to facilitate E-box-mediated transcriptional activation. Knockin mice bearing phosphorylation-defective Lsd1(SA/SA) alleles exhibited altered circadian rhythms in locomotor behavior with attenuation of rhythmic expression of core clock genes and impaired phase resetting of circadian clock. These data demonstrate that LSD1 is a key component of the molecular circadian oscillator, which plays a pivotal role in rhythmicity and phase resetting of the circadian clock.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>53 (5), 791-805</Feld596><PubVol>53</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>791</StrtPage><EndPage>805</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Nam HJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Boo K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kim D1" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Han DH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Choe HK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Kim CR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Sun W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Kim H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Kim K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Lee H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Metzger E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Schuele R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Yoo SH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Takahashi JS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Cho S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Son GH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Baek SH" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24582500</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.molcel.2014.01.028</DOI><KST>L601</KST><KEYWORD>LYSINE DEMETHYLASE LSD1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MPER2</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STRUCTURAL BASIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CLOCK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOUSE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NUCLEUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DEGRADATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>transcription</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50131</publishedID><Artikel>Plasma DNA integrity as a biomarker for primary and metastatic breast cancer and potential marker for early diagnosis</Artikel><Journal>Breast Cancer Research and Treatment</Journal><ABSTr>Circulating or cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has been evaluated as a biomarker in many cancers including breast cancer. In particular, integrity of cfDNA has been shown to be altered in cancers. We have estimated the biomarker potential of cfDNA in primary (PBC) and metastatic breast cancer (MBC). cfDNA integrity (cfDI) and concentration were determined in plasma of 383 individuals, including 82 PBC and 201 MBC cases, as well as 100 healthy controls, by measuring ALU and LINE1 repetitive DNA elements using quantitative PCR. The MBC patient group was further sub-divided into patients with detectable circulating tumour cells (CTCpos-MBC, n = 100) and those without (CTCneg-MBC, n = 101). A hierarchical decrease in cfDI and increase in cfDNA concentration from healthy controls to PBC and further onto MBC patients were observed. Investigation of cfDNA in media of cell lines was in concordance with these results. Combination of cfDI and cfDNA concentration could differentiate PBC cases from controls (area under the curve, AUC = 0.75), MBC cases from controls (AUC = 0.81 for CTCneg-MBC, AUC = 0.93 for CTCpos-MBC), and CTCneg-MBC from CTCpos-MBC cases (AUC = 0.83). cfDI additionally demonstrated a positive correlation to progression-free (HR of 0.46 for ALU, P = 0.0025) and overall survival (HR of 0.15 for ALU and 0.20 for LINE1, P &lt; 0.0001) in MBC, and had lower prediction error than CTC status. Our findings show that reduced cfDI and increased cfDNA concentration can serve as diagnostic markers for PBC and MBC, and cfDI as a prognostic marker for MBC, thereby making them attractive candidates for blood-based multi-marker assays.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>146 (1), 163-174</Feld596><PubVol>146</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>163</StrtPage><EndPage>174</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Madhavan,D."

We assessed 41 common non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) for which evidence of association with breast cancer risk had been previously reported. Case-control data were combined from 38 studies of white European women (46,450 cases and 42,600 controls) and analysed using unconditional logistic regression. Strong evidence of association was observed for three nsSNPs: ATXN7-K264R at 3p21 (rs1053338, per-allele OR=1.07, 95%CI=1.04-1.10, P=2.9x10-6), AKAP9-M463I at 7q21 (rs6964587, OR=1.05, 95%CI=1.03-1.07, P=1.7x10-6) and NEK10-L513S at 3p24 (rs10510592, OR=1.10, 95%CI=1.07-1.12, P=5.1x10-17). The first two associations reached genome-wide statistical significance in a combined analysis of available data, including independent data from nine GWAS: for ATXN7-K264R, OR=1.07 (95%CI=1.05-1.10, P=1.0x10-8); for AKAP9-M463I, OR=1.05 (95%CI=1.04-1.07, P=2.0x10-10). Further analysis of other common variants in these two regions suggested that intronic SNPs nearby are more strongly associated with disease risk. We have thus identified a novel susceptibility locus at 3p21, and confirmed previous suggestive evidence that rs6964587 at 7q21 is associated with risk. The third locus, rs10510592, is located in an established breast cancer susceptibility region; the association was substantially attenuated after adjustment for the known genome-wide association study (GWAS) hit. Thus, each of the associated nsSNPs is likely to be a marker for another, non-coding, variant causally related to breast cancer risk. Further fine-mapping and functional studies are required to identify the underlying risk-modifying variants and the genes through which they act.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (22),

variants in the glutathione S-transferase genes and survival in coloretal cancer patients after chemotherapy and differences according to treatment with oxaliplatin</Artikel><Journal>Pharmacogenetics and Genomics</Journal><ABSTr>IntroductionThe glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzymes are involved in the detoxification of a range of carcinogenic compounds as well as chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore, genetic variants in the GST genes could influence survival in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Results from previous studies have been inconsistent and therefore we investigated the association between the GSTP1 ile105val polymorphism and the copy number variants of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes and survival in CRC patients treated with adjuvant/palliative chemotherapy.Patients and methodsWe included 755 CRC patients with stage II-IV disease from two population-based studies carried out in Germany. Genotyping of the GSTP1 polymorphism was carried out using fluorescence-based melting curve analysis and copy number variants were determined using a multiplex PCR. Survival analysis was carried out using the Cox regression model, adjusting for age, sex, UICC stage, cancer site, and radiation therapy.ResultsCompared with noncarriers, CRC patients who were homozygote carriers of GSTM1 had significantly poorer survival after treatment with oxaliplatin [hazard ratio (HR) 2.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93-5.44] than those not treated with oxaliplatin (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.30-1.34; P for heterogeneity=0.031). The association was significant in metastatic CRC patients treated with oxaliplatin (HR 3.59, 95% CI 1.29-10.03). Neither the GSTP1 105val allele nor the GSTT1 deletion was significantly associated with CRC survival.ConclusionOur data suggest that GSTM1 may be a predictive marker for oxaliplatin therapy; however, independent large studies are warranted to confirm these results.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>24 (7), 340-347</Feld596><PubVol>24</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>340</StrtPage><EndPage>347</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kap EJ" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Richter S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Rudolph A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Jansen L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Ulrich A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hoffmeister M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Ulrich CM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Chang-Claude J" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24842074</PMID><DOI>10.1097/FPC.0000000000000059</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KST>C070</KST><KST>G110</KST><KEYWORD>POPULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TIME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POLYMORPHISMS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>pharmacology</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>QUALITY-OF-LIFE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PI EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MU</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50250</publishedID><Artikel>Development of ClearPEM-Sonic, a multimodal mammography system for PET and Ultrasound</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Instrumentation</Journal><ABSTr>ClearPEM-Sonic is an innovative imaging device specifically developed for breast cancer.

One of the used approaches for identifying perspective candidates is based on ethnopharmacology. Curcumin is the yellow pigment of curry and has being employed in traditional Indian medicine. Within the EU it has the status of food ingredient (E100) and remains in many food additives. It is isolated from Curcuma longa L. and has been reported as NF-kappa B inhibitor and apoptosis inducer with antioxidant, cholesterol lowering, anti-inflammatory, anti-parasitic, antibacterial and antitumor potential. Curcumin has been shown to exert a wide spectrum of pleiotropic activities including antitumor effects and protection of the normal bone marrow. It possesses antineoplastic activity in various malignant cell lines in vitro, such as cutaneous T cell lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia and urinary bladder cancer cells. In lymphoma and leukemia cell lines curcumin induces apoptosis as evidenced by caspase activation, PARP cleavage and oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Expression of the myeloid marker CD13 (aminopeptidase N) is associated with faster apoptosis induction. In addition, curcumin causes concentration-dependent glutathione level increase. Application of curcumin in vivo resulted in protection against cisplatin-induced chromosomal aberrations (anticlastogenic effect). This finding reveals curcumin as preferable partner for combinations with antineoplastic agents in order to potentiate their activity and ameliorate the adverse effects. There is a clear need for new curcumin formulations because of its low bioavailability after oral intake. Cutaneous and intravesical curcumin applications remain a possibility for successful clinical use of curcumin.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>13 (2), 459-469</Feld596><PubVol>13</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>459</StrtPage><EndPage>469</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ilieva,Y."

We employed plastic and fluorescent nuclear track detectors (PNTDs and FNTDs) in the entrance channel of a monoenergetic carbon ion beam covering the therapeutic energy range from 80 to 425 MeV/u. About 99% of all primary particle tracks detected by both detectors were successfully matched, while 1% of the particles were only detected by the FNTDs because of their superior spatial resolution. We conclude that both PNTDs and FNTDs are suitable for clinical carbon beam dosimetry with a detection efficiency of at least 98.82% and 99.83% respectively, if irradiations are performed with low fluence in the entrance channel of the ion beam. The investigated method can be adapted to other nuclear track detectors and offers the possibility to characterize new track detector materials against well-known detectors. Further, by combining two detectors with a restricted working range in the presented way a hybrid-detector system can be created with an extended and optimized working range.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (), Art.

Recently, the Kruppel-type zinc-finger transcription factor ZNF281 has been characterized as an EMT-inducing transcription factor (EMT-TF). Expression of ZNF281 is induced by the EMT-TF SNAIL and inhibited by the tumor suppressive microRNA miR-34a, which mediates repression of ZNF281 by the p53 tumor suppressor. Therefore, SNAIL, miR-34a and ZNF281 form a feed-forward regulatory loop, which controls EMT. Deregulation of this circuitry by mutational and epigenetic alterations in the p53/miR-34a axis promotes colorectal cancer (CRC) progression and metastasis formation. As ZNF281 physically interacts with the transcription factors NANOG, OCT4, SOX2, and c-MYC, it has been implicated in the regulation of pluripotency, stemness, and cancer. Accordingly, ectopic ZNF281 expression in CRC lines induces the stemness markers LGR5 and CD133 and promotes sphere formation, suggesting that the elevated expression of ZNF281 detected in cancer may enhance tumor stem cell formation and/or function. Here, we review the functional and organismal studies of ZNF281/ZBP-99 and its close relative ZBP-89/ZFP148 reported so far. Taken together, ZNF281 related biology has the potential to be translated into cancer diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic approaches.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>92 (6), 571-581</Feld596><PubVol>92</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>571</StrtPage><EndPage>581</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hahn S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Hermeking H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24838609</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00109-014-1160-3</DOI><KST>L701</KST></row><row><publishedID>50256</publishedID><Artikel>Epigenetic regulation by heritable RNA</Artikel><Journal>PloS Genetics</Journal><ABSTr>Genomic concepts are based on the assumption that phenotypes arise from the expression of genetic variants. However, the presence of non-Mendelian inheritance patterns provides a direct challenge to this view and suggests an important role for alternative mechanisms of gene regulation and inheritance. Over the past few years, a highly complex and diverse network of noncoding RNAs has been discovered. Research in animal models has shown that RNAs can be inherited and that RNA methyltransferases can be important for the transmission and expression of modified phenotypes in the next generation. We discuss possible mechanisms of RNA-mediated inheritance and the role of these mechanisms for human health and disease.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>10 (4), e1004296-</Feld596><PubVol>10</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>e1004296</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Liebers R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Rassoulzadegan M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Lyko F" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24743450</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pgen.1004296</DOI><KST>A130</KST><KEYWORD>MAMMALIAN DEVELOPMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>noncoding RNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENDOGENOUS SIRNAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA methylation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECESSIVE INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NON-MENDELIAN INHERITANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUNGER WINTER FAMILIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SLOW GROWTH PERIOD</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NUCLEOTIDE RESOLUTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ZYGOTIC TRANSITION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50260</publishedID><Artikel>Mitotic wnt signaling promotes protein stabilization and regulates cell size</Artikel><Journal>Molecular Cell</Journal><ABSTr>Canonical Wnt signaling is thought to regulate cell behavior mainly by inducing beta-catenin-dependent transcription of target genes. In proliferating cells Wnt signaling peaks in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, but the significance of this "mitotic Wnt signaling" is unclear. Here we introduce Wnt-dependent stabilization of proteins (Wnt/STOP), which is independent of beta-catenin and peaks during mitosis. We show that Wnt/STOP plays a critical role in protecting proteins, including c-MYC, from GSK3-dependent polyubiquitination and degradation. Wnt/STOP signaling increases cellular protein levels and cell size. Wnt/STOP, rather than beta-catenin signaling, is the dominant mode of Wnt signaling in several cancer cell lines, where it is required for cell growth. We propose that Wnt/STOP signaling slows down protein degradation as cells prepare to divide.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>54 (4), 663-674</Feld596><PubVol>54</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>663</StrtPage><EndPage>674</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Acebron SP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Karaulanov E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Berger BS" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Huang YL" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Niehrs C" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24837680</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.molcel.2014.04.014</DOI><KST>A050</KST><KEYWORD>STEM-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>beta-catenin</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CYCLE CONTROL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>C-MYC</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHOSPHORYLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHWAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECEPTOR ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLYCOGEN-SYNTHASE KINASE-3</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50261</publishedID><Artikel>Quiescence-Induced LncRNAs Trigger H4K20 Trimethylation and Transcriptional Silencing</Artikel><Journal>Molecular Cell</Journal><ABSTr>A complex network of regulatory pathways links transcription to cell growth and proliferation. Here we show that cellular quiescence alters chromatin structure by promoting trimethylation of histone H4 at lysine 20 (H4K20me3). In contrast to pericentric or telomeric regions, recruitment of the H4K20 methyltransferase Suv4-20h2 to rRNA genes and IAP elements requires neither trimethylation of H3K9 nor interaction with HP1 proteins but depends on long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that interact with Suv4-20h2. Growth factor deprivation and terminal differentiation lead to upregulation of these lncRNAs, increase in H4K20me3, and chromatin compaction. The results uncover a lncRNA-mediated mechanism that guides Suv4-20h2 to specific genomic loci to establish a more compact chromatin structure in growth-arrested cells.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>54 (4), 675-682</Feld596><PubVol>54</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>675</StrtPage><EndPage>682</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Bierhoff H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Dammert MA" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Brocks D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Dambacher S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schotta G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Grummt I" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24768537</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.molcel.2014.03.032</DOI><KST>A030</KST><KEYWORD>NUCLEOSOME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RIBOSOMAL-RNA GENES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LANDSCAPE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>chromatin compaction</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIFFERENTIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HETEROCHROMATIN FORMATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECRUITMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ELEMENTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>L1 RETROTRANSPOSITION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50262</publishedID><Artikel>Chromatin landscapes of retroviral and transposon integration profiles</Artikel><Journal>PloS Genetics</Journal><ABSTr>The ability of retroviruses and transposons to insert their genetic material into host DNA makes them widely used tools in molecular biology, cancer research and gene therapy. However, these systems have biases that may strongly affect research outcomes. To address this issue, we generated very large datasets consisting of similar to 120000 to similar to 180000 unselected integrations in the mouse genome for the Sleeping Beauty (SB) and piggyBac (PB) transposons, and the Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV). We analyzed similar to 80 (epi) genomic features to generate bias maps at both local and genome-wide scales. MMTV showed a remarkably uniform distribution of integrations across the genome. More distinct preferences were observed for the two transposons, with PB showing remarkable resemblance to bias profiles of the Murine Leukemia Virus. Furthermore, we present a model where target site selection is directed at multiple scales. At a large scale, target site selection is similar across systems, and defined by domain-oriented features, namely expression of proximal genes, proximity to CpG islands and to genic features, chromatin compaction and replication timing. Notable differences between the systems are mainly observed at smaller scales, and are directed by a diverse range of features. To study the effect of these biases on integration sites occupied under selective pressure, we turned to insertional mutagenesis (IM) screens. In IM screens, putative cancer genes are identified by finding frequently targeted genomic regions, or Common Integration Sites (CISs). Within three recently completed IM screens, we identified 7%-33% putative false positive CISs, which are likely not the result of the oncogenic selection process. Moreover, results indicate that PB, compared to SB, is more suited to tag oncogenes.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>10 (4), e1004250-</Feld596><PubVol>10</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>e1004250</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="de Jong J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Akhtar W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Badhai J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Rust AG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Rad R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hilkens J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Berns A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="van Lohuizen M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Wessels LF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="de Ridder J" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24721906</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pgen.1004250</DOI><KST>L701</KST><KEYWORD>CANCER GENE DISCOVERY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SLEEPING-BEAUTY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA methylation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SIGNALING PATHWAYS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN GENOME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IDENTIFIES GENES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>common insertion sites</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSCRIPTIONAL NETWORK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LENTIVIRAL VECTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EMBRYONIC STEM-CELLS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50263</publishedID><Artikel>Generation of "LYmph Node Derived Antibody Libraries" (LYNDAL) for selecting fully human antibody fragments with therapeutic potential</Artikel><Journal>mAbs</Journal><ABSTr>The development of efficient strategies for generating fully human monoclonal antibodies with unique functional properties that are exploitable for tailored therapeutic interventions remains a major challenge in the antibody technology field. Here, we present a methodology for recovering such antibodies from antigen-encountered human B cell repertoires. As the source for variable antibody genes, we cloned immunoglobulin G (IgG)-derived B cell repertoires from lymph nodes of 20 individuals undergoing surgery for head and neck cancer. Sequence analysis of unselected "LYmph Node Derived Antibody Libraries" (LYNDAL) revealed a naturally occurring distribution pattern of rearranged antibody sequences, representing all known variable gene families and most functional germline sequences. To demonstrate the feasibility for selecting antibodies with therapeutic potential from these repertoires, seven LYNDAL from donors with high serum titers against herpes simplex virus (HSV) were panned on recombinant glycoprotein B of HSV-1. Screening for specific binders delivered 34 single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) with unique sequences. Sequence analysis revealed extensive somatic hypermutation of enriched clones as a result of affinity maturation. Binding of scFvs to common glycoprotein B variants from HSV-1 and HSV-2 strains was highly specific, and the majority of analyzed antibody fragments bound to the target antigen with nanomolar affinity. From eight scFvs with HSV-neutralizing capacity in vitro, the most potent antibody neutralized 50% HSV-2 at 4.5 nM as a dimeric (scFv) 2. We anticipate our approach to be useful for recovering fully human antibodies with therapeutic potential.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>6 (1), 130-142</Feld596><PubVol>6</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>130</StrtPage><EndPage>142</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Diebolder P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Keller A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Haase S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schlegelmilch A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kiefer JD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Karimi T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Weber T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Moldenhauer G" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Kehm R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Eis-Hubinger AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Jaeger D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Federspil PA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Herold-Mende C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Dyckhoff G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Kontermann RE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Arndt MA" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="16" name="Krauss J" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24256717</PMID><DOI>10.4161/mabs.27236</DOI><KST>V964</KST><KST>D120</KST><KEYWORD>COMBINATORIAL LIBRARIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMMUNE-RESPONSE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>UMAN MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MEMORY B-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHAGE-DISPLAY LIBRARY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AFFINITY HUMAN-ANTIBODIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VIRUS NEUTRALIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FILAMENTOUS PHAGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GERMINAL-CENTERS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE LIBRARIES</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50264</publishedID><Artikel>Coffee and tea consumption, genotype-based CYP1A2 and NAT2 activity and colorectal cancer risk-results from the EPIC cohort study</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Coffee and tea contain numerous antimutagenic and antioxidant components and high levels of caffeine that may protect against colorectal cancer (CRC). We investigated the association between coffee and tea consumption and CRC risk and studied potential effect modification by CYP1A2 and NAT2 genotypes, enzymes involved in the metabolization of caffeine. Data from 477,071 participants (70.2% female) of the European Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort study were analyzed. At baseline (1992-2000) habitual (total, caffeinated and decaffeinated) coffee and tea consumption was assessed with dietary questionnaires. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratio's (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Potential effect modification by genotype-based CYP1A2 and NAT2 activity was studied in a nested case-control set of 1,252 cases and 2,175 controls. After a median follow-up of 11.6 years, 4,234 participants developed CRC (mean age 64.7 +/- 8.3 years). Total coffee consumption (high vs. non/low) was not associated with CRC risk (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.95-1.18) or subsite cancers, and no significant associations were found for caffeinated (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.97-1.26) and decaffeinated coffee (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.84-1.11) and tea (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.86-1.09). High coffee and tea consuming subjects with slow CYP1A2 or NAT2 activity had a similar CRC risk compared to non/low coffee and tea consuming subjects with a fast CYP1A2 or NAT2 activity, which suggests that caffeine metabolism does not affect the link between coffee and tea consumption and CRC risk. This study shows that coffee and tea consumption is not likely to be associated with overall CRC.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>135 (2), 401-412</Feld596><PubVol>135</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>401</StrtPage><EndPage>412</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Dik VK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Van Oijen MG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Siersema PD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Uiterwaal CS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Van Gils CH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Van Duijnhoven FJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Cauchi S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Yengo L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Froguel P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Bech BH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Olsen A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Boutron-Ruault MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Racine A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Fagherazzi G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Kuehn T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="18" name="Campa D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="19" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Aleksandrova K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Peppa E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Oikonomou E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Palli D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Grioni S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Vineis P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Panico S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Peeters PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Engeset D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Braaten T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Dorronsoro M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Chirlaque MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Sanchez MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Barricarte A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Zamora-Ros R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Arguelles M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Jirstrom K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Wallstrom P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Nilsson LM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Ljuslinder I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Travis RC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="44" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="45" name="Wareham N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="46" name="Freisling H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="47" name="Licaj I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="48" name="Jenab M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="49" name="Gunter MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="50" name="Murphy N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="51" name="Romaguera-Bosch D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="52" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24318358</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28655</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>COLONIC ABERRANT CRYPTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMPONENTS KAHWEOL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CAFESTOL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POLYPHENOLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GREEN TEA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEALTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RAT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>caffeine</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BLACK TEA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50265</publishedID><Artikel>Serum antibodies and DNA indicate a high prevalence of equine papillomavirus 2 (EcPV2) among horses in Switzerland</Artikel><Journal>Veterinary Dermatology</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: The DNA of equine papillomavirus type 2 (EcPV2) is consistently found in equine papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas, indicating a causal association of EcPV2 in the pathogenesis of these tumours; however, little is known about the prevalence of this virus. HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the geno- and seroprevalence of EcPV2 in clinically healthy horses in Switzerland. ANIMALS: Fifty horses presented to the equine department of the university clinic, displaying no skin or mucous membrane lesions or severe signs of other diseases, were sampled. METHODS: Cytobrush samples from the penis or vulva and serum samples were collected. To determine the genoprevalence of EcPV2, DNA was extracted from cytobrush samples and tested for viral DNA with a PCR assay amplifying a 338 bp fragment of the E7/E1 region of the viral genome. Seroprevalence was tested using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay aimed to detect antibodies against the major capsid protein (L1) of EcPV2. RESULTS: In five of 50 horses (10%), EcPV2-specific DNA was amplified but no antibodies could be detected, whereas in 14 of 50 horses (28%), antibodies against EcPV2 but no DNA were demonstrated. Both antibodies and viral DNA were detected in four of 50 horses (8%). Neither antibodies nor viral DNA were found in 27 of 50 horses (54%). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The seroprevalence suggests that EcPV2 is prevalent in the Swiss equine population, while the genoprevalence indicates that currently ongoing infections are less common. The discrepancy between geno- and seroprevalence probably indicates different stages of infection in the tested cohort.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>25 (3), 210-e54</Feld596><PubVol>25</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>210</StrtPage><EndPage>e54</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Fischer NM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Favrot C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Birkmann K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Jackson M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schwarzwald CC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Mueller M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Tobler K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Geisseler M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Lange CE" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24840327</PMID><DOI>10.1111/vde.12129</DOI><KST>F035</KST><KEYWORD>MUCOSA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>glutathione-S-transferase</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ELISA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SEQUENCES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BOVINE PAPILLOMAVIRUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-SITU</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SQUAMOUS-CELL CARCINOMAS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50266</publishedID><Artikel>Mineralocorticoid receptor function in bone metabolism and its role in glucocorticoid-induced osteopenia</Artikel><Journal>Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications</Journal><ABSTr>Although the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is expressed in osteoblasts and osteocytes and frequently co-localizes with the glucocorticoid receptors (GR), its pathophysiological functions in bone remain elusive.

Thus, MR may be involved in the deleterious effects of glucocorticoid excess on cortical bone.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>447 (3), 407-412</Feld596><PubVol>447</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>407</StrtPage><EndPage>412</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Fumoto T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Ishii KA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Ito M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Berger S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schuetz G" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Ikeda K" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24713303</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.03.149</DOI><KST>A992</KST><KEYWORD>PATHOGENESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>mechanisms</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>UPDATE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STRENGTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>microstructure</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>11-BETA-HYDROXYSTEROID DEHYDROGENASE TYPE-1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>osteocytes</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OSTEOBLASTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INDUCED OSTEOPOROSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALDOSTERONISM</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50267</publishedID><Artikel>Gene-environment interaction involving recently identified colorectal cancer susceptibility loci</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers and Prevention</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (9), 1824-1833</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>1824</StrtPage><EndPage>1833</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kantor ED" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Hutter CM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Minnier J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Berndt SI" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Caan BJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Campbell PT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Carlson CS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Casey G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Chan AT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Chang-Claude J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Chanock SJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Cotterchio M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Du M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Duggan D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Fuchs CS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Giovannucci EL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Gong J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Harrison TA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Hayes RB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Henderson BE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Hoffmeister M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="22" name="Hopper JL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Jenkins MA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Jiao S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Kolonel LN" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Le Marchand L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Lemire M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Ma J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Newcomb PA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Ochs-Balcom HM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Pflugeisen BM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Potter JD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Rudolph A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Schoen RE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Seminara D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Slattery ML" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Stelling DL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Thomas F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Thornquist M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Ulrich CM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="41" name="Warnick GS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Zanke BW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Peters U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="44" name="Hsu L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="45" name="White E" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24994789</PMID><DOI>10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-14-0062</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KST>C070</KST><KST>G110</KST></row><row><publishedID>50269</publishedID><Artikel>Quantification of changes in language-related brain areas in autism spectrum disorders using large-scale network analysis</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: Diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is difficult, as symptoms vary greatly and are difficult to quantify objectively. Recent work has focused on the assessment of non-invasive diffusion tensor imaging-based biomarkers that reflect the microstructural characteristics of neuronal pathways in the brain. While tractography-based approaches typically analyze specific structures of interest, a graph-based large-scale network analysis of the connectome can yield comprehensive measures of larger-scale architectural patterns in the brain. Commonly applied global network indices, however, do not provide any specificity with respect to functional areas or anatomical structures. Aim of this work was to assess the concept of network centrality as a tool to perform locally specific analysis without disregarding the global network architecture and compare it to other popular network indices. METHODS: We create connectome networks from fiber tractographies and parcellations of the human brain and compute global network indices as well as local indices for Wernicke's Area, Broca's Area and the Motor Cortex. Our approach was evaluated on 18 children suffering from ASD and 18 typically developed controls using magnetic resonance imaging-based cortical parcellations in combination with diffusion tensor imaging tractography. RESULTS: We show that the network centrality of Wernicke's area is significantly (p [Formula: see text] 0.001) reduced in ASD, while the motor cortex, which was used as a control region, did not show significant alterations. This could reflect the reduced capacity for comprehension of language in ASD. CONCLUSIONS: The betweenness centrality could potentially be an important metric in the development of future diagnostic tools in the clinical context of ASD diagnosis. Our results further demonstrate the applicability of large-scale network analysis tools in the domain of region-specific analysis with a potential application in many different psychological disorders.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (3), 357-365</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>357</StrtPage><EndPage>365</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Goch CJ" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Stieltjes B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Henze R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Hering J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Poustka L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Meinzer HP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Maier-Hein KH" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24459035</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s11548-014-0977-0</DOI><KST>E010</KST><KST>E130</KST><KST>E011</KST><KST>E132</KST><KEYWORD>HIGH-FUNCTIONING AUTISM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LATERALIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONNECTOMICS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASPERGER-SYNDROME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIAGNOSTIC INTERVIEW</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CLASSIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WHITE-MATTER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ORGANIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHILDREN</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50270</publishedID><Artikel>Medical image computing and image-based simulation: recent developments and advances in Germany</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (3), 341-343</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>341</StrtPage><EndPage>343</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Handels H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Meinzer HP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Deserno TM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Tolxdorff T" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24838658</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s11548-014-1073-1</DOI><KST>E130</KST></row><row><publishedID>50271</publishedID><Artikel>A second-generation protein-protein interaction network of Helicobacter pylori</Artikel><Journal>Molecular and Cellular Proteomics</Journal><ABSTr>Helicobacter pylori infections cause gastric ulcers and play a major role in the development of gastric cancer.

The integration of all the interactions reported in H. pylori results in 3004 unique interactions that connect about 70% of its proteome. Excluding interactions of promiscuous proteins we derived from our new data a core network consisting of 908 interactions.

HCMV inflicts site-specific double strand breaks (DSBs) in the cellular genome. DNA damage infliction raises the corollary question of virus modulation of DNA repair. We recently reported HDR was stimulated in wt human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) during fully permissive infection or expression of the HCMV protein IE1-72 (IE72). These studies have been extended into semi-permissive T98G glioblastoma cells. T98Gs encode a mutant p53, which may contribute to their high baseline rate of HDR. We fully expected HCMV infection to increase HDR in T98Gs, similar to its effects in HFFs. Surprisingly in T98Gs HCMV infection, or sole expression of IE72, decreased HDR by two-fold. Transient expression of wt p53 in T98Gs also reduced HDR by two-fold. Dual transient expression of wt p53 and IE72 restored high baseline HDR levels. GST pulldown experiments revealed that both IE72 and wt p53 bound the important HDR protein, Rad51. We conclude that the expression of certain HCMV proteins can modulate HDR in an infected cell, dependent upon p53 status. We propose a model of the protein interactions explaining this behavior.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>6 (3), 968-985</Feld596><PubVol>6</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>968</StrtPage><EndPage>985</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kulkarni AS" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Fortunato EA" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24576846</PMID><DOI>10.3390/v6030968</DOI><KST>F010</KST><KEYWORD>DNA-DAMAGE RESPONSES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PERMISSIVE LIFE-CYCLE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FIBROBLAST CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMMEDIATE-EARLY PROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STRAND BREAK REPAIR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>T-ANTIGEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN CYTOMEGALOVIRUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INFECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NUCLEOTIDE EXCISION-REPAIR</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50273</publishedID><Artikel>Generation of neuronal progenitor cells in response to tumors in the human brain</Artikel><Journal>Stem Cells</Journal><ABSTr>Data from transgenic mouse models show that neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) migrate toward experimental brain tumors and modulate the course of pathology. However, the pathways whereby NPCs are attracted to CNS neoplasms are not fully understood and it is unexplored if NPCs migrate toward brain tumors (high-grade astrocytomas) in humans. We analyzed the tumor-parenchyma interface of neurosurgical resections for the presence of (NPCs) and distinguished these physiological cells from the tumor mass. We observed that polysialic acid neural cell adhesion molecule-positive NPCs accumulate at the border of high-grade astrocytomas and display a marker profile consistent with immature migratory NPCs. Importantly, these high-grade astrocytoma-associated NPCs did not carry genetic aberrations that are indicative of the tumor. Additionally, we observed NPCs accumulating in CNS metastases. These metastatic tumors are distinguished from neural cells by defined sets of markers. Transplanting murine glioma cells embedded in a cell-impermeable hollow fiber capsule into the brains of nestin-gfp reporter mice showed that diffusible factors are sufficient to induce a neurogenic reaction. In vitro, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secreted from glioma cells increases the migratory and proliferative behavior of adult human brain-derived neural stem and progenitor cells via stimulation of VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2). In vivo, inhibiting VEGFR-2 signaling with a function-blocking antibody led to a reduction in NPC migration toward tumors. Overall, our data reveal a mechanism by which NPCs are attracted to CNS tumors and suggest that NPCs accumulate in human high-grade astrocytomas.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>32 (1), 244-257</Feld596><PubVol>32</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>244</StrtPage><EndPage>257</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Macas J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Ku MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Nern C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Xu Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Buhler H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Remke M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Synowitz M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Franz K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Seifert V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Plate KH" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Kettenmann H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Glass R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Momma S" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24170295</PMID><DOI>10.1002/stem.1581</DOI><KST>L501</KST><KEYWORD>GENE-THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WHITE-MATTER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH-FACTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MALIGNANT GLIOMAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUBVENTRICULAR ZONE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>neurogenesis</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEURAL STEM-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PRECURSOR CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADULT HUMAN BRAIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLULAR COMPOSITION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50274</publishedID><Artikel>Assessment of dedicated low-dose cardiac micro-CT reconstruction algorithms using the left ventricular volume of small rodents as a performance measure</Artikel><Journal>Medical Physics</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: Phase-correlated microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) imaging plays an important role in the assessment of mouse models of cardiovascular diseases and the determination of functional parameters as the left ventricular volume. As the current gold standard, the phase-correlated Feldkamp reconstruction (PCF), shows poor performance in case of low dose scans, more sophisticated reconstruction algorithms have been proposed to enable low-dose imaging. In this study, the authors focus on the McKinnon-Bates (MKB) algorithm, the low dose phase-correlated (LDPC) reconstruction, and the high-dimensional total variation minimization reconstruction (HDTV) and investigate their potential to accurately determine the left ventricular volume at different dose levels from 50 to 500 mGy. The results were verified in phantom studies of a five-dimensional (5D) mathematical mouse phantom. METHODS: Micro-CT data of eight mice, each administered with an x-ray dose of 500 mGy, were acquired, retrospectively gated for cardiac and respiratory motion and reconstructed using PCF, MKB, LDPC, and HDTV. Dose levels down to 50 mGy were simulated by using only a fraction of the projections. Contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was evaluated as a measure of image quality. Left ventricular volume was determined using different segmentation algorithms (Otsu, level sets, region growing). Forward projections of the 5D mouse phantom were performed to simulate a micro-CT scan. The simulated data were processed the same way as the real mouse data sets. RESULTS: Compared to the conventional PCF reconstruction, the MKB, LDPC, and HDTV algorithm yield images of increased quality in terms of CNR. While the MKB reconstruction only provides small improvements, a significant increase of the CNR is observed in LDPC and HDTV reconstructions. The phantom studies demonstrate that left ventricular volumes can be determined accurately at 500 mGy. For lower dose levels which were simulated for real mouse data sets, the HDTV algorithm shows the best performance. At 50 mGy, the deviation from the reference obtained at 500 mGy were less than 4%. Also the LDPC algorithm provides reasonable results with deviation less than 10% at 50 mGy while PCF and MKB reconstruction show larger deviations even at higher dose levels. CONCLUSIONS: LDPC and HDTV increase CNR and allow for quantitative evaluations even at dose levels as low as 50 mGy. The left ventricular volumes exemplarily illustrate that cardiac parameters can be accurately estimated at lowest dose levels if sophisticated algorithms are used. This allows to reduce dose by a factor of 10 compared to today's gold standard and opens new options for longitudinal studies of the heart.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>41 (5), Art.

However, epigenetic changes, including DNA methylation, deregulate gene expression and may also have prognostic impact. We evaluated the clinical relevance of integrating DNA methylation and genetic information in AML.

Methods Next-generation sequencing analysis of methylated DNA identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with prognostic mutations in older ( 60 years) cytogenetically normal (CN) patients with AML (n = 134). Genes with promoter DMRs and expression levels significantly associated with outcome were used to compute a prognostic gene expression weighted summary score that was tested and validated in four independent patient sets (n = 355).

Results In the training set, we identified seven genes (CD34, RHOC, SCRN1, F2RL1, FAM92A1, MIR155HG, and VWA8) with promoter DMRs and expression associated with overall survival (OS; P .001). Each gene had high DMR methylation and lower expression, which were associated with better outcome. A weighted summary expression score of the seven gene expression levels was computed. A low score was associated with a higher complete remission (CR) rate and longer disease-free survival and OS (P &lt; .001 for all end points). This was validated in multivariable models and in two younger (&lt; 60 years) and two older independent sets of patients with CN-AML. Considering the seven genes individually, the fewer the genes with high expression, the better the outcome. Younger and older patients with no genes or one gene with high expression had the best outcomes (CR rate, 94% and 87%, respectively; 3-year OS, 80% and 42%, respectively).

Conclusion A seven-gene score encompassing epigenetic and genetic prognostic information identifies novel AML subsets that are meaningful for treatment guidance.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>32 (6), 548-556</Feld596><PubVol>32</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>548</StrtPage><EndPage>556</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Marcucci,G."

Immunosuppressed transplant recipients are prone to harbor particularly high betapapillomavirus DNA loads, which may contribute to their highly increased risk of SCC. Tumor induction in HPV8 transgenic mice correlates with increased expression of viral oncogenes E6 and E2. In an attempt to prevent skin tumor development, we evaluated an HPV8-E6-DNA vaccine, which was able to stimulate a detectable HPV8-E6-specific cell-mediated immune response in 8/15 immunized mice. When skin of HPV8 transgenic mice was grafted onto non-transgenic littermates, the grafted HPV8 transgenic tissue was not rejected and papillomas started to grow within 14 days all over the transplant of 9/9 non-vaccinated and 7/15 not successfully vaccinated mice. In contrast, no papillomas developed in 6/8 successfully vaccinated mice. In the other two of these eight mice, a large ulcerative lesion developed within the initial papilloma growth or papilloma development was highly delayed. As the vaccine completely or partially prevented papilloma development without rejecting the transplanted HPV8 positive skin, the immune system appears to attack only keratinocytes with increased levels of E6 protein, which would give rise to papillomas.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>203 (3), 155-163</Feld596><PubVol>203</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>155</StrtPage><EndPage>163</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Marcuzzi GP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Awerkiew S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Hufbauer M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schaedlich L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Gissmann L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Eming S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Pfister H" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24446083</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00430-014-0327-4</DOI><KST>F020</KST><KEYWORD>HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS TYPE-8</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BETAPAPILLOMAVIRUS INFECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SKIN CANCERS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>intraepithelial neoplasia</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SQUAMOUS-CELL CARCINOMA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50277</publishedID><Artikel>Simulation of spatiotemporal CT data sets using a 4D MRI-based lung motion model</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: Four-dimensional CT imaging is widely used to account for motion-related effects during radiotherapy planning of lung cancer patients. However, 4D CT often contains motion artifacts, cannot be used to measure motion variability, and leads to higher dose exposure. In this article, we propose using 4D MRI to acquire motion information for the radiotherapy planning process. From the 4D MRI images, we derive a time-continuous model of the average patient-specific respiratory motion, which is then applied to simulate 4D CT data based on a static 3D CT. METHODS: The idea of the motion model is to represent the average lung motion over a respiratory cycle by cyclic B-spline curves. The model generation consists of motion field estimation in the 4D MRI data by nonlinear registration, assigning respiratory phases to the motion fields, and applying a B-spline approximation on a voxel-by-voxel basis to describe the average voxel motion over a breathing cycle. To simulate a patient-specific 4D CT based on a static CT of the patient, a multi-modal registration strategy is introduced to transfer the motion model from MRI to the static CT coordinates. RESULTS: Differences between model-based estimated and measured motion vectors are on average 1.39 mm for amplitude-based binning of the 4D MRI data of three patients. In addition, the MRI-to-CT registration strategy is shown to be suitable for the model transformation. CONCLUSIONS: The application of our 4D MRI-based motion model for simulating 4D CT images provides advantages over standard 4D CT (less motion artifacts, radiation-free). This makes it interesting for radiotherapy planning.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (3), 401-409</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>401</StrtPage><EndPage>409</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Marx M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Ehrhardt J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Werner R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schlemmer HP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Handels H" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24323401</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s11548-013-0963-y</DOI><KST>E010</KST><KEYWORD>DEFORMATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REGISTRATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VARIABILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RADIATION-THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>radiotherapy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMPACT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHASE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50278</publishedID><Artikel>Prognostic and predictive factors in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia: relevant in the era of novel treatment approaches?</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Clinical Oncology</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>32 (9), 869-872</Feld596><PubVol>32</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>869</StrtPage><EndPage>872</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Mertens D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Stilgenbauer S" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24516034</PMID><DOI>10.1200/JCO.2013.53.8421</DOI><KST>B061</KST><KEYWORD>B-CELL RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TP53</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SF3B1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Notch1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ZAP-70 EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE MUTATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FOLLOW-UP</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>1ST TREATMENT</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50283</publishedID><Artikel>Duration of the pre-diagnostic interval in medulloblastoma is subgroup dependent</Artikel><Journal>Pediatric Blood and Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Children presenting with medulloblastoma have a wide range of initial presenting symptoms. However, the influence of underlying tumor biology on the initial presentation of medulloblastoma is currently unknown. In light of the recent discovery of distinct medulloblastoma subgroups, we sought to define the initial presentation of childhood medulloblastoma in a subgroup specific manner. PROCEDURE: We assembled a cohort of 126 medulloblastoma cases at the Hospital for Sick Children between 1994 and 2012 and determined subgroup affiliation using nanoString. Clinical details pertaining to the initial presentation were determined through a retrospective chart review. RESULTS: The median pre-diagnostic interval across all medulloblastoma cases was 4 weeks (IQR: 4-12 weeks). Strikingly, when the pre-diagnostic interval was then determined in a subgroup specific manner, cases with WNT and Group 4 tumors showed significantly longer median pre-diagnostic intervals of 8 weeks compared to 2 weeks for SHH and 4 weeks for Group 3 (P = 0.0001). Younger age was significantly associated with a prolonged pre-diagnostic interval (P = 0.02 for all). When stratifying by subgroup the association with age was only significant in Group 4 (P = 0.04 for Group 4). Improved survival was significantly associated with a longer pre-diagnostic interval (P = 0.02), however is no longer significant when controlling for subgroup (P = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS: The duration of the pre-diagnostic interval in childhood medulloblastoma is highly subgroup dependent, further highlighting the clinical heterogeneity and biological relevance of the four principle subgroups of medulloblastoma.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>61 (7), 1190-1194</Feld596><PubVol>61</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>1190</StrtPage><EndPage>1194</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ramaswamy V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Remke M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Shih D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Wang X" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Northcott PA" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Faria CC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Raybaud C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Tabori U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Hawkins C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Rutka J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Taylor MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Bouffet E" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24616042</PMID><DOI>10.1002/pbc.24979</DOI><KST>B062</KST><KEYWORD>DIAGNOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>prognosis</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHILDREN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECURRENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TP53 mutation</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50288</publishedID><Artikel>Protocol for aerosol-free recombinant production and NMR analysis of prion proteins</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Biomolecular NMR</Journal><ABSTr>The central hallmark of prion diseases is the misfolding of cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) into a disease-associated aggregated isoform known as scrapie prion protein (PrP(Sc)). NMR spectroscopy has made many essential contributions to the characterization of recombinant PrP in its folded, unfolded and aggregated states. Recent studies reporting on de novo generation of prions from recombinant PrP and infection of animals using prion aerosols suggest that adjustment of current biosafety measures may be necessary, particularly given the relatively high protein concentrations required for NMR applications that favor aggregation. We here present a protocol for the production of recombinant PrP under biosafety level 2 conditions that avoids entirely exposure of the experimenter to aerosols that might contain harmful PrP aggregates. In addition, we introduce an NMR sample tube setup that allows for safe handling of PrP samples at the spectrometer that usually is not part of a dedicated biosafety level 2 laboratory.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>59 (2), 111-117</Feld596><PubVol>59</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>111</StrtPage><EndPage>117</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Rehbein P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Saxena K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Schlepckow K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schwalbe H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24771297</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s10858-014-9831-5</DOI><KST>L501</KST><KEYWORD>PRP</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CREUTZFELDT-JAKOB-DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>C-TERMINAL DOMAIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VARIANT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSMISSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BLOOD-TRANSFUSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AMYLOID FORMATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>UNFOLDED-STATE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50291</publishedID><Artikel>Lung and liver SBRT using helical tomotherapy - a dosimetric comparison of fixed jaw and dynamic jaw delivery</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Applied Clinical Medical Physics</Journal><ABSTr>The purpose of the study was to evaluate the time effectiveness and dose distribution details of dynamic jaw delivery compared to the regular helical tomotherapy delivery mode in stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) of liver and lung tumors. Ten patients with liver and ten patients with lung tumors were chosen to analyze the dose profiles and treatment times of regular helical tomotherapy delivery (2.5cm field width) and new helical tomotherapy mode using dynamic jaw delivery with 5 cm field width. A median dose between 24 and 30 Gy was delivered in a single fraction. Regular helical tomotherapy took an average of 31.9 +/- 6.7 min (lung SBRT) and 41.7 +/- 15.0 min (liver SBRT). A reduction in delivery duration of 38.8% to 19.5+/- 2.9 min could be accomplished for lung irradiation (p &amp;lt; 0.05) and by 50.8% to 20.5 +/- 6.0 min for liver SBRT (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Target coverage, as well as conformity and uniformity indices, showed no significant differences. No significant increase in organs-at-risk exposure could be detected either for lung or liver tumors. Therefore, use of new delivery mode with dynamic jaws improves treatment efficiency by reducing beam-on time, while maintaining excellent planquality.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>15 (3), 114-121</Feld596><PubVol>15</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>114</StrtPage><EndPage>121</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Rudofsky, L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Aynsley E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Beck S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schubert K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Habl G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Krause S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Debus J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Sterzing F" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24892338</PMID><KST>E050</KST><KEYWORD>COUCH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IRRADIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RADIATION-THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>metastases</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TREATMENT PLANS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STEREOTACTIC BODY RADIOTHERAPY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50292</publishedID><Artikel>[Multidisciplinary health care needs of psychologically distressed cancer patients in a Comprehensive Cancer Center]</Artikel><Journal>Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Considering the prolonged life-expectancies and the resulting demands that are placed on cancer patients and their relatives, the importance of specific counseling and support services including psycho-oncology, social services, nutritional, and exercise counseling has profoundly increased. The main focus of the current study was to evaluate the multidisciplinary health care needs of emotionally distressed cancer patients whoe were treated in a Comprehensive Cancer Center. METHODS AND STUDYGROUP: 831 out-patients were evaluated with regard to their psychological distress level and their multidisciplinary health care needs for specialist services of psycho-oncology, social services, nutritional, and exercise counseling using a tablet-PC assisted screening questionnaire. Separate analyses were completed for patients with and without psychological distress. RESULTS: One third of the screened patients showed clinically relevant psychological distress. Health care needs for all specialist services were significantly greater among these patients compared to patients without psychological distress (all p-values &lt; 0.005). The higher needs were foremost presented by the number of needed specialist services (p &lt; 0.001): two thirds of the psychologically distressed patients demonstrated, besides the need for a psycho-oncological service, a need for two or three further specialist services, whereas among patients without psychological distress more than 70% showed a need for at most one specialist service. CONCLUSION: Multidisciplinary health care needs of psychologically distressed cancer patients should be systematically addressed in a Comprehensive Cancer Center, and patients should be offered a coordinated and integrated health care program.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>139 (12), 587-591</Feld596><PubVol>139</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>587</StrtPage><EndPage>591</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schiel RO" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Brechtel A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Hartmann M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Taubert A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Walther J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Wiskemann J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Roetzer I" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Becker N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Jaeger D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Herzog W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Friederich HC" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24619716</PMID><DOI>10.1055/s-0034-1369856</DOI><KST>G110</KST><KST>D120</KST><KEYWORD>INTERVENTIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANXIETY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>depression</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FATIGUE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURVIVORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METAANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BREAST-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>validation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>radiotherapy</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50293</publishedID><Artikel>Exceptionally long-term persistence of DNA adducts formed by carcinogenic aristolochic acid I in renal tissue from patients with aristolochic acid nephropathy</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Aristolochic acid (AA) causes aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN), first described in women in Belgium accidently prescribed Aristolochia fangchi in a slimming treatment, and also Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN), through probable dietary contamination with Aristolochia clematitis seeds. Both nephropathies have a high risk of urothelial cancer, with AA being the causative agent. In tissues of AAN and BEN patients, a distinct DNA adduct, 7-(deoxyadenosin-N6-yl)-aristolactam I (dA-AAI), has been detected. DNA adducts can be removed through DNA repair, they can result in mutations through erroneous DNA replication or they can cause cell death. The dA-AAI adduct induces AT to TA transversions in the tumor-suppressor TP53 gene in experimental systems, matching TP53 mutations observed in urothelial tumors from AAN cancer cases. Using thin-layer chromatography 32P-postlabeling and mass spectrometric analysis we report the detection of dA-AAI in renal DNA from 11 Belgian AAN patients over 20 years after exposure to AA had ceased. Our results showed that dA-AAI is an established biomarker of AA exposure, and that this biomarker can be demonstrated to be persistent decades after a distinct AA exposure. Further, the persistence of dA-AAI adducts appears to be a critical determinant for the AA mutational fingerprint frequently found in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes recently identified by whole genome sequencing of AA-associated urothelial tumors. The potential for exposure to AA worldwide is high; the unprecedented long-term persistence of dA-AAI provides a useful long-term biomarker of exposure and attests to the role of AA in human urothelial malignancy.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>135 (2), 502-507</Feld596><PubVol>135</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>502</StrtPage><EndPage>507</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schmeiser HH" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Nortier JL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Singh R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="da Costa GG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Sennesael J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Cassuto-Viguier E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Ambrosetti D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Rorive S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Pozdzik A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Phillips DH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Stiborova M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Arlt VM" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24921086</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28681</DOI><KST>E030</KST><KST>C016</KST><KEYWORD>DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPOSURE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>kidney</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MASS-SPECTROMETRY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>urothelial cancer</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHINESE HERBS NEPHROPATHY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50294</publishedID><Artikel>A three component mix of thioredoxin-L2 antigens elicits broadly neutralizing responses against oncogenic human papillomaviruses</Artikel><Journal>Vaccine</Journal><ABSTr>Current human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines based on major capsid protein L1 virus-like particles (VLP) provide potent type-specific protection against vaccine-type viruses (mainly HPV16 and 18), but cross-protect against only a small subset of the approximately 15 oncogenic HPV types. It is estimated that L1-VLP vaccines, which require a fairly complex production system and are still quite costly, fail to cover 20-30% of HPV cervical cancers worldwide, especially in low-resource countries. Alternative antigens relying on the N-terminal region of minor capsid protein L2 are intrinsically less immunogenic but capable of eliciting broadly neutralizing responses. We previously demonstrated the enhanced immunogenicity and cross-neutralization potential of an easily produced recombinant L2 antigen bearing the HPV16 L2(20-38) peptide epitope internally fused to bacterial thioredoxin (Trx). However, antibodies induced by Trx-HPV16 L2(20-38) failed to cross-neutralize notable high-risk HPV types such as HPV31. In the present work, the Trx-L2 design was modified to include L2 sequence information from the highly divergent HPV31 and HPV51 types in addition to HPV16, with the aim of extending cross-neutralization. Multivalent antigens comprising L2(20-38) peptides from all three HPV types on a single Trx scaffold molecule were compared to a mixture of the three type-specific monovalent Trx-L2 antigens. While multivalent antigens as well as the mixed antigens elicited similar anti-HPV16 neutralization titers, cross-reactive responses against HPV31 and HPV51 were of higher magnitude and more robust for the latter formulation. A mixture of monovalent Trx-L2 antigens thus represents a candidate lead for the development of a broadly cross-protective, low-cost second-generation anti-HPV vaccine.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>32 (22), 2610-2617</Feld596><PubVol>32</PubVol><PubIss>22</PubIss><StrtPage>2610</StrtPage><EndPage>2617</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Seitz H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Canali E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Ribeiro-Mueller L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Palfi A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Bolchi A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Tommasino M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Ottonello S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Mueller M" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24662712</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.03.033</DOI><KST>F035</KST><KEYWORD>L2</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MINOR CAPSID PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TERMINUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HPV types</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>antibodies</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VACCINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPITOPES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INFECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CROSS-NEUTRALIZATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50295</publishedID><Artikel>Free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin, total human chorionic gonadotropin and maternal risk of breast cancer</Artikel><Journal>Future Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: We investigated whether the free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (free beta-hCG) would provide additional information to that provided by total hCG alone and thus be useful in future epidemiological studies relating hCG to maternal breast cancer risk.

METHODSBetween 1998 and 2008, 79 patients with chondrosarcoma of the skull base were treated using carbon ions in raster scanning. The applied median total dose was 60 gray equivalent (GyE) at 3 GyE per fraction. Local control and overall survival (OS) were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Long-term toxicity was quantitatively assessed using questionnaires.

RESULTSThe median follow-up after irradiation was 91 months (range, 3 months-175 months). Within the follow-up, 10 patients developed local disease recurrence. The 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year local control rates were 95.9%, 88%, and 88%, respectively; the corresponding OS rates were 96.1%, 96.1%, and 78.9%, respectively. With a median follow-up of 110 months after first diagnosis, the corresponding 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year OS rates were 97.5%, 97.5%, and 91.5%, respectively. Age45 years and boost volume55 mL were associated with significantly better local control rates. We observed a clinically relevant improvement in cranial nerve deficits 7 to 10 years after treatment (range, 45.5%-53.3%) compared with the baseline (73.4%). During follow-up, none of the patients in the current study developed a secondary malignancy.

CONCLUSIONSCarbon ion therapy is a safe and effective treatment in patients with chondrosarcoma of the skull base. For further evaluation, a prospective randomized phase 3 trial comparing protons versus carbon ions has been recruiting patients with low-grade and intermediate-grade chondrosarcoma of the skull base since 2009.

Due to the central role of the fragile X mental retardation gene 1 protein (FMRP) pathway in ASD we investigated common functional variants of ASD risk genes regulating FMRP. We genotyped ten SNPs in two German patient sets (N = 192 and N = 254 families, respectively) and report association for rs7170637 (CYFIP1; set 1 and combined sets), rs6923492 (GRM1; combined sets), and rs25925 (CAMK4; combined sets). An additional risk score based on variants with an odds ratio (OR) &gt;1.25 in set 1 and weighted by their respective log transmitted/untransmitted ratio revealed a significant effect (OR 1.30, 95 % CI 1.11-1.53; P = 0.0013) in the combined German sample. A subsequent meta-analysis including the two German samples, the "Strict/European" ASD subsample of the Autism Genome Project (1,466 families) and a French case/control (541/366) cohort showed again association of rs7170637-A (OR 0.85, 95 % CI 0.75-0.96; P = 0.007) and rs25925-G (OR 1.31, 95 % CI 1.04-1.64; P = 0.021) with ASD. Functional analyses revealed that these minor alleles predicted to alter splicing factor binding sites significantly increase levels of an alternative mRNA isoform of the respective gene while keeping the overall expression of the gene constant. These findings underpin the role of ASD candidate genes in postsynaptic FMRP regulation suggesting that an imbalance of specific isoforms of CYFIP1, an FMRP interaction partner, and CAMK4, a transcriptional regulator of the FMRP gene, modulates ASD risk. Both gene products are related to neuronal regulation of synaptic plasticity, a pathomechanism underlying ASD and may thus present future targets for pharmacological therapies in ASD.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>133 (6), 781-792</Feld596><PubVol>133</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>781</StrtPage><EndPage>792</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Waltes R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Duketis E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Knapp M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Anney RJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Huguet G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Schlitt S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Jarczok TA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Sachse M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Kampfer LM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Kleinbock T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Poustka F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Bolte S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Schmotzer G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Voran A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Huy E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Meyer J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Bourgeron T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Klauck SM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="18" name="Freitag CM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Chiocchetti AG" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24442360</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00439-013-1416-y</DOI><KST>B050</KST><KST>B063</KST><KEYWORD>MESSENGER-RNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FRAGILE-X-SYNDROME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIAGNOSTIC INTERVIEW</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MENTAL-RETARDATION PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEIN-KINASE-IV</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GERMAN FORM</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50298</publishedID><Artikel>Subgroup-specific localization of human medulloblastoma based on pre-operative MRI</Artikel><Journal>Acta Neuropathologica</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>127 (6), 931-933</Feld596><PubVol>127</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>931</StrtPage><EndPage>933</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Wefers AK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Warmuth-Metz M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Poeschl J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="von Bueren AO" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Monoranu CM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Seelos K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Peraud A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Tonn JC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Koch A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Pietsch T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Herold-Mende C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Mawrin C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Schouten-van Meeteren A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="van Vuurden D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="von Hoff K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Rutkowski S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Pfister SM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="17" name="Kool M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="18" name="Schueller U" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24699697</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00401-014-1271-5</DOI><KST>B062</KST><KEYWORD>SUBTYPES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISTINCT</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50333</publishedID><Artikel>Incidence of colorectal adenomas: Birth cohort analysis among 4.3 million participants of screening colonoscopy</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers and Prevention</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (), 1920-1927</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>1920</StrtPage><EndPage>1927</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Altenhofen L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Stock C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Hoffmeister M" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25012996</PMID><DOI>10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-14-0367</DOI><KST>C070</KST></row><row><publishedID>50470</publishedID><Artikel>Separation of Nb-90 from zirconium target for application in immuno-PET</Artikel><Journal>Radiochimica Acta</Journal><ABSTr>Fast progressing immuno- PET asks to explore new radionuclides. One of the promising candidates is Nb-90. It has a half-life of 14.6 h that allows visualizing and quantifying biological processes with medium and slow kinetics, such as tumor accumulation of antibodies and antibodies fragments or drug delivery systems and nanoparticles. Nb-90 exhibits a positron branching of 53% and an average kinetic energy of emitted positrons of.. mean = 0.35MeV. Currently, radionuclide production routes and Nb V labeling techniques are explored to turn this radionuclide into a useful imaging probe. However, efficient separation of Nb-90 from irradiated targets remains in challenge.

Ion exchange based separation of Nb-90 from zirconium targets was investigated in systems AG 1 x 8 - HCl/H2O2 and UTEVA-HCl. Nb-95 (t(1/2) = 35.0 d), Zr-95 (t(1/2) = 64.0 d) and (92m) Nb (t(1/2) = 10.15 d) were chosen for studies on distribution coefficients. Separation after AG 1 x 8 anion exchange yields 99% of Nb-90/95. Subsequent use of a solid-phase extraction step on UTEVA resin further decontaminates Nb-90/95 from traces of zirconium with yields 95% of Nb-90/95.

A semi-automated separation takes one hour to obtain an overall recovery of Nb-90/95 of 90%. The amount of Zr was reduced by factor of 10(8). The selected separation provides rapid preparation (&lt; 1h) of high purity Nb-90 appropriate for the synthesis of Nb-90-radiopharmaceuticals, relevant for purposes of immuno-PET. Applying the radioniobium obtained, Nb-90/95-labeling of a monoclonal antibody (rituximab) modified with desferrioxamine achieved labeling yields of&gt; 90% after 1 h incubation at room temperature.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>102 (5), 433-442</Feld596><PubVol>102</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>433</StrtPage><EndPage>442</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Radchenko,V."

For the two main histotypes, namely esophageal squamous cell carcinomas and Barrett's adenocarcinomas, several genetic aberrations have been shown to contribute to carcinogenesis and progression as well as to represent potential novel targets for therapeutic intervention. This is paralleled by growing insight into epigenetic alterations of esophageal cancers. Studies involving the analyses of human tissue specimens predominantly describe altered patterns of miRNA expression, DNA methylation patterns, and histone marks levels. This review provides a critical update on this increasing knowledge of epigenetic alteration in esophageal cancers by specifically focusing on the translational aspects of epigenetic analyses from human tissue specimens.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>356 (3), 643-655</Feld596><PubVol>356</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>643</StrtPage><EndPage>655</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ahrens TD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Werner M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Lassmann S" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24816987</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00441-014-1876-y</DOI><KST>L601</KST><KEYWORD>MICRORNA EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>histone modifications</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LINE-1 HYPOMETHYLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BARRETTS-ESOPHAGUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SQUAMOUS-CELL CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>adenocarcinoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METASTASIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA methylation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>APOPTOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50486</publishedID><Artikel>Biomarker patterns of inflammatory and metabolic pathways are associated with risk of colorectal cancer: results from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Epidemiology</Journal><ABSTr>A number of biomarkers of inflammatory and metabolic pathways are individually related to higher risk of colorectal cancer (CRC); however, the association between biomarker patterns and CRC incidence has not been previously evaluated. Our study investigates the association of biomarker patterns with CRC in a prospective nested case-control study within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). During median follow-up time of 7.0 (3.7-9.4) years, 1,260 incident CRC cases occurred and were matched to 1,260 controls using risk-set sampling. Pre-diagnostic measurements of C-peptide, glycated hemoglobin, triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), C-reactive protein (CRP), reactive oxygen metabolites (ROM), insulin-like growth factor 1, adiponectin, leptin and soluble leptin receptor (sOB-R) were used to derive biomarker patterns from principal component analysis (PCA). The relation with CRC incidence was assessed using conditional logistic regression models. We identified four biomarker patterns 'HDL-C/Adiponectin fractions', 'ROM/CRP', 'TG/C-peptide' and 'leptin/sOB-R' to explain 60 % of the overall biomarker variance. In multivariable-adjusted logistic regression, the 'HDL-C/Adiponectin fractions', 'ROM/CRP' and 'leptin/sOB-R' patterns were associated with CRC risk [for the highest quartile vs the lowest, incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.69, 95 % CI 0.51-0.93, P-trend = 0.01; IRR = 1.70, 95 % CI 1.30-2.23, P-trend = 0.002; and IRR = 0.79, 95 % CI 0.58-1.07; P-trend = 0.05, respectively]. In contrast, the 'TG/C-peptide' pattern was not associated with CRC risk (IRR = 0.75, 95 % CI 0.56-1.00, P-trend = 0.24). After cases within the first 2 follow-up years were excluded, the 'ROM/CRP' pattern was no longer associated with CRC risk, suggesting potential influence of preclinical disease on these associations. By application of PCA, the study identified 'HDL-C/Adiponectin fractions', 'ROM/CRP' and 'leptin/sOB-R' as biomarker patterns representing potentially important pathways for CRC development.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>29 (4), 261-275</Feld596><PubVol>29</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>261</StrtPage><EndPage>275</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Aleksandrova K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Jenab M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Fedirko V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kaaks R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Lukanova A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="van Duijnhoven FJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Jansen E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Rinaldi S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Romieu I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Ferrari P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Murphy N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Gunter MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Westhpal S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Halkjaer J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Boutron-Ruault MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Dossus L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Racine A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Bamia C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Orfanos P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Agnoli C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Palli D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Panico S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Vineis P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Peeters PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Duell EJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Molina-Montes E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Quiros JR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Dorronsoro M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Chirlaque MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Barricarte A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Ljuslinder I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Palmqvist R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Travis RC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Wareham N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Pischon T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24791703</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s10654-014-9901-8</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>C-REACTIVE PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BINDING-PROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OXIDATIVE STRESS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INSULIN-RESISTANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADIPOSE-TISSUE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DENSITY-LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PLASMA ADIPONECTIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MULTIPLE IMPUTATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HDL-CHOLESTEROL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SOLUBLE LEPTIN RECEPTOR</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50487</publishedID><Artikel>Detection of high-risk human papillomavirus type 16 and 18 using isothermal helicase-dependent amplification</Artikel><Journal>Diagnostic Microbiology and Infectious Disease</Journal><ABSTr>Persistent infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) induces cervical cancer.

Impressive in vivo diagnostic data were published for glucagonlike peptide 1 receptor-targeting radiopeptides. Recently, promising in vitro data have appeared for the second member of the incretin family, the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor. This prompted us to develop and evaluate a new class of radioligands with the potential to be used for the in vivo targeting of GIP receptor-positive tumors. METHODS: GIP(1-42) was modified C-terminally, and the truncated peptides [Lys30(aminohexanoic acid [Ahx]-DOTA)]GIP(1-30)NH2 (EG1), [Lys16(Ahx-DOTA)]GIP(1-30)NH2 (EG2), and [Nle14, Lys30(Ahx-DOTA)]GIP(1-30)NH2 (EG4) were conjugated with Ahx-DOTA via the Lys16 and Lys30 side chains. Their inhibitory concentration of 50% (IC50) was determined using [125I-Tyr10]GIP(1-30) as radioligand and GIP(1-30) as control peptide. The DOTA conjugates were labeled with 111In and 68Ga. In vitro evaluation included saturation and internalization studies using the pancreatic endocrine cell line INR1G9 transfected with the human GIP receptor (INR1G9-hGIPr). The in vivo evaluation consisted of biodistribution and PET imaging studies on nude mice bearing INR1G9-hGIPr tumors. RESULTS: Binding studies (IC50 and saturation studies) showed high affinity toward GIP receptor for the GIP conjugates. Specific in vitro internalization was found, and almost the entire cell-associated activity was internalized (&gt;90% of the cell-bound activity), supporting the agonist potency of the 111In-vectors. 111In-EG4 and 68Ga-EG4 were shown to specifically target INR1G9-hGIPr xenografts, with tumor uptake of 10.4% +/- 2.2% and 17.0% +/- 4.4% injected activity/g, 1 h after injection, respectively. Kidneys showed the highest uptake, which could be reduced by approximately 40%-50% with a modified-fluid-gelatin plasma substitute or an inhibitor of the serine protease dipeptidyl peptidase 4. The PET images clearly visualized the tumor. CONCLUSION: The evaluation of EG4 as a proof-of-principle radioligand indicated the feasibility of imaging GIP receptor-positive tumors. These results prompt us to continue the development of this family of radioligands for imaging of a broad spectrum of NETs.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>55 (6), 976-982</Feld596><PubVol>55</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>976</StrtPage><EndPage>982</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Gourni E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Waser B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Clerc P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Fourmy D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Reubi JC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Maecke HR" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24744444</PMID><DOI>10.2967/jnumed.113.133744</DOI><KST>L601</KST><KEYWORD>DEGRADATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIGAND</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>mechanisms</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PEPTIDE RECEPTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RADIOLABELED SOMATOSTATIN ANALOG</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLUCAGON</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLP-1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GIP</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INSULINOMAS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50489</publishedID><Artikel>Choice of reconstructed tissue properties affects interpretation of lung EIT images</Artikel><Journal>Physiological measurement</Journal><ABSTr>Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) estimates an image of change in electrical properties within a body from stimulations and measurements at surface electrodes. There is significant interest in EIT as a tool to monitor and guide ventilation therapy in mechanically ventilated patients. In lung EIT, the EIT inverse problem is commonly linearized and only changes in electrical properties are reconstructed. Early algorithms reconstructed changes in resistivity, while most recent work using the finite element method reconstructs conductivity. Recently, we demonstrated that EIT images of ventilation can be misleading if the electrical contrasts within the thorax are not taken into account during the image reconstruction process. In this paper, we explore the effect of the choice of the reconstructed electrical properties (resistivity or conductivity) on the resulting EIT images. We show in simulation and experimental data that EIT images reconstructed with the same algorithm but with different parametrizations lead to large and clinically significant differences in the resulting images, which persist even after attempts to eliminate the impact of the parameter choice by recovering volume changes from the EIT images. Since there is no consensus among the most popular reconstruction algorithms and devices regarding the parametrization, this finding has implications for potential clinical use of EIT. We propose a program of research to develop reconstruction techniques that account for both the relationship between air volume and electrical properties of the lung and artefacts introduced by the linearization.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>35 (6), 1035-1050</Feld596><PubVol>35</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>1035</StrtPage><EndPage>1050</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Grychtol B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Adler A" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24844670</PMID><DOI>10.1088/0967-3334/35/6/1035</DOI><KST>E020</KST><KEYWORD>NEED</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BIOLOGICAL TISSUES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIELECTRIC-PROPERTIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ELECTRICAL-IMPEDANCE TOMOGRAPHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FREQUENCY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AIR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VENTILATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MODEL</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50490</publishedID><Artikel>Diagnostic value of immunohistochemistry for the detection of the BRAF(V600E) mutation in papillary thyroid carcinoma: comparative analysis with three DNA-based assays</Artikel><Journal>Thyroid</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare the detection of BRAF(V600E) by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using a mutation-specific antibody with molecular biology methods for evaluation of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study concerned 198 consecutive conventional PTC patients, of which the majority were women (133/198; 67%), with a mean age of 56 years (range 19-79 years). BRAF mutation analysis was performed using DNA-based (direct sequencing, pyrosequencing, and SNaPshot) and IHC (VE1 antibody) methods. The sensitivity and specificity of IHC for BRAF(V600E) was compared with the molecular biology data. RESULTS: A BRAF mutational result was obtained in 194 cases. A BRAF(V600E) mutation was detected in 153/194 (79%) cases of PTC when using at least one molecular method, and in 151/194 (78%) cases with IHC. No false positive results were noted using IHC to detect the BRAF(V600E) mutation. Besides this mutation, other rare BRAF mutations (BRAF(V600K) and BRAF(K601E)), used as negative controls, were consistently negative with IHC. The sensitivity and specificity of IHC for the detection of this mutation were 98.7% and 100% respectively. The IHC test demonstrated excellent performance at a level equivalent to two DNA-based counterparts (pyrosequencing and SNaPshot). Failure to achieve a result was more frequent with the direct sequencing method than with the three other methods. CONCLUSION: IHC using the VE1 antibody is a specific and sensitive method for the detection of the BRAF(V600E) mutation in PTC. IHC may be an alternative to molecular biology approaches for the routine detection of this mutation in PTC patients.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>24 (5), 858-866</Feld596><PubVol>24</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>858</StrtPage><EndPage>866</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ilie MI" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Lassalle S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Long-Mira E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Bonnetaud C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Bordone O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Lespinet V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Lamy A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Sabourin JC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Haudebourg J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Butori C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Guevara N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Peyrottes I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Sadoul JL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Bozec A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Santini J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Capper D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="16" name="von Deimling A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="17" name="Emile JF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Hofman V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Hofman P" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24417277</PMID><DOI>10.1089/thy.2013.0302</DOI><KST>G380</KST><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMPACT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METASTATIC MELANOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECURRENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BRAF V600E MUTATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TARGETED THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CLINICAL-IMPLICATIONS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50491</publishedID><Artikel>Non-invasive risk scores for prediction of type 2 diabetes (EPIC-InterAct): a validation of existing models</Artikel><Journal>Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: The comparative performance of existing models for prediction of type 2 diabetes across populations has not been investigated. We validated existing non-laboratory-based models and assessed variability in predictive performance in European populations. METHODS: We selected non-invasive prediction models for incident diabetes developed in populations of European ancestry and validated them using data from the EPIC-InterAct case-cohort sample (27,779 individuals from eight European countries, of whom 12,403 had incident diabetes). We assessed model discrimination and calibration for the first 10 years of follow-up. The models were first adjusted to the country-specific diabetes incidence. We did the main analyses for each country and for subgroups defined by sex, age (&lt;60 years vs &gt;/=60 years), BMI (&lt;25 kg/m(2)vs &gt;/=25 kg/m(2)), and waist circumference (men &lt;102 cm vs &gt;/=102 cm; women &lt;88 cm vs &gt;/=88 cm). FINDINGS: We validated 12 prediction models. Discrimination was acceptable to good: C statistics ranged from 0.76 (95% CI 0.72-0.80) to 0.81 (0.77-0.84) overall, from 0.73 (0.70-0.76) to 0.79 (0.74-0.83) in men, and from 0.78 (0.74-0.82) to 0.81 (0.80-0.82) in women. We noted significant heterogeneity in discrimination (pheterogeneity&lt;0.0001) in all but one model. Calibration was good for most models, and consistent across countries (pheterogeneity&gt;0.05) except for three models. However, two models overestimated risk, DPoRT by 34% (95% CI 29-39%) and Cambridge by 40% (28-52%). Discrimination was always better in individuals younger than 60 years or with a low waist circumference than in those aged at least 60 years or with a large waist circumference. Patterns were inconsistent for BMI. All models overestimated risks for individuals with a BMI of &lt;25 kg/m(2). Calibration patterns were inconsistent for age and waist-circumference subgroups. INTERPRETATION: Existing diabetes prediction models can be used to identify individuals at high risk of type 2 diabetes in the general population. However, the performance of each model varies with country, age, sex, and adiposity.

The dysregulated expression or function of caspase-8 can promote tumor formation, progression and treatment resistance in different human cancers. Here, we show procaspase-8 is regulated during the cell cycle through the concerted inhibitory action of Cdk1/cyclin B1 and polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1). By phosphorylating S387 in procaspase-8 Cdk1/cyclin B1 generates a phospho-epitope for the binding of the PBD of Plk1. Subsequently, S305 in procaspase-8 is phosphorylated by Plk1 during mitosis. Using an RNAi-based strategy we could demonstrate that the extrinsic cell death is increased upon Fas-stimulation when endogenous caspase-8 is replaced by a mutant (S305A) mimicking the non-phosphorylated form. Together, our data show that sequential phosphorylation by Cdk1/cyclin B1 and Plk1 decreases the sensitivity of cells toward stimuli of the extrinsic pathway during mitosis. Thus, the clinical Plk1 inhibitor BI 2536 decreases the threshold of different cancer cell types toward Fas-induced cell death.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>8 (3), 596-608</Feld596><PubVol>8</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>596</StrtPage><EndPage>608</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Matthess Y" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Raab M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Knecht R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Becker S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Strebhardt K" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24484936</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.molonc.2013.12.013</DOI><KST>L501</KST><KEYWORD>MITOTIC ARREST</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CYCLIN B1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR-NECROSIS-FACTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BOX DOMAIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POLO-LIKE KINASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRAIL-INDUCED APOPTOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SIGNALING COMPLEX</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50493</publishedID><Artikel>Inflammation and prolonged QT time: results from the Cardiovascular Disease, Living and Ageing in Halle (CARLA) study</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Previous research found an association of CRP with QT time in population based samples. Even more, there is evidence of a substantial involvement of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha system in the pathophysiology of cardiac arrhythmia, while the role of Interleukin 6 remains inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between inflammation with an abnormally prolonged QT-time (APQT) in men and women of the elderly general population. METHODS: Data descend from the baseline examination of the prospective, population-based Cardiovascular Disease, Living and Ageing in Halle (CARLA) Study. After exclusion of subjects with atrial fibrillation and missing ECG recording the final study cohort consisted of 919 men and 797 women. Blood parameters of inflammation were the soluble TNF-Receptor 1 (sTNF-R1), the high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and Interleukin 6 (IL-6). In accordance with major cardiologic societies we defined an APQT above a QT time of 460 ms in women and 450 ms in men. Effect sizes and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated by performing multiple linear and logistic regression analyses including the analysis of sex differences by interaction terms. RESULTS: After covariate adjustment we found an odds ratio (OR) of 1.89 (95% CI: 1.13, 3.17) per 1000 pg/mL increase of sTNF-R1 in women, and 0.74 (95% CI: 0.48, 1.15) in men. In the covariate adjusted linear regression sTNF-R1 was again positively associated with QT time in women (5.75 ms per 1000 pg/mL, 95% CI: 1.32, 10.18), but not in men. Taking possible confounders into account IL-6 and hsCRP were not significantly related to APQT in both sexes. CONCLUSION: Our findings from cross-sectional analyses give evidence for an involvement of TNF-alpha in the pathology of APQT in women.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (4), e95994-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>e95994</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Medenwald D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Kors JA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Loppnow H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Thiery J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kluttig A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Nuding S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Tiller D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Greiser KH" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Werdan K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Haerting J" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24770373</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0095994</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>TNF-ALPHA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ATRIAL-FIBRILLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CIRCULATING LEVELS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR-NECROSIS-FACTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>C-REACTIVE PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIRECTED ACYCLIC GRAPHS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANALYSIS SYSTEM MEANS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VENTRICULAR MYOCYTES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CAUSAL-DIAGRAMS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50494</publishedID><Artikel>Harnessing high density lipoproteins to block transforming growth factor beta and to inhibit the growth of liver tumor metastases</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) is a powerful promoter of cancer progression and a key target for antitumor therapy. As cancer cells exhibit active cholesterol metabolism, high density lipoproteins (HDLs) appear as an attractive delivery system for anticancer TGFbeta-inhibitory molecules. We constructed a plasmid encoding a potent TGF-beta-blocking peptide (P144) linked to apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) through a flexible linker (pApoLinkerP144). The ApoLinkerP144 sequence was then incorporated into a hepatotropic adeno-associated vector (AAVApoLinkerP144). The aim was to induce hepatocytes to produce HDLs containing a modified ApoA-I capable of blocking TGF-beta. We observed that transduction of the murine liver with pApoLinkerP144 led to the appearance of a fraction of circulating HDL containing the fusion protein. These HDLs were able to attenuate TGF-beta signaling in the liver and to enhance IL-12 -mediated IFN-gamma production. Treatment of liver metastasis of MC38 colorectal cancer with AAVApoLinkerP144 resulted in a significant reduction of tumor growth and enhanced expression of IFN-gamma and GM-CSF in cancerous tissue. ApoLinkerP144 also delayed MC38 liver metastasis in Rag2-/-IL2rgamma-/- immunodeficient mice. This effect was associated with downregulation of TGF-beta target genes essential for metastatic niche conditioning. Finally, in a subset of ret transgenic mice, a model of aggressive spontaneous metastatic melanoma, AAVApoLinkerP144 delayed tumor growth in association with increased CD8+ T cell numbers in regional lymph nodes. In conclusion, modification of HDLs to transport TGF-beta-blocking molecules is a novel and promising approach to inhibit the growth of liver metastases by immunological and non-immunological mechanisms.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (5), e96799-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>e96799</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Medina-Echeverz J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Fioravanti J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Diaz-Valdes N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Frank K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Aranda F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Gomar C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Ardaiz N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Dotor J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Umansky V" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Prieto J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Berraondo P" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24797128</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0096799</DOI><KST>G300</KST><KEYWORD>SYNTHETIC PEPTIDE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADENOASSOCIATED VIRUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MELANOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>T-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>immune cells</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSGENIC MOUSE MODEL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TGF-BETA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50495</publishedID><Artikel>Comparative next-generation sequencing of adeno-associated virus inverted terminal repeats</Artikel><Journal>Biotechniques</Journal><ABSTr>The inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) of adeno-associated virus (AAV) are notoriously difficult to sequence owing to their high GC-content (70%) and palindromic sequences that result in the formation of a very stable, 125 bp long, T-shaped hairpin structure. Here we evaluate the performance of two widely used next-generation sequencing platforms, 454 GS FLX (Roche) and MiSeq Benchtop Sequencer (Illumina), in analyzing ITRs in comparatively sequencing linear amplification-meditated PCR (LAM-PCR) amplicons derived from AAV-concatemeric structures. While our data indicate that both platforms can sequence complete ITRs, efficiencies (MiSeq: 0.11% of sequence reads; 454: 0.02% of reads), frequencies (MiSeq: 171 full ITRs, 454: 3 full ITRs), and rates of deviation from the derived ITR consensus sequence (MiSeq: 0.8%-1.3%; 454: 0.5%) did differ. These results suggest that next-generation sequencing platforms can be used to specifically detect ITR mutations and sequence complete ITRs.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>56 (5), 269-273</Feld596><PubVol>56</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>269</StrtPage><EndPage>273</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Petri K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Fronza R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Gabriel R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kaeppel C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Nowrouzi A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Linden RM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Henckaerts E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Schmidt M" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24806228</PMID><DOI>10.2144/000114170</DOI><KST>G100</KST><KST>E210</KST><KEYWORD>INTEGRATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-TRANSFER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VECTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRIAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LEBERS CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50496</publishedID><Artikel>RANK expression as a prognostic and predictive marker in breast cancer</Artikel><Journal>Breast Cancer Research and Treatment</Journal><ABSTr>RANK ligand (RANKL) is crucial for the development of mouse mammary glands during pregnancy. RANKL functions as a major paracrine effector of the mitogenic action of progesterone in mammary epithelium via its receptor RANK and has a role in expansion and regenerative potential of mammary stem cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of RANKL attenuates the development of mammary carcinoma and inhibits metastatic progression in multiple mouse models. Primary breast carcinoma samples from the neoadjuvant GeparTrio study were analyzed to correlate the expression of human RANK and RANKL with pathological complete response (pCR), disease-free (DFS), and overall (OS) survival. Pre-treatment FFPE core biopsies (n = 601) were analyzed for percentage and intensity of immunohistochemical RANK and RANKL expression. Antibodies against human RANK (N-1H8; Amgen) and human RANKL (M366; Amgen) were used. RANK protein was expressed in 160 (27 %) patients. Increased RANK expression was observed in 14.5 % of patients and correlated with high tumor grade (p &lt; 0.023) and negative hormone receptor (HR) status (p &lt; 0.001). Patients with high RANK expression showed a higher pCR rate (23.0 % vs. 12.6 %, p = 0.010), shorter DFS (p = 0.038), and OS (p = 0.011). However, prognostic and predictive information was not an independent parameter. Only 6 % of samples expressed RANKL, which was not correlated with any clinical features. Higher RANK expression in the primary tumor is associated with a higher sensitivity to chemotherapy, but also a higher risk of relapse and death. Our study provides a basis for further exploration of the antitumor activity of clinical antibodies against RANKL.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>145 (2), 307-315</Feld596><PubVol>145</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>307</StrtPage><EndPage>315</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Pfitzner BM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Branstetter D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Loibl S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Denkert C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Lederer B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Schmitt WD" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Dombrowski F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Werner M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Ruediger T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Dougall WC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="von Minckwitz G" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24737168</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s10549-014-2955-1</DOI><KST>L601</KST><KST>L201</KST><KST>L501</KST><KEYWORD>III RANDOMIZED GEPARTRIO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RANKL/RANK/OPG</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DENOSUMAB</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIGAND</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PREOPERATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMORIGENESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEOADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>bone metastasis</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OSTEOCLAST</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50497</publishedID><Artikel>Deleterious RAD51C germline mutations rarely predispose to breast and ovarian cancer in Pakistan</Artikel><Journal>Breast Cancer Research and Treatment</Journal><ABSTr>RAD51C plays a key role in homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair and maintenance of genomic stability. Biallelic RAD51C mutations cause Fanconi anemia, and monoallelic mutations predispose women to breast and ovarian cancer. Genetic variability of RAD51C and its impact in Asian populations have been poorly studied. Here, we report the results of comprehensive mutational screening of the RAD51C gene in 348 BRCA1/2-negative breast and/or ovarian cancer patients from Pakistan. Mutation analysis of the complete RAD51C-coding region was performed using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography analysis, followed by DNA sequencing of variant fragments. Three novel protein-truncating mutations, c.204T &gt; A, c.225T &gt; G, and c.701C &gt; G, were identified. c.204T &gt; A was found in one out of 22 (4.5 %) early-onset (a parts per thousand currency sign45 years of age) ovarian cancer patients and c.225T &gt; G in one out of 119 (0.8 %) patients from breast cancer only families. c.701C &gt; G was found in a 60-year-old control with no family history of breast/ovarian cancer. Furthermore, three novel in silico-predicted potentially functional mutations, a missense mutation, c.873T &gt; G, a variant in 5'UTR, c.1-34T &gt; G, and a recurrent intronic variant, c.965+21A &gt; G, were identified. The missense mutation was observed in a patient with bilateral breast cancer from a breast and ovarian cancer family (HBOC), the 5'UTR variant was noted in an early-onset breast cancer patient, and the intronic variant in one early-onset breast cancer patient and one ovarian cancer patient from a HBOC family. Five of the six mutations described were not detected in 400 healthy controls. These findings suggest that RAD51C plays a marginal role in breast and ovarian cancer predisposition in Pakistan. Reliable estimation of the clinical implications of carrying a deleterious RAD51C mutation will require identification of additional mutation-positive patients/families.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>145 (3), 775-784</Feld596><PubVol>145</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>775</StrtPage><EndPage>784</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Rashid,M.U."

We compared genomic profiles of 27 paired primary and recurrent IDH1/2 wild-type glioblastomas by genome-wide array-based comparative genomic hybridization. By bioinformatic analysis, primary and recurrent tumor profiles were normalized and segmented, chromosomal gains and losses identified taking the tumor cell content into account, and difference profiles deduced. Seven of 27 (26%) pairs lacked DNA copy number differences between primary and recurrent tumors (equal pairs). The recurrent tumors in 9/27 (33%) pairs contained all chromosomal imbalances of the primary tumors plus additional ones, suggesting a sequential acquisition of and/or selection for aberrations during progression (sequential pairs). In 11/27 (41%) pairs, the profiles of primary and recurrent tumors were divergent, i.e., the recurrent tumors contained additional aberrations but had lost others, suggesting a polyclonal composition of the primary tumors and considerable clonal evolution (discrepant pairs). Losses on 9p21.3 harboring the CDKN2A/B locus were significantly more common in primary tumors from sequential and discrepant (nonequal) pairs. Nonequal pairs showed ten regions of recurrent genomic differences between primary and recurrent tumors harboring 46 candidate genes associated with tumor recurrence. In particular, copy numbers of genes encoding apoptosis regulators were frequently changed at progression. In summary, approximately 25% of IDH1/2 wild-type glioblastoma pairs have stable genomic imbalances. In contrast, approximately 75% of IDH1/2 wild-type glioblastomas undergo further genomic aberrations and alter their clonal composition upon recurrence impacting their genomic profile, a process possibly facilitated by 9p21.3 loss in the primary tumor.

Using reporter gene assays we examined the activation of beta-Catenin mediated transcription upon PI3K inhibition with or without beta-Catenin nuclear accumulation. Ectopically induced as well as constitutively active WNT signaling strictly required PI3K activity whereas PI3K inhibition had no effect on beta-Catenin subcellular localization but impaired beta-Catenin binding to WNT target gene promoters and decreased WNT target gene expression. Transcriptional activity of nuclear beta-Catenin depended on active PI3K signaling as nuclear accumulation of beta-Catenin failed to induce WNT reporter gene transcription upon PI3K inhibition. PI3K dependend transcriptional transactivation of beta-Catenin relies on events beyond phosphorylation at the AKT target site serine 552, as S552D-phosphomimetic beta-Catenin mutants were unable to restore WNT signaling when inhibiting PI3K. To study the prognostic value of PI3K pathway activation (activating PIK3CA mutations or loss of PTEN expression) and nuclear beta-Catenin expression, both variables were determined in 55 matched pairs of primary right sided colon cancer cases with or without distant metastasis. Activating mutations in the PIK3CA gene or loss of PTEN expression did not correlate with distant metastasis while high nuclear beta-Catenin expression combined with activation of the PI3K pathway identified cases in which distant metastasis had occurred. Activation of the PI3K pathway was not associated with nuclear beta-Catenin expression. We conclude that the transcriptional activity of nuclear beta-Catenin depends on PI3K activity. However, PI3K on its own does not affect beta-Catenin subcellular localization. Both factors synergize for full WNT signaling activity and are associated with distant metastasis in colon cancer. Thus, the detection of high nuclear beta-Catenin expression and simultaneous PI3K pathway activation identifies colon cancer patients with a high risk for distant metastasis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>5 (10), 2999-3011</Feld596><PubVol>5</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>2999</StrtPage><EndPage>3011</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ormanns S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Neumann J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Horst D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kirchner T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Jung A" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24930890</PMID><KST>L701</KST><KEYWORD>C-MYC</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STEM-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TARGET</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHWAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WNT/BETA-CATENIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPITHELIAL-MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CYCLIN D1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR PTEN</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50501</publishedID><Artikel>Isolated trisomy 13 defines a genetically homogenous AML subgroup with high frequency of mutations in spliceosome genes and poor prognosis</Artikel><Journal>Blood</Journal><ABSTr>Isolated trisomy 13 (AML+13) is a rare chromosomal abnormality in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and its prognostic relevance is poorly characterized. We analyzed the clinical course of 34 AML+13 patients enrolled in the German AMLCG-1999 and SAL trials and studied their biological characteristics by exome sequencing, targeted sequencing of candidate genes and gene expression profiling. Relapse-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS) of AML+13 patients were inferior compared to other ELN Intermediate-II patients (n=855) (median RFS, 7.8 vs 14.1 months, p=0.006; median OS 9.3 vs. 14.8 months, p=0.004). Besides the known high frequency of RUNX1 mutations (75%), we identified mutations in spliceosome components in 88%, including SRSF2 codon 95 mutations in 81%, of AML+13 patients. Moreover, recurring mutations were detected in ASXL1 (44%) and BCOR (25%). Two patients carried mutations in CEBPZ, suggesting that CEBPZ is a novel recurrently mutated gene in AML. Gene expression analysis revealed a homogenous expression profile including upregulation of FOXO1 and FLT3 and downregulation of SPRY2. This is the most comprehensive clinical and biological characterization of AML+13 to date, and reveals a striking clustering of lesions in a few genes, defining AML+13 as a genetically homogenous leukemia subgroup with alterations in a few critical cellular pathways.

METHODS: Between 2005 and 2010, 50 patients (pts) with high risk STS (size &gt;/= 5 cm, deep/extracompartimental location, grade II-III (FNCLCC)) were enrolled. The protocol comprised 4 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with EIA (etoposide, ifosfamide and doxorubicin), definitive surgery with IOERT, postoperative EBRT and 4 adjuvant cycles of EIA. 34 pts, who suffered from extremity tumors and received radiation therapy after limb-sparing surgery, formed the basis of this subgroup analysis. RESULTS: Median follow-up from inclusion was 48 months in survivors. Margin status was R0 in 30 pts (88%) and R1 in 4 pts (12%). IOERT was performed as planned in 31 pts (91%) with a median dose of 15 Gy, a median electron energy of 6 MeV and a median cone size of 9 cm. All patients received postoperative EBRT with a median dose of 46 Gy after IOERT or 60 Gy without IOERT. Median time from surgery to EBRT and median EBRT duration was 36 days, respectively. One patient developed a local recurrence while 11 patients showed nodal or distant failures. The estimated 5-year rates of local control, distant control and overall survival were 97%, 66% and 79%, respectively. Postoperative wound complications were found in 7 pts (20%), resulting in delayed EBRT (&gt;60 day interval) in 3 pts. Acute radiation toxicity mainly consisted of radiation dermatitis (grade II: 24%, no grade III reactions). 4 pts developed grade I/II radiation recall dermatitis during adjuvant chemotherapy, which resolved during the following cycles. Severe late toxicity was observed in 6 pts (18%). Long-term limb preservation was achieved in 32 pts (94%) with good functional outcome in 81%. CONCLUSION: Multimodal therapy including IOERT and postoperative EBRT resulted in excellent local control and good overall survival in patients with high risk STS of the extremities with acceptable acute and late radiation side effects. Limb preservation with good functional outcome was achieved in the majority of patients.

Previous studies have reported that polymorphisms in NSAID-metabolizing enzymes central to NSAID metabolism including UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGT) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 may modify this protective effect. We investigated whether 35 functionally relevant polymorphisms within CYP2C9 and UGT genes were associated with colorectal cancer risk or modified the protective effect of NSAIDs on colorectal cancer susceptibility, using 1,584 colorectal cancer cases and 2,516 unaffected sibling controls from the Colon Cancer Family Registry. A three-SNP genotype in UGT1A6 (G-A-A; Ala7-Thr181-Arg184) and the Asp85 variant in UGT2B15 increased the risk of colorectal cancer (OR 3.87; 95% CI 1.04-14.45 and OR 1.34; 95% CI 1.10-1.63, respectively). We observed interactions between UGT1A3 Thr78Thr (A&gt;G) and NSAID use (P-interaction = 0.02), a three-SNP genotype within UGT2B4 and ibuprofen use (P-interaction = 0.0018), as well as UGT2B15 Tyr85Asp (T&gt;G) and aspirin use (P-interaction = 0.01). The interaction with the UGT2B4 and the UGT2B15 polymorphisms were noteworthy at the 25% FDR level. This study highlights the need for further pharmacogenetic studies to identify individuals who might benefit from NSAID use as part of developing effective strategies for prevention of colorectal neoplasia.

While most studies focus on later disease stages, the onset of aberrant DNA methylation events and their dynamics during leukemic progression are largely unknown. METHODS: We screened genome-wide for aberrant CpG island methylation in three disease stages of a murine AML model that is driven by hypomorphic expression of the hematopoietic transcription factor PU.1. DNA methylation levels of selected genes were correlated with methylation levels of CD34+ cells and lineage negative, CD127-, c-Kit+, Sca-1+ cells; common myeloid progenitors; granulocyte-macrophage progenitors; and megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors. RESULTS: We identified 1,184 hypermethylated array probes covering 762 associated genes in the preleukemic stage. During disease progression, the number of hypermethylated genes increased to 5,465 in the late leukemic disease stage. Using publicly available data, we found a significant enrichment of PU.1 binding sites in the preleukemic hypermethylated genes, suggesting that shortage of PU.1 makes PU.1 binding sites in the DNA accessible for aberrant methylation. Many known AML associated genes such as RUNX1 and HIC1 were found among the preleukemic hypermethylated genes. Nine novel hypermethylated genes, FZD5, FZD8, PRDM16, ROBO3, CXCL14, BCOR, ITPKA, HES6 and TAL1, the latter four being potential PU.1 targets, were confirmed to be hypermethylated in human normal karyotype AML patients, underscoring the relevance of the mouse model for human AML. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified early aberrantly methylated genes as potential contributors to onset and progression of AML.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>6 (4), Art.

We analyzed a missense VUS located in BRCA2 (p.Asn3124Ile; HGVS: BRCA2 c.9371A &gt; T) present in seven independent high-risk breast cancer families that were counseled and genetically tested in South-West Germany. The VUS was identified by DNA sequencing. We analyzed co-occurrence with deleterious BRCA1/2 mutations, segregation, evolutionary conservation, in silico impact prediction, and prevalence in the general population. All carriers of the VUS suffered from breast or ovarian cancer. In two families, an additional high burden of other cancers such as pancreatic, prostate, and gastric cancers was reported, one further family included two cases of male breast cancer. The VUS did not co-occur with deleterious BRCA1/2 mutations and segregated in two affected individuals of one family. In contrast to the 7/1,347 (0,5 %) tested high-risk BC families without clearly pathogenic mutations in BRCA1/2, none of 3,126 healthy population controls sharing the same ethnic and geographical background were found to carry this VUS (p = 0.0002). In-silico prediction revealed strong evolutionary conservation of the asparagine residue, residing in the C-terminal oligonucleotide-binding-fold-3 region, and a most likely damaging impact of this exchange on the protein structure. The BRCA2 p.Asn3124Ile (BRCA2 c.9371A &gt; T) variant is a rare mutation with a damaging effect on the BRCA2 protein that is strongly associated with familial breast and ovarian cancer risk, indicating its most likely pathogenic nature and clinical relevance.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>145 (2), 451-460</Feld596><PubVol>145</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>451</StrtPage><EndPage>460</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Surowy HM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Sutter C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Mittnacht M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Klaes R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schaefer D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Evers C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Burgemeister AL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Goehringer C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Dikow N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Heil J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Golatta M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Schott S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Schneeweiss A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Bugert P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Sohn C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Bartram CR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Burwinkel B" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24728577</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s10549-014-2943-5</DOI><KST>C080</KST><KEYWORD>DNA-BINDING</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OVARIAN-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BREAST-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CARRIERS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>germline mutations</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISKS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER SUSCEPTIBILITY GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PANCREATIC-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>inherited mutations</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FANCONI-ANEMIA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50628</publishedID><Artikel>Inhibition of glucose turnover by 3-bromopyruvate counteracts pancreatic cancer stem cell features and sensitizes cells to gemcitabine</Artikel><Journal>Oncotarget</Journal><ABSTr>According to the cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis, the aggressive growth and early metastasis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is due to the activity of CSCs, which are not targeted by current therapies. Otto Warburg suggested that the growth of cancer cells is driven by a high glucose metabolism. Here, we investigated whether glycolysis inhibition targets CSCs and thus may enhance therapeutic efficacy. Four established and 3 primary PDA cell lines, non-malignant cells, and 3 patient-tumor-derived CSC-enriched spheroidal cultures were analyzed by glucose turnover measurements, MTT and ATP assays, flow cytometry of ALDH1 activity and annexin positivity, colony and spheroid formation, western blotting, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, xenotransplantation, and immunohistochemistry. The effect of siRNA-mediated inhibition of LDH-A and LDH-B was also investigated. The PDA cells exhibited a high glucose metabolism, and glucose withdrawal or LDH inhibition by siRNA prevented growth and colony formation. Treatment with the anti-glycolytic agent 3-bromopyruvate almost completely blocked cell viability, self-renewal potential, NF-kappa B binding activity, and stem cell-related signaling and reverted gemcitabine resistance. 3-bromopyruvate was less effective in weakly malignant PDA cells and did not affect non-malignant cells, predicting minimal side effects. 3-bromopyruvate inhibited in vivo tumor engraftment and growth on chicken eggs and mice and enhanced the efficacy of gemcitabine by influencing the expression of markers of proliferation, apoptosis, self-renewal, and metastasis. Most importantly, primary CSC-enriched spheroidal cultures were eliminated by 3-bromopyruvate. These findings propose that CSCs may be specifically dependent on a high glucose turnover and suggest 3-bromopyruvate for therapeutic intervention.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>5 (13), 5177-5189</Feld596><PubVol>5</PubVol><PubIss>13</PubIss><StrtPage>5177</StrtPage><EndPage>5189</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Isayev,O."

The radiometal chelator HBED-CC used in this molecule represents a rather rarely used acyclic complexing agent with chemical characteristics favourably influencing the biological functionality of the PSMA inhibitor. The simple replacement of HBED-CC by the prominent radiometal chelator DOTA was shown to dramatically reduce the in vivo imaging quality of the respective 68Ga-labelled PSMA-targeted tracer proving that HBED-CC contributes intrinsically to the PSMA binding of the Glu-urea-Lys(Ahx) pharmacophore. Owing to the obvious growing clinical impact, this work aims to reflect the properties of HBED-CC as acyclic radiometal chelator and presents novel preclinical data and relevant aspects of the radiopharmaceutical production process of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>7 (7), 779-796</Feld596><PubVol>7</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>779</StrtPage><EndPage>796</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Eder,M.*" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Neels,O.*" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Mueller,M."

Several pairs of injection electrodes are used in order to constitute a data set spanning the whole range of azimuths, and the electrical potential is measured along a cable covering an angular sector of approximate to 120 degrees along the basis of the dome. The data are inverted to perform a slice electrical resistivity tomography (SERT) with specific functions implemented in the EIDORS open source package dedicated to electrical impedance tomography applied to medicine and geophysics. The resulting image shows the presence of highly conductive regions separated by resistive ridges. The conductive regions correspond to unconsolidated material saturated by hydrothermal fluids. Two of them are associated with partial flank collapses and may represent large reservoirs that could have played an important role during past eruptive events. The resistive ridges may represent massive andesite and are expected to constitute hydraulic barriers.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>197 (3), 1516-1526</Feld596><PubVol>197</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>1516</StrtPage><EndPage>1526</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Lesparre,N."

NRPSs act as peptide assembly lines where individual, often interconnected modules each incorporate a specific amino acid into the nascent chain. The modules themselves consist of several domains that function in the activation, modification and condensation of the substrate. NRPSs are evidently modular, yet experimental proof of the ability to engineer desired permutations of domains and modules is still sought. Here, we use a synthetic-biology approach to create a small library of engineered NRPSs, in which the domain responsible for carrying the activated amino acid (T domain) is exchanged with natural or synthetic T domains. As a model system, we employ the single-module NRPS IndC from Photorhabdus luminescens that produces the blue pigment indigoidine. As chassis we use Escherichia coli. We demonstrate that heterologous T domain exchange is possible, even for T domains derived from different organisms. Interestingly, substitution of the native T domain with a synthetic one enhanced indigoidine production. Moreover, we show that selection of appropriate inter-domain linker regions is critical for functionality. Taken together, our results extend the engineering avenues for NRPSs, as they point out the possibility of combining domain sequences coming from different pathways, organisms or from conservation criteria. Moreover, our data suggest that NRPSs can be rationally engineered to control the level of production of the corresponding peptides. This could have important implications for industrial and medical applications.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>10 (7), 1709-1718</Feld596><PubVol>10</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>1709</StrtPage><EndPage>1718</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Beer R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Herbst K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Ignatiadis N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kats I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Adlung L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Meyer H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Niopek D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Christiansen T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Georgi F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Kurzawa N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Meichsner J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Rabe S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Riedel A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Sachs J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Schessner J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Schmidt F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Walch P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Niopek K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="18" name="Heinemann T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="19" name="Eils R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="20" name="Di Ventura B" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24457530</PMID><DOI>10.1039/c3mb70594c</DOI><KST>B080</KST><KST>A150</KST><KST>A170</KST><KEYWORD>POLYMERASE EXTENSION CLONING</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>4'-PHOSPHOPANTETHEINYL TRANSFERASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHOTORHABDUS-LUMINESCENS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANTIBIOTIC PRODUCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADENYLATION DOMAINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>bacterial</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ESCHERICHIA-COLI</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BIOSYNTHESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SEQUENCE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50828</publishedID><Artikel>Chemotherapy for advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma in elderly patients 70 years of age and more): A retrospective cohort study at the National Center for Tumor Diseases Heidelberg</Artikel><Journal>Pancreatology</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>14 (3), 211-215</Feld596><PubVol>14</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>211</StrtPage><EndPage>215</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Berger,A.K."

Here we analyzed the Mlh1-Mlh2 complex, whose role in MMR has been unclear. Mlh1-Mlh2 formed foci that often colocalized with and had a longer lifetime than Mlh1-Pms1 foci. Mlh1-Mlh2 foci were similar to Mlh1-Pms1 foci: they required mispair recognition by Msh2-Msh6, increased in response to increased mispairs or downstream defects in MMR, and formed after induction of DNA damage by phleomycin but not double-stranded breaks by I-SceI. Mlh1-Mlh2 could be recruited to mispair-containing DNA in vitro by either Msh2-Msh6 or Msh2-Msh3. Deletion of MLH2 caused a synergistic increase in mutation rate in combination with deletion of MSH6 or reduced expression of Pms1. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the S. cerevisiae Mlh2 protein and the mammalian PMS1 protein are homologs. These results support a hypothesis that Mlh1-Mlh2 is a non-essential accessory factor that acts to enhance the activity of Mlh1-Pms1.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>10 (5), e1004327-</Feld596><PubVol>10</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>e1004327</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Campbell CS*" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Hombauer H*" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Srivatsan A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Bowen N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Gries K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Desai A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Putnam CD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Kolodner RD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name=".(* Co-first authors)" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24811092</PMID><KST>A310</KST><KEYWORD>MUTL-ALPHA ENDONUCLEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE ORDER BROWSER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HETERODUPLEX REJECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POLYMERASE-DELTA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEINS MSH2</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BINDING DOMAIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DOUBLE-STRAND BREAKS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BUDDING YEAST</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>recombination</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50830</publishedID><Artikel>Ultrafast CEST imaging</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Magnetic Resonance</Journal><ABSTr>We describe a new MR imaging method for the rapid characterization or screening of chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) contrast agents. It is based on encoding the chemical shift dimension with an additional gradient as proposed in previous ultrafast CEST spectroscopy approaches, but extends these with imaging capabilities. This allows us to investigate multiple compounds simultaneously with an arbitrary sample tube arrangement. The technique requires a fast multislice readout to ensure the saturation is not lost during data acquisition due to T1 relaxation. We therefore employ radial subsampling, acquiring only 10 projections per CEST image with a 128x128 matrix. To recover the images, we use a heuristic reconstruction algorithm that incorporates low rank and limited object support as prior knowledge. This way, we are able to acquire a spectral CEST data set consisting of 15 saturation offsets more than 16 times faster than compared with conventional CEST imaging.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>243 (), 47-53</Feld596><PubVol>243</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>47</StrtPage><EndPage>53</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Doepfert J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Zaiss M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Witte C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schroeder L" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24721681</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.jmr.2014.03.008</DOI><KST>E020</KST><KEYWORD>DOMAIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MRI</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SPECTROSCOPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECONSTRUCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXCHANGE SATURATION-TRANSFER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SPARSITY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50832</publishedID><Artikel>Interaction between the ADAMTS-12 metalloprotease and fibulin-2 induces tumor-suppressive effects in breast cancer cells</Artikel><Journal>Oncotarget</Journal><ABSTr>Balance between pro-tumor and anti-tumor effects may be affected by molecular interactions within tumor microenvironment. On this basis we searched for molecular partners of ADAMTS-12, a secreted metalloprotease that shows both oncogenic and tumor-suppressive effects. Using its spacer region as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified fibulin-2 as a potential ADAMTS-12-interacting protein. Fibulins are components of basement membranes and elastic matrix fibers in connective tissue. Besides this structural function, fibulins also play crucial roles in different biological events, including tumorigenesis. To examine the functional consequences of the ADAMTS-12/fibulin-2 interaction, we performed different in vitro assays using two breast cancer cell lines: the poorly invasive MCF-7 and the highly invasive MDA-MB-231. Overall our data indicate that this interaction promotes anti-tumor effects in breast cancer cells. To assess the in vivo relevance of this interaction, we induced tumors in nude mice using MCF-7 cells expressing both ADAMTS-12 and fibulin-2 that showed a remarkable growth deficiency. Additionally, we also found that ADAMTS-12 may elicit pro-tumor effects in the absence of fibulin-2. Immunohistochemical staining of breast cancer samples allowed the detection of both ADAMTS-12 and fibulin-2 in the connective tissue surrounding tumor area in less aggressive carcinomas. However, both proteins are hardly detected in more aggressive tumors. These data and survival analysis plots of breast cancer patients suggest that concomitant detection of ADAMTS-12 and fibulin-2 could be a good prognosis marker in breast cancer diagnosis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>5 (5), 1253-1264</Feld596><PubVol>5</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>1253</StrtPage><EndPage>1264</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Fontanil T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Rua S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Llamazares M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Moncada-Pazos A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Quiros PM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Garcia-Suarez O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Vega JA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Sasaki T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Mohamedi Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Esteban MM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Obaya AJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Cal S" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24457941</PMID><KST>A100</KST><KEYWORD>EXTRACELLULAR-MATRIX PROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METASTASIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BINDING</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DOMAIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FAMILY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOLECULES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INVASION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANGIOGENESIS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50833</publishedID><Artikel>Radiological monitoring of the treatment of solid tumors in practice</Artikel><Journal>Rofo - Fortschritte Auf dem Gebiet der Roentgenstrahlen und der Bildgebenden Verfahren</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: Thanks to advances in cancer therapy, the diagnosis of "incurable cancer" is increasingly able to be changed to a chronic disease that is manageable over long periods, resulting in a change in the clinical management of cancer patients with solid tumors. New parameters are needed to measure the success of targeted therapy in clinical trials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Review article on the basis of selective literature research. RESULTS: In order to assess how well solid tumors respond to treatment, size-based criteria called RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid tumors) have been defined. These criteria have been validated in large oncology trials and are currently used most frequently. New molecular therapies often do not - or at least do not immediately - reduce the size of a tumor. Therefore, RECIST evaluation should be critically assessed especially in the case of modern therapies. Any additional available tumor biology information should be considered. In radiology new methods and developments of RECIST have been introduced to better assess the success of targeted therapy. CONCLUSION: Assessment according to RECIST has been proven for the follow-up of classic tumor therapy. For the monitoring of targeted therapies, new parameters are often required. Therefore, some specific tumor- and therapy-adapted criteria have already been defined to better evaluate treatment success in clinical trials.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>186 (5), 466-473</Feld596><PubVol>186</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>466</StrtPage><EndPage>473</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ganten MK" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Ganten TM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Schlemmer HP" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24563412</PMID><DOI>10.1055/s-0033-1356329</DOI><KST>E010</KST><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GUIDELINES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHASE-II</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GASTROINTESTINAL STROMAL TUMORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MALIGNANT-LYMPHOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADVANCED HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WORKING GROUP</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECIST</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RESPONSE EVALUATION CRITERIA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50834</publishedID><Artikel>Alpha image reconstruction (AIR): A new iterative CT image reconstruction approach using voxel-wise alpha blending</Artikel><Journal>Medical Physics</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: Iterative image reconstruction gains more and more interest in clinical routine, as it promises to reduce image noise (and thereby patient dose), to reduce artifacts, or to improve spatial resolution. Among vendors and researchers, however, there is no consensus of how to best achieve these aims. The general approach is to incorporatea priori knowledge into iterative image reconstruction, for example, by adding additional constraints to the cost function, which penalize variations between neighboring voxels. However, this approach to regularization in general poses a resolution noise trade-off because the stronger the regularization, and thus the noise reduction, the stronger the loss of spatial resolution and thus loss of anatomical detail. The authors propose a method which tries to improve this trade-off. The proposed reconstruction algorithm is called alpha image reconstruction (AIR). One starts with generating basis images, which emphasize certain desired image properties, like high resolution or low noise. The AIR algorithm reconstructs voxel-specific weighting coefficients that are applied to combine the basis images. By combining the desired properties of each basis image, one can generate an image with lower noise and maintained high contrast resolution thus improving the resolution noise trade-off. METHODS: All simulations and reconstructions are performed in native fan-beam geometry. A water phantom with resolution bar patterns and low contrast disks is simulated. A filtered backprojection (FBP) reconstruction with a Ram-Lak kernel is used as a reference reconstruction. The results of AIR are compared against the FBP results and against a penalized weighted least squares reconstruction which uses total variation as regularization. The simulations are based on the geometry of the Siemens Somatom Definition Flash scanner. To quantitatively assess image quality, the authors analyze line profiles through resolution patterns to define a contrast factor for contrast-resolution plots. Furthermore, the authors calculate the contrast-to-noise ratio with the low contrast disks and the authors compare the agreement of the reconstructions with the ground truth by calculating the normalized cross-correlation and the root-mean-square deviation. To evaluate the clinical performance of the proposed method, the authors reconstruct patient data acquired with a Somatom Definition Flash dual source CT scanner (Siemens Healthcare, Forchheim, Germany). RESULTS: The results of the simulation study show that among the compared algorithms AIR achieves the highest resolution and the highest agreement with the ground truth. Compared to the reference FBP reconstruction AIR is able to reduce the relative pixel noise by up to 50% and at the same time achieve a higher resolution by maintaining the edge information from the basis images. These results can be confirmed with the patient data. CONCLUSIONS: To evaluate the AIR algorithm simulated and measured patient data of a state-of-the-art clinical CT system were processed. It is shown, that generating CT images through the reconstruction of weighting coefficients has the potential to improve the resolution noise trade-off and thus to improve the dose usage in clinical CT.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>41 (6), Art.

We identify a subset of mouse and human HCCs harboring VEGFA genomic amplification, displaying distinct biologic characteristics. Unlike common tumor amplifications, this one seems to work via heterotypic paracrine interactions; stromal VEGF receptors (VEGFR), responding to tumor VEGF-A, produce hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) that reciprocally affects tumor cells. VEGF-A inhibition results in HGF downregulation and reduced proliferation, specifically in amplicon-positive mouse HCCs. Sorafenib-the first-line drug in advanced HCC-targets multiple kinases, including VEGFRs, but has only an overall mild beneficial effect. We found that VEGFA amplification specifies mouse and human HCCs that are distinctly sensitive to sorafenib. FISH analysis of a retrospective patient cohort showed markedly improved survival of sorafenib-treated patients with VEGFA-amplified HCCs, suggesting that VEGFA amplification is a potential biomarker for HCC response to VEGF-A-blocking drugs. SIGNIFICANCE: Using a mouse model of inflammation-driven cancer, we identified a subclass of HCC carrying VEGFA amplification, which is particularly sensitive to VEGF-A inhibition. We found that a similar amplification in human HCC identifies patients who favorably responded to sorafenib-the first-line treatment of advanced HCC-which has an overall moderate therapeutic efficacy.

METHODS: The relative electron density varrhoe and effective atomic number Zeff are calculated for 71 tabulated tissue compositions. For MC simulations, the mass density is derived via one linear fit in the varrhoe that covers the entire range of tissue compositions (except lung tissue). Elemental mass fractions are predicted from the varrhoe and the Zeff in combination. Since particle therapy dose planning and verification is especially sensitive to accurate material assignment, differences to the ground truth are further analyzed for mass density, I-value predictions, and stopping power ratios (SPR) for ions. Dose studies with monoenergetic proton and carbon ions in 12 tissues which showed the largest differences of single energy CT (SECT) to DECT are presented with respect to range uncertainties. The standard approach (SECT) and the new DECT approach are compared to reference Bragg peak positions. RESULTS: Mean deviations to ground truth in mass density predictions could be reduced for soft tissue from (0.5+/-0.6)% (SECT) to (0.2+/-0.2)% with the DECT method. Maximum SPR deviations could be reduced significantly for soft tissue from 3.1% (SECT) to 0.7% (DECT) and for bone tissue from 0.8% to 0.1%. MeanI-value deviations could be reduced for soft tissue from (1.1+/-1.4%, SECT) to (0.4+/-0.3%) with the presented method. Predictions of elemental composition were improved for every element. Mean and maximum deviations from ground truth of all elemental mass fractions could be reduced by at least a half with DECT compared to SECT (except soft tissue hydrogen and nitrogen where the reduction was slightly smaller). The carbon and oxygen mass fraction predictions profit especially from the DECT information. Dose studies showed that most of the 12 selected tissues would profit significantly (up to 2.2%) from DECT material decomposition with no noise present. The varrhoe associated with an absolute noise of +/-0.01 and Zeff associated with an absolute noise of +/-0.2 resulted in +/-10% standard variation in the carbon and oxygen mass fraction prediction. CONCLUSIONS: Accurate stopping power prediction is mainly determined by the correct mass density prediction. Theoretical improvements in range predictions with DECT data in the order of 0.1%-2.1% were observed. Further work is needed to quantify the potential improvements from DECT compared to SECT in measured image data associated with artifacts and noise.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>41 (6), Art.

We have developed an integration-deficient lentiviral vector (IDLV) system generating mitotically stable episomes capable of long-term transgene expression. We found that a transient cell cycle arrest at the time of transduction with IDLVs resulted in 13-45% of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing the transgene for over 100 cell generations in the absence of selection. The use of a scaffold/matrix attachment region did not result in improved episomal retention in this system, and episomes did not form after transduction with adeno-associated viral or minicircle vectors under the same conditions. Investigations into the episomal status of the vector genome using (1) linear amplification-mediated polymerase chain reaction followed by deep sequencing of vector-genome junctions, (2) Southern blotting, and (3) fluorescent in situ hybridization strongly suggest that the vector is not integrated in the vast majority of cells. In conclusion, we have developed an IDLV procedure generating mitotically stable episomes capable of long-term transgene expression. The application of this approach to stem cell populations could significantly improve the safety profile of a range of stem and progenitor cell gene therapies.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>25 (5), 428-442</Feld596><PubVol>25</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>428</StrtPage><EndPage>442</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kymalainen H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Appelt JU" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Giordano FA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Davies AF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Ogilvie CM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Ahmed SG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Laufs S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Schmidt M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Bode J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Yanez-Munoz RJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Dickson G" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24483952</PMID><DOI>10.1089/hum.2013.172</DOI><KST>G100</KST><KEYWORD>VIRUS TYPE-1 INTEGRASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DUPLEX DESTABILIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSDUCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SEQUENCES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>T-LYMPHOCYTES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EFFICIENT</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50839</publishedID><Artikel>A benchmark for comparison of cell tracking algorithms</Artikel><Journal>Bioinformatics</Journal><ABSTr>MOTIVATION: Automatic tracking of cells in multidimensional time-lapse fluorescence microscopy is an important task in many biomedical applications. A novel framework for objective evaluation of cell tracking algorithms has been established under the auspices of the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging 2013 Cell Tracking Challenge. In this article, we present the logistics, datasets, methods and results of the challenge and lay down the principles for future uses of this benchmark. RESULTS: The main contributions of the challenge include the creation of a comprehensive video dataset repository and the definition of objective measures for comparison and ranking of the algorithms. With this benchmark, six algorithms covering a variety of segmentation and tracking paradigms have been compared and ranked based on their performance on both synthetic and real datasets. Given the diversity of the datasets, we do not declare a single winner of the challenge. Instead, we present and discuss the results for each individual dataset separately. Availability and implementation: The challenge Web site (http://www.codesolorzano.com/celltrackingchallenge) provides access to the training and competition datasets, along with the ground truth of the training videos. It also provides access to Windows and Linux executable files of the evaluation software and most of the algorithms that competed in the challenge.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>30 (11), 1609-1617</Feld596><PubVol>30</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>1609</StrtPage><EndPage>1617</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Maska M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Ulman V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Svoboda D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Matula P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Matula P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Ederra C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Urbiola A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Espana T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Venkatesan S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Balak DM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Karas P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Bolckova T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Streitova M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Carthel C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Coraluppi S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Harder N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="16" name="Rohr K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="17" name="Magnusson KE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Jalden J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Blau HM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Dzyubachyk O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Krizek P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Hagen GM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Pastor-Escuredo D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Jimenez-Carretero D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Ledesma-Carbayo MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Munoz-Barrutia A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Meijering E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Kozubek M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Ortiz-de-Solorzano C" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24526711</PMID><DOI>10.1093/bioinformatics/btu080</DOI><KST>B080</KST><KEYWORD>NUCLEI</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>segmentation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMAGES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LINEAGE CONSTRUCTION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50840</publishedID><Artikel>Nutrient Patterns and Their Food Sources in an International Study Setting: Report from the EPIC Study</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Compared to food patterns, nutrient patterns have been rarely used particularly at international level. We studied, in the context of a multi-center study with heterogeneous data, the methodological challenges regarding pattern analyses. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We identified nutrient patterns from food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) Study and used 24-hour dietary recall (24-HDR) data to validate and describe the nutrient patterns and their related food sources. Associations between lifestyle factors and the nutrient patterns were also examined. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied on 23 nutrients derived from country-specific FFQ combining data from all EPIC centers (N = 477,312). Harmonized 24-HDRs available for a representative sample of the EPIC populations (N = 34,436) provided accurate mean group estimates of nutrients and foods by quintiles of pattern scores, presented graphically. An overall PCA combining all data captured a good proportion of the variance explained in each EPIC center. Four nutrient patterns were identified explaining 67% of the total variance: Principle component (PC) 1 was characterized by a high contribution of nutrients from plant food sources and a low contribution of nutrients from animal food sources; PC2 by a high contribution of micro-nutrients and proteins; PC3 was characterized by polyunsaturated fatty acids and vitamin D; PC4 was characterized by calcium, proteins, riboflavin, and phosphorus. The nutrients with high loadings on a particular pattern as derived from country-specific FFQ also showed high deviations in their mean EPIC intakes by quintiles of pattern scores when estimated from 24-HDR. Center and energy intake explained most of the variability in pattern scores. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The use of 24-HDR enabled internal validation and facilitated the interpretation of the nutrient patterns derived from FFQs in term of food sources. These outcomes open research opportunities and perspectives of using nutrient patterns in future studies particularly at international level.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (6), e98647-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>e98647</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Moskal A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Pisa PT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Ferrari P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Byrnes G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Freisling H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Boutron-Ruault MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Cadeau C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Nailler L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Wendt A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Kuehn T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Buijsse B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Halkjaer J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Dahm CC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Chiuve SE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Quiros JR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Buckland G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Molina-Montes E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Amiano P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Huerta Castano JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Gurrea AB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Lentjes MA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Key TJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Romaguera D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Vergnaud AC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Bamia C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Orfanos P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Palli D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Pala V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Sacerdote C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="de Magistris MS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Ocke MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Beulens JW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Ericson U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Drake I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Nilsson LM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Winkvist A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Hjartaker A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="44" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="45" name="Slimani N" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24901309</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0098647</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>EXPLORATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OLDER EUROPEANS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EUROPEAN COUNTRIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>dietary patterns</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LARYNGEAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BREAST-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GASTRIC-CANCER</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50844</publishedID><Artikel>No major role for periconceptional folic acid use and its interaction with the MTHFR C677T polymorphism in the etiology of congenital anorectal malformations</Artikel><Journal>Birth Defects Research / A, Clinical Molecular Teratology</Journal><ABSTr>Background: Both genetic and nongenetic factors are suggested to be involved in the etiology of congenital anorectal malformations (ARM). Maternal periconceptional use of folic acid supplements were inconsistently suggested to play a role in the prevention of ARM. Therefore, we investigated independent associations and interactions of maternal periconceptional folic acid supplement use and the infant and maternal MTHFR (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) C677T polymorphisms with the risk of ARM and subgroups of ARM. Methods: A case-control study was conducted among 371 nonsyndromic ARM cases and 714 population-based controls born between 1990 and 2012 using maternal questionnaires and DNA samples from mother and child. Cases were treated for ARM at departments of Pediatric Surgery of the Radboud university medical center, Sophia Children's Hospital-Erasmus MC Rotterdam, and the University Medical Center Groningen in The Netherlands and hospitals throughout Germany. Results: No association with folic acid use was present (odds ratio = 1.1; 95% confidence interval: 0.8-1.4) for ARM as a group. Infant and maternal MTHFR C677T polymorphisms were weakly associated with isolated ARM in particular. Lack of folic acid supplement use in combination with infants or mothers carrying the MTHFR C677T polymorphism did not seem to increase the risk of ARM or subgroups of ARM. The relative excess risks due to interaction did not clearly indicate interaction on an additive scale either. Conclusion: This first study investigating interactions between periconceptional folic acid supplement use and infant and maternal MTHFR C677T polymorphisms in the etiology of ARM did not provide evidence for a role of this gene-environment interaction.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>100 (6), 483-492</Feld596><PubVol>100</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>483</StrtPage><EndPage>492</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Wijers CH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="de Blaauw I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Zwink N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Draaken M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="van der Zanden LF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Brunner HG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Brooks AS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Hofstra RM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Sloots CE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Broens PM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Wijnen MH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Ludwig M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Jenetzky E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Reutter H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Marcelis CL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Roeleveld N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="van Rooij IA" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24841934</PMID><DOI>10.1002/bdra.23256</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>RISK-FACTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FOLATE INTAKE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEURAL-TUBE DEFECTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMPERFORATE ANUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METHYLENETETRAHYDROFOLATE REDUCTASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENETIC SELECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNIQUES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STRUCTURAL BIRTH-DEFECTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MTHFR 677C-GREATER-THAN-T</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEART-DEFECTS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50854</publishedID><Artikel>Network topology-based detection of differential gene regulation and regulatory switches in cell metabolism and signaling</Artikel><Journal>BMC Systems Biology</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Common approaches to pathway analysis treat pathways merely as lists of genes disregarding their topological structures, that is, ignoring the genes' interactions on which a pathway's cellular function depends. In contrast, PathWave has been developed for the analysis of high-throughput gene expression data that explicitly takes the topology of networks into account to identify both global dysregulation of and localized (switch-like) regulatory shifts within metabolic and signaling pathways. For this purpose, it applies adjusted wavelet transforms on optimized 2D grid representations of curated pathway maps. RESULTS: Here, we present the new version of PathWave with several substantial improvements including a new method for optimally mapping pathway networks unto compact 2D lattice grids, a more flexible and user-friendly interface, and pre-arranged 2D grid representations. These pathway representations are assembled for several species now comprising H. sapiens, M. musculus, D. melanogaster, D. rerio, C. elegans, and E. coli. We show that PathWave is more sensitive than common approaches and apply it to RNA-seq expression data, identifying crucial metabolic pathways in lung adenocarcinoma, as well as microarray expression data, identifying pathways involved in longevity of Drosophila. CONCLUSIONS: PathWave is a generic method for pathway analysis complementing established tools like GSEA, and the update comprises efficient new features. In contrast to the tested commonly applied approaches which do not take network topology into account, PathWave enables identifying pathways that are either known be involved in or very likely associated with such diverse conditions as human lung cancer or aging of D. melanogaster.

To address the questions as to what are the elicitors of a disrupted clock in cancer, we applied a systems biology approach to correlate experimental, bioinformatics and modelling data from several cell line models for colorectal and skin cancer. We found strong and weak circadian oscillators within the same type of cancer and identified a set of genes, which allows the discrimination between the two oscillator-types. Among those genes are IFNGR2, PITX2, RFWD2, PPARgamma, LOXL2, Rab6 and SPARC, all involved in cancer-related pathways. Using a bioinformatics approach, we extended the core-clock network and present its interconnection to the discriminative set of genes. Interestingly, such gene signatures link the clock to oncogenic pathways like the RAS/MAPK pathway. To investigate the potential impact of the RAS/MAPK pathway - a major driver of colorectal carcinogenesis - on the circadian clock, we used a computational model which predicted that perturbation of BMAL1-mediated transcription can generate the circadian phenotypes similar to those observed in metastatic cell lines. Using an inducible RAS expression system, we show that overexpression of RAS disrupts the circadian clock and leads to an increase of the circadian period while RAS inhibition causes a shortening of period length, as predicted by our mathematical simulations. Together, our data demonstrate that perturbations induced by a single oncogene are sufficient to deregulate the mammalian circadian clock.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>10 (5), e1004338-</Feld596><PubVol>10</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>e1004338</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Relogio A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Thomas P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Medina-Perez P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Reischl S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Bervoets S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Gloc E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Riemer P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Mang-Fatehi S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Maier B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Schaefer R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Leser U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Herzel H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Kramer A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Sers C" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24875049</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pgen.1004338</DOI><KST>L201</KST><KEYWORD>TUMOR PROGRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REGULATORY ELEMENTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL-CYCLE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METABOLISM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RHYTHMS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA-DAMAGE RESPONSE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50856</publishedID><Artikel>N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor blockade is neuroprotective in experimental autoimmune optic neuritis</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology</Journal><ABSTr>Optic neuritis is a common clinical manifestation of the chronic inflammatory CNS disease multiple sclerosis that can result in persistent visual impairment caused by degeneration of optic nerve axons and apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Using a model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis with optic neuritis (Brown Norway rats), we show that administration of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists memantine or MK801 results in RGC protection, axon protection, and reduced demyelination of optic nerves. Calcium imaging revealed that RGC responses to glutamate stimulation predominantly occurred via NMDA receptors and were inhibited by memantine in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, oligodendrocytes were mainly responsive through the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid/kainate receptor. This suggests that NMDA receptor blockade protected RGCs directly and that the protection was independent of effects on oligodendrocytes. Moreover, increased RGC survival was observed before the onset of optic nerve demyelination--when RGC degeneration had already started. These results indicate an important pathophysiologic role for NMDA receptor-mediated glutamate toxicity during the induction phase of this disease model and highlight a potential target for therapeutic neuroprotection in human optic neuritis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>73 (6), 507-518</Feld596><PubVol>73</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>507</StrtPage><EndPage>518</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Suhs KW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Fairless R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Williams SK" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Heine K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Cavalie A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Diem R" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24806299</PMID><DOI>10.1097/NEN.0000000000000073</DOI><KST>G370</KST><KEYWORD>NMDA RECEPTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RAT MODEL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPERIMENTAL ALLERGIC ENCEPHALOMYELITIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AXONAL LOSS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CNS INFLAMMATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEUROLOGICAL DEFICITS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEURONAL APOPTOSIS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>50857</publishedID><Artikel>Resistance mechanisms for the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib</Artikel><Journal>New England Journal of Medicine</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Ibrutinib is an irreversible inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) and is effective in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Resistance to irreversible kinase inhibitors and resistance associated with BTK inhibition have not been characterized. Although only a small proportion of patients have had a relapse during ibrutinib therapy, an understanding of resistance mechanisms is important. We evaluated patients with relapsed disease to identify mutations that may mediate ibrutinib resistance. METHODS: We performed whole-exome sequencing at baseline and the time of relapse on samples from six patients with acquired resistance to ibrutinib therapy. We then performed functional analysis of identified mutations. In addition, we performed Ion Torrent sequencing for identified resistance mutations on samples from nine patients with prolonged lymphocytosis. RESULTS: We identified a cysteine-to-serine mutation in BTK at the binding site of ibrutinib in five patients and identified three distinct mutations in PLCgamma2 in two patients. Functional analysis showed that the C481S mutation of BTK results in a protein that is only reversibly inhibited by ibrutinib. The R665W and L845F mutations in PLCgamma2 are both potentially gain-of-function mutations that lead to autonomous B-cell-receptor activity. These mutations were not found in any of the patients with prolonged lymphocytosis who were taking ibrutinib. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance to the irreversible BTK inhibitor ibrutinib often involves mutation of a cysteine residue where ibrutinib binding occurs. This finding, combined with two additional mutations in PLCgamma2 that are immediately downstream of BTK, underscores the importance of the B-cell-receptor pathway in the mechanism of action of ibrutinib in CLL.

We conducted a genome-wide association study of CRC in East Asians with 14,963 cases and 31,945 controls and identified 6 new loci associated with CRC risk (P = 3.42 x 10(-8) to 9.22 x 10(-21)) at 10q22.3, 10q25.2, 11q12.2, 12p13.31, 17p13.3 and 19q13.2. Two of these loci map to genes (TCF7L2 and TGFB1) with established roles in colorectal tumorigenesis. Four other loci are located in or near genes involved in transcriptional regulation (ZMIZ1), genome maintenance (FEN1), fatty acid metabolism (FADS1 and FADS2), cancer cell motility and metastasis (CD9), and cell growth and differentiation (NXN). We also found suggestive evidence for three additional loci associated with CRC risk near genome-wide significance at 8q24.11, 10q21.1 and 10q24.2. Furthermore, we replicated 22 previously reported CRC-associated loci. Our study provides insights into the genetic basis of CRC and suggests the involvement of new biological pathways.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>46 (6), 533-542</Feld596><PubVol>46</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>533</StrtPage><EndPage>542</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Zhang B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Jia WH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Matsuda K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kweon SS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Matsuo K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Xiang YB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Shin A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Jee SH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Kim DH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Cai Q" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Long J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Shi J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Wen W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Yang G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Zhang Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Li C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Li B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Guo Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Ren Z" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Ji BT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Pan ZZ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Takahashi A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Shin MH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Matsuda F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Gao YT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Oh JH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Kim S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Ahn YO" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Chan AT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Chang-Claude J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="30" name="Slattery ML" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Gruber SB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Schumacher FR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Stenzel SL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Casey G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Kim HR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Jeong JY" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Park JW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Li HL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Hosono S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Cho SH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Kubo M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Shu XO" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO)*" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="44" name="*Authors on behalf of the DACHS study: Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="45" name="Chang-Claude J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="46" name="Hoffmeister M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="47" name="Zeng YX" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="48" name="Zheng W" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24836286</PMID><DOI>10.1038/ng.2985</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL-GROWTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>susceptibility loci</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METAANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLON-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BREAST-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VARIANTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LYMPHOTOXIN-BETA-RECEPTOR</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51208</publishedID><Artikel>RARA fusion genes in acute promyelocytic leukemia: a review</Artikel><Journal>Expert Review of Hematology</Journal><ABSTr>The t(15;17)(q24;q21), generating a PML-RARA fusion gene, is the hallmark of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). At present, eight other genes fusing with RARA have been identified. The resulting fusion proteins retain domains of the RARA protein allowing binding to retinoic acid response elements (RARE) and dimerization with the retinoid X receptor protein (RXRA). They participate in protein-protein interactions, associating with RXRA to form hetero-oligomeric complexes that can bind to RARE. They have a dominant-negative effect on wild-type RARA/RXRA transcriptional activity. Moreover, RARA fusion proteins can homodimerize, conferring the ability to regulate an expanded repertoire of genes normally not affected by RARA. RARA fusion proteins behave as potent transcriptional repressors of retinoic acid signalling, inducing a differentiation blockage at the promyelocyte stage which can be overcome with therapeutic doses of ATRA or arsenic trioxide. However, resistance to these two drugs is a major problem, which necessitates development of new therapies.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>7 (3), 347-357</Feld596><PubVol>7</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>347</StrtPage><EndPage>357</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="De Braekeleer E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Douet-Guilbert N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="De Braekeleer M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24720386</PMID><DOI>10.1586/17474086.2014.903794</DOI><KST>A010</KST><KEYWORD>IDIOPATHIC HYPEREOSINOPHILIC SYNDROME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PML/RAR-ALPHA-PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ZINC-FINGER GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VARIANT TRANSLOCATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POLYMERASE-CHAIN-REACTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MESSENGER-RNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACUTE MYELOID-LEUKEMIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ARSENIC TRIOXIDE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIGAND-BINDING DOMAIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RETINOIC ACID RECEPTOR</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51209</publishedID><Artikel>The hallmarks of fibroblast ageing</Artikel><Journal>Mechanisms of Ageing and Development</Journal><ABSTr>Ageing is influenced by the intrinsic disposition delineating what is maximally possible and extrinsic factors determining how that frame is individually exploited. Intrinsic and extrinsic ageing processes act on the dermis, a post-mitotic skin compartment mainly consisting of extracellular matrix and fibroblasts. Dermal fibroblasts are long-lived cells constantly undergoing damage accumulation and (mal-)adaptation, thus constituting a powerful indicator system for human ageing. Here, we use the systematic of ubiquitous hallmarks of ageing (Lopez-Otin et al., 2013, Cell 153) to categorise the available knowledge regarding dermal fibroblast ageing. We discriminate processes inducible in culture from phenomena apparent in skin biopsies or primary cells from old donors, coming to the following conclusions: (i) Fibroblasts aged in culture exhibit most of the established, ubiquitous hallmarks of ageing. (ii) Not all of these hallmarks have been detected or investigated in fibroblasts aged in situ (in the skin). (iii) Dermal fibroblasts aged in vitro and in vivo exhibit additional features currently not considered ubiquitous hallmarks of ageing. (iv) The ageing process of dermal fibroblasts in their physiological tissue environment has only been partially elucidated, although these cells have been a preferred model of cell ageing in vitro for decades.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>138 (), 26-44</Feld596><PubVol>138</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>26</StrtPage><EndPage>44</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Tigges J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Krutmann J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Fritsche E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Haendeler J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schaal H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Fischer JW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Kalfalah F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Reinke H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Reifenberger G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Stuhler K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Ventura N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Gundermann S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Boukamp P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Boege F" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24686308</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.mad.2014.03.004</DOI><KST>A110</KST><KEYWORD>OXYGEN SPECIES PRODUCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA-DAMAGE-RESPONSE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN-DIPLOID FIBROBLASTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INDUCED PREMATURE SENESCENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN DERMAL FIBROBLASTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPIDERMAL-GROWTH-FACTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUTCHINSON-GILFORD-PROGERIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SKIN IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MAMMALIAN CIRCADIAN OSCILLATORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ELEGANS MITOCHONDRIAL MUTANTS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51222</publishedID><Artikel>Skin tumors with matrical differentiation: lessons from hair keratins, beta-catenin and PHLDA-1 expression</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Cutaneous Pathology</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Pilomatricomas are tumors that emulate the differentiation of matrix cells of the hair follicle, showing cortical differentiation, with sequential expression of K35 and K31 keratins. Beta-catenin gene is frequently mutated in pilomatricoma, leading to beta-catenin nuclear accumulation, and to downstream expression of LEF1. Skin matrical tumors other than pilomatricoma are very rare, and comprise purely matrical tumors and focally matrical tumors. We aimed at studying cortical differentiation, beta-catenin pathway and expression of the follicular stem-cell marker PHLDA1 in a series of matrical tumors other than pilomatricoma. METHODS: In 36 prospectively collected tumors, K31, K35, CK17, LEF1, HOXC13, beta-catenin and PHLDA1 expressions were evaluated. Five pilomatricomas were used as controls. RESULTS: In 18 purely matrical tumors (11 matrical carcinomas, 4 melanocytic matricomas, 3 matricomas) and 18 focally matrical tumors (11 basal cell carcinomas, 3 trichoepithelioma/trichoblastomas, 4 others), sequential K35, HOXC13 and K31 expressions were found, indicating cortical differentiation. Germinative matrix cells were always CK17-, and showed nuclear beta-catenin accumulation, with LEF1 and PHLDA1 expressions. CONCLUSIONS: Nuclear beta-catenin and LEF1 expression was highly conserved in matrical tumors, and suggested a common tumorigenesis driven by Wnt pathway activation. PHLDA1 was consistently expressed in matrical tumors and in areas of matrical differentiation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>41 (5), 427-436</Feld596><PubVol>41</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>427</StrtPage><EndPage>436</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Battistella M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Carlson JA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Osio A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Langbein L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Cribier B" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24673383</PMID><DOI>10.1111/cup.12313</DOI><KST>A110</KST><KEYWORD>APOCRINE MIXED TUMOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MELANOCYTIC MATRICOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TDAG51</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRICHOEPITHELIOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PILOMATRICOMAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HYPERPLASIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BASAL-CELL CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENTITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MARKER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTATIONS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51223</publishedID><Artikel>Identification of novel SHOX target genes in the developing limb using a transgenic mouse model</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>Deficiency of the human short stature homeobox-containing gene (SHOX) has been identified in several disorders characterized by reduced height and skeletal anomalies such as Turner syndrome, Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis and Langer mesomelic dysplasia as well as isolated short stature. SHOX acts as a transcription factor during limb development and is expressed in chondrocytes of the growth plates. Although highly conserved in vertebrates, rodents lack a SHOX orthologue. This offers the unique opportunity to analyze the effects of human SHOX expression in transgenic mice. We have generated a mouse expressing the human SHOXa cDNA under the control of a murine Col2a1 promoter and enhancer (Tg(Col2a1-SHOX)). SHOX and marker gene expression as well as skeletal phenotypes were characterized in two transgenic lines. No significant skeletal anomalies were found in transgenic compared to wildtype mice. Quantitative and in situ hybridization analyses revealed that Tg(Col2a1-SHOX), however, affected extracellular matrix gene expression during early limb development, suggesting a role for SHOX in growth plate assembly and extracellular matrix composition during long bone development. For instance, we could show that the connective tissue growth factor gene Ctgf, a gene involved in chondrogenic and angiogenic differentiation, is transcriptionally regulated by SHOX in transgenic mice. This finding was confirmed in human NHDF and U2OS cells and chicken micromass culture, demonstrating the value of the SHOX-transgenic mouse for the characterization of SHOX-dependent genes and pathways in early limb development.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (6), e98543-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>e98543</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Beiser KU" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Glaser A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kleinschmidt K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Scholl I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Roth R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Li L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Gretz N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Mechtersheimer G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Karperien M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Marchini A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Richter W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Rappold GA" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24887312</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0098543</DOI><KST>F010</KST><KEYWORD>PHENOTYPES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TURNER-SYNDROME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IDIOPATHIC SHORT STATURE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LERI-WEILL DYSCHONDROSTEOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HOMEOBOX GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DEFICIENCY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHONDROCYTE PROLIFERATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BONE-DEVELOPMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH-PLATE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51224</publishedID><Artikel>The PP2A phosphatase regulatory subunit B56gamma mediates suppression of T-cell receptor (TCR)-induced nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activity</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Biological Chemistry</Journal><ABSTr>NF-kappaB is an important transcription factor in the immune system and aberrant NF-kappaB activity contributes to malignant diseases and autoimmunity. In T cells, NF-kappaB is activated upon TCR stimulation and signal transduction to NF-kappaB activation is triggered by a cascade of phosphorylation events. However, fine-tuning and termination of TCR signaling is only partially understood. Phosphatases oppose the role of kinases by removing phosphate moieties. The catalytic activity of the protein phosphatase PP2A has been implicated in the regulation of NF-kappaB. PP2A acts in trimeric complexes, in which the catalytic subunit is promiscuous and the regulatory subunit confers substrate specificity. To understand and eventually target NF-kappaB-specific PP2A functions it is essential to define the regulatory PP2A subunit involved. So far, the regulatory PP2A subunit that mediates NF-kappaB suppression in T cells remained undefined. By performing a siRNA screen in Jurkat T cells harboring a NF-kappaB-responsive luciferase reporter, we identified the PP2A regulatory subunit B56gamma as negative regulator of NF-kappaB in TCR signaling. B56gamma was strongly upregulated upon primary human T cell activation and B56gamma silencing induced increased IkappaB kinase (IKK) and IkappaBalpha phosphorylation upon TCR stimulation. B56gamma silencing enhanced NF-kappaB activity, resulting in increased NF-kappaB target gene expression including the T cell cytokine IL-2. In addition, T cell proliferation was increased upon B56gamma silencing. These data help to understand the physiology of PP2A function in T cells and the pathophysiology of diseases involving PP2A and NF-kappaB.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>289 (21), 14996-15004</Feld596><PubVol>289</PubVol><PubIss>21</PubIss><StrtPage>14996</StrtPage><EndPage>15004</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Breuer R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Becker MS" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Brechmann M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Mock T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Arnold R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Krammer PH" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24719332</PMID><DOI>10.1074/jbc.M113.533547</DOI><KST>D030</KST><KEYWORD>LYMPHOID-TISSUE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MALT1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PP2A</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TYROSINE-PHOSPHATASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALPHA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IDENTIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LYMPHOCYTES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OKADAIC ACID</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51225</publishedID><Artikel>RNA and Imidazoquinolines Are Sensed by Distinct TLR7/8 Ectodomain Sites Resulting in Functionally Disparate Signaling Events</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Immunology</Journal><ABSTr>TLRs 7 and 8 are pattern recognition receptors controlling antiviral host defense or autoimmune diseases. Apart from foreign and host RNA, synthetic RNA oligoribonucleotides (ORN) or small molecules of the imidazoquinoline family activate TLR7 and 8 and are being developed as therapeutic agonists. The structure-function relationships for RNA ORN and imidazoquinoline sensing and consequent downstream signaling by human TLR7 and TLR8 are unknown. Proteome- and genome-wide analyses in primary human monocyte-derived dendritic cells here showed that TLR8 sensing of RNA ORN versus imidazoquinoline translates to ligand-specific differential phosphorylation and transcriptional events. In addition, TLR7 and 8 ectodomains were found to discriminate between RNA ORN and imidazoquinolines by overlapping and nonoverlapping recognition sites to which murine loss-of-function mutations and human naturally occurring hyporesponsive polymorphisms map. Our data suggest TLR7 and TLR8 can signal in two different "modes" depending on the class of ligand. Considering RNA ORN and imidazoquinolines have been regarded as functionally interchangeable, our study highlights important functional incongruities whose understanding will be important for developing TLR7 or 8 therapeutics with desirable effector and safety profiles for in vivo application.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>192 (12), 5963-5973</Feld596><PubVol>192</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>5963</StrtPage><EndPage>5973</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Colak E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Leslie A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Zausmer K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Khatamzas E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kubarenko AV" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Pichulik T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Klimosch SN" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Mayer A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Siggs O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Hector A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Fischer R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Klesser B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Rautanen A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Frank M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="14" name="Hill AV" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Manoury B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Beutler B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Hartl D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Simmons A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Weber AN" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24813206</PMID><DOI>10.4049/jimmunol.1303058</DOI><KST>W500</KST><KEYWORD>LIGANDS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DOUBLE-STRANDED-RNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TOLL-LIKE RECEPTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OLIGODEOXYNUCLEOTIDES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TLR9</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PLASMACYTOID DENDRITIC CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RESPONSIVENESS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEUTROPHILS EXPRESS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTERFERON-BETA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51226</publishedID><Artikel>An RNAi screen identifies KIF15 as a novel regulator of the endocytic trafficking of integrin</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Cell Science</Journal><ABSTr>alpha2beta1 integrin is one of the most important collagen-binding receptors, and it has been implicated in numerous thrombotic and immune diseases. alpha2beta1 integrin is a potent tumour suppressor, and its downregulation is associated with increased metastasis and poor prognosis in breast cancer. Currently, very little is known about the mechanism that regulates the cell-surface expression and trafficking of alpha2beta1 integrin. Here, using a quantitative fluorescence-microscopy-based RNAi assay, we investigated the impact of 386 cytoskeleton-associated or -regulatory genes on alpha2 integrin endocytosis and found that 122 of these affected the intracellular accumulation of alpha2 integrin. Of these, 83 were found to be putative regulators of alpha2 integrin trafficking and/or expression, with no observed effect on the internalization of epidermal growth factor (EGF) or transferrin. Further interrogation and validation of the siRNA screen revealed a role for KIF15, a microtubule-based molecular motor, as a significant inhibitor of the endocytic trafficking of alpha2 integrin. Our data suggest a novel role for KIF15 in mediating plasma membrane localization of the alternative clathrin adaptor Dab2, thus impinging on pathways that regulate alpha2 integrin internalization.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>127 (Pt 11), 2433-2447</Feld596><PubVol>127</PubVol><PubIss>Pt 11</PubIss><StrtPage>2433</StrtPage><EndPage>2447</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Eskova A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Knapp B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Matelska D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Reusing S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Arjonen A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Lisauskas T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Pepperkok R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Russell R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Eils R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Ivaska J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Kaderali L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Erfle H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Starkuviene V" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24659801</PMID><DOI>10.1242/jcs.137281</DOI><KST>B080</KST><KEYWORD>MOTOR PROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LYSOSOMAL DEGRADATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALPHA-5-BETA-1 INTEGRIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEOMIC ANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPIDERMAL-GROWTH-FACTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIN CYTOSKELETON</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECEPTOR-MEDIATED ENDOCYTOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COATED PITS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL-MIGRATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51227</publishedID><Artikel>Non-enhanced t1-weighted liver vessel imaging at 7 tesla</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>OBJECTIVES: Aim of the study was to assess the feasibility and to compare three non-enhanced T1-weighted (w) sequences for liver vessel imaging at 7 Tesla (T). MATERIAL AND METHODS: 12 healthy volunteers were examined on a 7 T whole-body MR-system. The following non-enhanced sequences were acquired: T1w 2D FLASH, T1w 3D FLASH and Time of flight (TOF)-MRA. Qualitative image analysis was performed by two radiologists including over all image quality as well as vessel delineation of the liver arteries, liver veins and portal vein and the presence of artifacts using a five-point scale (5 = excellent vessel delineation to 1 = non-diagnostic). Contrast ratios (CR), SNR und CNR of the above named vessels in correlation to adjacent liver tissue were calculated for quantitative assessment. For statistical analysis, a Wilcoxon Rank Test was applied. RESULTS: All three sequences provided a homogenous hyperintense delineation of the assessed liver vessels. Qualitative image analysis demonstrated the superiority of TOF-MRA, providing best overall image quality (TOF 4.17, 2D FLASH 3.42, 3D FLASH 3.46; p&lt;0.01) as well as highest image quality values for all analyzed liver vessel segments. TOF-MRA was least impaired by B1 inhomogeneity (4.13) and susceptibility artifacts (4.63) out of all three sequences (p&lt;0.01). Quantitative image analysis confirmed the superiority of TOF MRA showing significant higher CR values for all liver vessels (e.g. right hepatic artery TOF 0.47, 2D FLASH 0.09, 3D FLASH 0.11 with p = 0.02 and 0.01, respectively). Providing the lowest standard deviation in noise, TOF showed highest values for SNR and CNR. CONCLUSIONS: Non-enhanced T1w imaging in general and TOF MRA in particular, appear to be promising techniques for high quality non-enhanced liver vessel assessment at 7 T.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (6), e97465-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>e97465</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Fischer A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Kraff O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Maderwald S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Beiderwellen K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Ladd ME" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Forsting M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Lauenstein TC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Umutlu L" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24887206</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0097465</DOI><KST>E020</KST><KEYWORD>CT ANGIOGRAPHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DONORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FAST SPIN-ECHO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEPHROGENIC SYSTEMIC FIBROSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PRECESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INITIAL-EXPERIENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENHANCED MR-ANGIOGRAPHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANATOMY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEPATIC VASCULATURE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51229</publishedID><Artikel>Revealing the role of SGK1 in the dynamics of medulloblastoma using a mathematical model</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Theoretical Biology</Journal><ABSTr>Deregulation of signaling pathways and subsequent abnormal interactions of downstream genes very often results in carcinogenesis. In this paper, we propose a two-compartment model describing intricate dynamics of the target genes of the Wnt signaling pathway in medulloblastoma. The system of nine nonlinear ordinary differential equations accounts for the formation and dissociation of complexes as well as for the transcription, translation and transport between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. We focus on the interplay between MYC and SGK1 (serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1), which are the products of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, and GSK3beta (glycogen synthase kinase). Numerical simulations of the model solutions yield a better understanding of the process and indicate the importance of the SGK1 gene in the development of medulloblastoma, which has been confirmed in our recent experiments. The model is calibrated based on the gene expression microarray data for two types of medulloblastoma, characterized by monosomy and trisomy of chromosome 6q to highlight the difference between diagnoses.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>354 (), 105-12</Feld596><PubVol>354</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>105</StrtPage><EndPage>12</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kawka J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Sturm D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Pleier S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Pfister S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Marciniak-Czochra A" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24685888</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.jtbi.2014.03.028</DOI><KST>B062</KST><KEYWORD>MYC</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MARKER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISTINCT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>transcription</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>APOPTOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHWAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>carcinoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THERAPY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51230</publishedID><Artikel>PADI4 acts as a coactivator of Tal1 by counteracting repressive histone arginine methylation</Artikel><Journal>Nature Communications</Journal><ABSTr>The transcription factor Tal1 is a critical activator or repressor of gene expression in hematopoiesis and leukaemia. The mechanism by which Tal1 differentially influences transcription of distinct genes is not fully understood. Here we show that Tal1 interacts with the peptidylarginine deiminase IV (PADI4). We demonstrate that PADI4 can act as an epigenetic coactivator through influencing H3R2me2a. At the Tal1/PADI4 target gene IL6ST the repressive H3R2me2a mark triggered by PRMT6 is counteracted by PADI4, which augments the active H3K4me3 mark and thus increases IL6ST expression. In contrast, at the CTCF promoter PADI4 acts as a repressor. We propose that the influence of PADI4 on IL6ST transcription plays a role in the control of IL6ST expression during lineage differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. These results open the possibility to pharmacologically influence Tal1 in leukaemia.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>5 (), Art. Nr.: 3995-</Feld596><PubVol>5</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>Art.

The flexibility of Dpp signaling is clearly evident in epithelial cells of the Drosophila wing imaginal disc. During larval stages of development, Dpp functions as a morphogen, patterning the wing developmental field and stimulating tissue growth. A short time later, however, as wing-epithelial cells exit the cell cycle and begin to differentiate, Dpp is a critical determinant of vein-cell fate. It is likely that the Dpp signaling pathway regulates different sets of target genes at these two developmental time points. Results: To identify mechanisms that temporally control the transcriptional output of Dpp signaling in this system, we have taken a gene expression profiling approach. We identified genes affected by Dpp signaling at late larval or early pupal developmental time points, thereby identifying patterning- and differentiation-specific downstream targets, respectively. Conclusions: Analysis of target genes and transcription factor binding sites associated with these groups of genes revealed potential mechanisms by which target-gene specificity of the Dpp signaling pathway is temporally regulated. In addition, this approach revealed novel mechanisms by which Dpp affects the cellular differentiation of wing-veins.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>243 (6), 818-832</Feld596><PubVol>243</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>818</StrtPage><EndPage>832</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="O'Keefe,D.D."

Here we investigated the role of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase/v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) axis in the regulation of MDM4 levels in HCC. The activity of MDM4 and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway was modulated in human HCC cell lines by way of silencing and overexpression experiments. Expression of main pathway components was analyzed in an AKT mouse model and human HCCs. MDM4 inhibition resulted in growth restraint of HCC cell lines both in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of the PI3K-AKT and/or mTOR pathways lowered MDM4 protein levels in HCC cells and reactivated p53-dependent transcription. Deubiquitination by ubiquitin-specific protease 2a and AKT-mediated phosphorylation protected MDM4 from proteasomal degradation and increased its protein stability. The eukaryotic elongation factor 1A2 (EEF1A2) was identified as an upstream inducer of PI3K supporting MDM4 stabilization. Also, we detected MDM4 protein up-regulation in an AKT mouse model and a strong correlation between the expression of EEF1A2, activated/phosphorylated AKT, and MDM4 in human HCC (each rho &gt; 0.8, P &lt; 0.001). Noticeably, a strong activation of this cascade was associated with shorter patient survival. CONCLUSION: The EEF1A2/PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis promotes the protumorigenic stabilization of the MDM4 protooncogene in human HCC by way of a posttranscriptional mechanism. The activation level of the EEF1A2/PI3K/AKT/mTOR/MDM4 axis significantly influences the survival probability of HCC patients in vivo and may thus represent a promising molecular target.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>59 (5), 1886-1899</Feld596><PubVol>59</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>1886</StrtPage><EndPage>1899</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Pellegrino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Calvisi DF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Neumann O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kolluru V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Wesely J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Chen X" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Wang C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Wuestefeld T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Ladu S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Elgohary N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Bermejo JL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Radlwimmer B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Zornig M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Zender L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Dombrowski F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Evert M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Schirmacher P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Longerich T" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24285179</PMID><DOI>10.1002/hep.26954</DOI><KST>B060</KST><KEYWORD>INHIBITOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADVANCED SOLID TUMORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHOSPHORYLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IDENTIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSFORMATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA-DAMAGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DEGRADATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AKT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>P53-BINDING PROTEIN</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51233</publishedID><Artikel>Experimental investigations on carbon ion scanning radiography using a range telescope</Artikel><Journal>Physics in Medicine and Biology</Journal><ABSTr>Ion beams offer an excellent tumor-dose conformality due to their inverted depth-dose profile and finite range in tissue, the Bragg peak (BP). However, they introduce sensitivity to range uncertainties. Imaging techniques play an increasingly important role in ion beam therapy to support precise diagnosis and identification of the target volume at the planning stage as well as to ensure the correspondence between the planning and treatment situation at the actual irradiation. For the purpose of improved treatment quality, ion-based radiographic images could be acquired at the treatment site before or during treatment and be employed to monitor the patient positioning and to check the patient-specific ion range. This work presents the initial experimental investigations carried out to address the feasibility of carbon ion radiography at the Heidelberg ion therapy center using a prototype range telescope set-up and an active raster scanning ion beam delivery system. Bragg curves are measured with a stack of ionization chambers (IC) synchronously to the beam delivery. The position of the BP is extracted from the data by locating the channel of maximum current signal for each delivered beam. Each BP is associated to the lateral and vertical positions of the scanned raster point extrapolated from the beam monitor system to build up a radiography. The radiographic images are converted into water equivalent thickness (WET) based on two calibrations of the detector. Radiographies of two phantoms of different complexities are reconstructed and their image quality is analyzed. A novel method proposed to increase the nominal range resolution of the IC stack is applied to the carbon ion radiography of an Alderson head phantom. Moreover, an x-ray digitally reconstructed radiography of the same anthropomorphic head phantom is converted in WET through the clinically used ion range calibration curve and compared with the carbon ion radiography based on a gamma-index approach, yielding a good correspondence in terms of absolute WET within +/-3%, 3 mm distance-to-agreement and, 87% passing ratio. Imaging artifacts at interfaces within the irradiated phantom due to the finite size of the beam, resulting in multiple maxima, are addressed. Overall, this work demonstrates the feasibility of the prototype range telescope to acquire ion-based transmission imaging with a resolution of up to 0.8 mm WET.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>59 (12), 3041-3057</Feld596><PubVol>59</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>3041</StrtPage><EndPage>3057</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Rinaldi I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Brons S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Jaekel O" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Voss B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Parodi K" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24842455</PMID><DOI>10.1088/0031-9155/59/12/3041</DOI><KST>E040</KST><KEYWORD>PROTON COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>stopping power</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CT-HOUNSFIELD UNITS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DETECTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CALIBRATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATIENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RESOLUTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SYSTEM</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51235</publishedID><Artikel>PET/CT studies of multiple myeloma using (18) F-FDG and (18) F-NaF: comparison of distribution patterns and tracers' pharmacokinetics</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging</Journal><ABSTr>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this prospective study is to evaluate the combined use of fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ((18) F-FDG) and fluorine-18 sodium fluoride ((18) F-NaF) PET/CT in the skeletal assessment of patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and to compare the efficacy of these two PET tracers regarding detection of myeloma-indicative osseous lesions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study includes 60 patients with multiple myeloma (MM) diagnosed according to standard criteria. All patients underwent dynamic (dPET/CT) scanning of the pelvis as well as whole body PET/CT studies with both tracers. The interval between the two exams was one day. Sites of focal increased (18) F-FDG uptake were considered as highly suspicious of myelomatous involvement. The lesions detected on the (18) F-NaF PET/CT scans were then correlated with those detected on (18) F-FDG PET/CT, which served as a reference. Moreover, the (18) F-FDG PET/CT results were also correlated with the low-dose CT findings. The evaluation of dPET/CT studies was based on qualitative evaluation, SUV calculation, and quantitative analysis based on a 2-tissue compartment model and a non-compartmental approach. RESULTS: Whole body (18) F-FDG PET/CT revealed approximately 343 focal lesions while (18) F-NaF PET/CT revealed 135 MM-indicative lesions (39 % correlation). CT demonstrated 150 lesions that correlated with those in (18) F-FDG PET/CT (44 % correlation). Six patients demonstrated a diffuse pattern of disease with (18) F-FDG, while 15 of them had a mixed (diffuse and focal) pattern of skeletal (18) F-FDG uptake. A high number of degenerative, traumatic and arthritic disease lesions were detected with (18) F-NaF PET/CT. In three patients with multiple focal (18) F-FDG-uptake, (18) F-NaF PET/CT failed to demonstrate any bone lesion. The dPET/CT scanning of the pelvic area with (18) F-FDG and (18) F-NaF revealed 77 and 24 MM-indicative lesions, respectively. Kinetic analysis of (18) F-FDG revealed the following mean values: SUVaver = 5.1, k1 = 0.37 (1/min), k3 = 0.10 (1/min), VB = 0.06, influx = 0.04 (1/min), FD = 1.28; the respective values for (18) F-NaF were SUVaverage = 10.7, k1 = 0.25 (1/min), k3 = 0.34 (1/min), VB = 0.02, influx = 0.10 (1/min), FD = 1.37. Apart from the correlation between VB of (18) F-FDG and k1 of (18) F-NaF (r = 0.54), no other significant correlation was observed between the two tracers' kinetic parameters. We found a significant correlation between FD and SUVaverage (r = 0.93), FD and SUVmax (r = 0.80), FD and influx ( r = 0.85), as well as between influx and SUVaverage (r = 0.74) for (18) F-FDG. In (18) F-NaF we observed the most significant correlations between FD and SUVaverage (r = 0.97), FD and SUVmax (r = 0.87), and between influx and k1 (r = 0.72). CONCLUSION: The combined use of (18) F-FDG PET/CT and (18) F-NaF PET/CT provides different molecular information regarding the biological processes that take place in a MM osseous lesion. (18) F-FDG PET/CT proved to be a more specific biomarker than (18) F-NaF PET/CT in multiple myeloma skeletal assessment.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>41 (7), 1343-1353</Feld596><PubVol>41</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>1343</StrtPage><EndPage>1353</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Sachpekidis,C."

Standard treatment is transurethral resection. About 60% of the tumors will recur, however, and in part progress to become invasive. Therefore, surveillance cystoscopy is performed after resection. However, in the USA and Europe alone, about 54 000 new patients per year undergo repeated cystoscopies over several years, who do not experience recurrence. Analysing in a pilot study resected tumors from patients with (n = 19) and without local recurrence (n = 6) after a period of 5 years by means of an antibody microarray that targeted 724 cancer-related proteins, we identified 255 proteins with significantly differential abundance. Most are involved in the regulation and execution of apoptosis and cell proliferation. A multivariate classifier was constructed based on 20 proteins. It facilitates the prediction of recurrence with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 100%. As a measure of overall accuracy, the area under the curve value was found to be 91%. After validation in additional sample cohorts with a similarly long follow-up, such a signature could support decision making about the stringency of surveillance or even different treatment options.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>14 (11), 1333-1342</Feld596><PubVol>14</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>1333</StrtPage><EndPage>1342</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Srinivasan H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Allory Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Sill M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Vordos D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Alhamdani MS" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Radvanyi F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Hoheisel JD" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Schroeder C" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24610664</PMID><DOI>10.1002/pmic.201300320</DOI><KST>B070</KST><KST>C060</KST><KEYWORD>SELF-RENEWAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>tissue microarray</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>UROTHELIAL CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGNOSTIC-FACTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BREAST-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROSTATE-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EAU GUIDELINES</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51237</publishedID><Artikel>Systematic pathway enrichment analysis of a genome-wide association study on breast cancer survival reveals an influence of genes involved in cell adhesion and calcium signaling on the patients' clinical outcome</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) may help to understand the effects of genetic polymorphisms on breast cancer (BC) progression and survival. However, they give only a focused view, which cannot capture the tremendous complexity of this disease. Therefore, we investigated data from a previously conducted GWAS on BC survival for enriched pathways by different enrichment analysis tools using the two main annotation databases Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). The goal was to identify the functional categories (GO terms and KEGG pathways) that are consistently overrepresented in a statistically significant way in the list of genes generated from the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. The SNPs with allelic p-value cut-offs 0.005 and 0.01 were annotated to the genes by excluding or including a 20 kb up-and down-stream sequence of the genes and analyzed by six different tools. We identified eleven consistently enriched categories, the most significant ones relating to cell adhesion and calcium ion binding. Moreover, we investigated the similarity between our GWAS and the enrichment analyses of twelve published gene expression signatures for breast cancer prognosis. Five of them were commonly used and commercially available, five were based on different aspects of metastasis formation and two were developed from meta-analyses of published prognostic signatures. This comparison revealed similarities between our GWAS data and the general and the specific brain metastasis gene signatures as well as the Oncotype DX signature. As metastasis formation is a strong indicator of a patient's prognosis, this result reflects the survival aspect of the conducted GWAS and supports cell adhesion and calcium signaling as important pathways in cancer progression.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (6), e98229-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>e98229</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Woltmann A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Chen B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Lascorz J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Johansson R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Eyfjord JE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hamann U" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Manjer J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Enquist-Olsson K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Henriksson R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Herms S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Hoffmann P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Hemminki K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Lenner P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Foersti A" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24886783</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0098229</DOI><KST>C050</KST><KST>B072</KST><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>prognosis</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METASTASIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECURRENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SIGNATURE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51238</publishedID><Artikel>The self-disproportionation of the enantiomers (SDE) of methyl n-pentyl sulfoxide via achiral, gravity-driven column chromatography: a case study</Artikel><Journal>Organic and Biomolecular Chemistry</Journal><ABSTr>This work explores the self-disproportionation of enantiomers (SDE) of chiral sulfoxides via achiral, gravity-driven column chromatography using methyl n-pentyl sulfoxide as a case study. A major finding of this work is the remarkable persistence and high magnitude of the SDE for the analyte. Thus, it is the first case where SDE is observed even in the presence of MeOH in the mobile phase. The study demonstrated the practical preparation, in line with theory, of enantiomerically pure (&gt;99.9% ee) samples of methyl n-pentyl sulfoxide starting from a sample of only modest ee (&lt;35%). Remarkably, it was found that the order of elution was inverted, i.e. enantiomerically depleted fractions preceded later eluting enantiomerically enriched ones, when the stationary phase was changed from silica gel to aluminum oxide. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first occurrence of inverted SDE behavior due solely to a change in the stationary phase. Aberrant SDE behavior was observed in that the ee did not always fall continuously during the progression of the chromatography, and this was attributed to the complexity of the system at hand which cannot be described in simple terms such as the formation only of homo- and heterochiral dimers based on a single interaction. The results nevertheless suggest that all compounds with a chiral sulfoxide moiety in their structure are likely to exhibit the SDE phenomenon and thus this work constitutes the first example of SDE predictability. Moreover, it could well be that optical purification based on the SDE phenomenon is a simple, convenient, and inexpensive method for the optical purification of this class of compounds with a high degree of proficiency.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>12 (26), 4738-4746</Feld596><PubVol>12</PubVol><PubIss>26</PubIss><StrtPage>4738</StrtPage><EndPage>4746</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Wzorek A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Klika KD" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Drabowicz J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Sato A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Acena JL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Soloshonok VA" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24873904</PMID><DOI>10.1039/c4ob00831f</DOI><KST>G404</KST><KEYWORD>DERIVATIVES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENRICHMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NON-RACEMIC MIXTURES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SILICA-GEL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OPTICAL PURIFICATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHASE CHROMATOGRAPHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STATIONARY-PHASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUBLIMATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHYTOALEXIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BINAPHTHOL</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51367</publishedID><Artikel>Establishment of hypoxia induction in an in vivo animal replacement model for experimental evaluation of pancreatic cancer</Artikel><Journal>Oncology Reports</Journal><ABSTr>Transplantation of tumor xenografts to fertilized chicken eggs is a promising animal replacement method, which has successfully been used for xenotransplantation of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) cells. PDA is characterized by a pronounced tumor hypoxia, which mediates aggressive growth, therapy resistance and cancer stem cell (CSC) features. For in vivo experimental evaluation of hypoxia-targeting therapeutic strategies, the xenografting of tumors to chicken eggs combined with the induction of hypoxia is necessary. However, the chicken embryos do not survive the conventional method of hypoxia induction by a gas mixture of 1% O2, 5% CO2, 94% N2, not even when hypoxia is applied for only 30 min. Therefore, we employed chemical induction of hypoxia by the hypoxia mimetic agent cobalt chloride (CoCl2). Whereas CoCl2 did not further increase tumor growth, it mediated the induction of carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) in the tumor xenografts and led to enhanced expression of the human CSC markers CD133, Sox2 and CD44. Side-effects in chicken embryos were not observed as evaluated by H&amp;E staining of embryo-derived liver sections and the determination of the embryo weight. These results suggest the successful induction of hypoxia in chicken eggs and xenografted tumors by CoCl2. For therapeutic intervention and as a control, we treated the eggs with the plant-derived anti-inflammatory agent triptolide, which recently showed promising effects toward hypoxia-induced tumor progression in experimental PDA. Triptolide abolished tumor growth and the CoCl2-induced hypoxic effects, without inducing obvious side-effects. Collectively, our data present a new in vivo animal replacement method for the successful induction of tumor hypoxia in PDA.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>32 (1), 153-158</Feld596><PubVol>32</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>153</StrtPage><EndPage>158</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Bauer N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Liu L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Aleksandrowicz E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Herr I" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24842335</PMID><DOI>10.3892/or.2014.3196</DOI><KST>G403</KST><KEYWORD>PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSITION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VEGF</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR-INITIATING CELLS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51368</publishedID><Artikel>Arsenic trioxide inhibits tumor cell growth in malignant rhabdoid tumors in vitro and in vivo by targeting overexpressed Gli1</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Rhabdoid tumors are highly aggressive tumors occurring in infants and very young children.

Therefore, we aimed to quantify the combined effects of genetic and lifestyle factors on risk of T2D in order to inform strategies for prevention. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The InterAct study includes 12,403 incident T2D cases and a representative sub-cohort of 16,154 individuals from a cohort of 340,234 European participants with 3.99 million person-years of follow-up. We studied the combined effects of an additive genetic T2D risk score and modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors using Prentice-weighted Cox regression and random effects meta-analysis methods. The effect of the genetic score was significantly greater in younger individuals (p for interaction = 1.20x10-4). Relative genetic risk (per standard deviation [4.4 risk alleles]) was also larger in participants who were leaner, both in terms of body mass index (p for interaction = 1.50x10-3) and waist circumference (p for interaction = 7.49x10-9). Examination of absolute risks by strata showed the importance of obesity for T2D risk. The 10-y cumulative incidence of T2D rose from 0.25% to 0.89% across extreme quartiles of the genetic score in normal weight individuals, compared to 4.22% to 7.99% in obese individuals. We detected no significant interactions between the genetic score and sex, diabetes family history, physical activity, or dietary habits assessed by a Mediterranean diet score. CONCLUSIONS: The relative effect of a T2D genetic risk score is greater in younger and leaner participants. However, this sub-group is at low absolute risk and would not be a logical target for preventive interventions. The high absolute risk associated with obesity at any level of genetic risk highlights the importance of universal rather than targeted approaches to lifestyle intervention.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>11 (5), e1001647-</Feld596><PubVol>11</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>e1001647</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Langenberg C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Sharp SJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Franks PW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Scott RA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Deloukas P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Forouhi NG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Froguel P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Groop LC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Hansen T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Palla L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Pedersen O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Schulze MB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Tormo MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Wheeler E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Agnoli C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Arriola L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Barricarte A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Clarke GM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Clavel-Chapelon F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Duell EJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Fagherazzi G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Kaaks R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="23" name="Kerrison ND" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Key TJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Kroger J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Lajous M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Morris AP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Navarro C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Nilsson PM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Palli D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Panico S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Quiros JR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Rolandsson O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Sacerdote C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Sanchez MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Slimani N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Spijkerman AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="van der A DL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="van der Schouw YT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Barroso I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="44" name="McCarthy MI" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="45" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="46" name="Wareham NJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24845081</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pmed.1001647</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>RISK-FACTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VARIANTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Mediterranean diet</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>10 EUROPEAN COUNTRIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMPAIRED GLUCOSE-TOLERANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PREVENTION PROGRAM</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51370</publishedID><Artikel>Novel role of nuclear receptor Rev-erbalpha in hepatic stellate cell activation: potential therapeutic target for liver injury</Artikel><Journal>Hepatology</Journal><ABSTr>Hepatic stellate cell (HSC) transdifferentiation from a quiescent, adipocyte-like cell to a highly secretory and contractile myofibroblast-like phenotype contributes to negative pathological consequences, including fibrosis/cirrhosis with portal hypertension (PH). Antiadipogenic mechanisms have been shown to underlie activation of HSCs. We examined the role of heme-sensing nuclear receptor Rev-erbalpha, a transcriptional repressor involved in metabolic and circadian regulation known to promote adipogenesis in preadipocytes, in HSC transdifferentiation. We discovered that Rev-erbalpha protein was up-regulated in activated HSCs and injured livers; however, transcriptional repressor activity was not affected by fibrogenic treatments. Surprisingly, increased protein expression was accompanied with increased cytoplasmic accumulation of Rev-erbalpha, which demonstrated distributions similar to myosin, the major cellular motor protein. Cells overexpressing a cytoplasm-localized Rev-erbalpha exhibited enhanced contractility. Ectopically expressed Rev-erbalpha responded to both adipogenic ligand and fibrogenic transforming growth factor beta treatment. Rev-erb ligand SR6452 down-regulated cytoplasmic expression of Rev-erbalpha, decreased expression of fibrogenic markers and the activated phenotype in HSCs, and ameliorated fibrosis and PH in rodent models. CONCLUSIONS: Up-regulation of Rev-erbalpha is an intrinsic fibrogenic response characterized by cytoplasmic accumulation of the protein in activated HSCs. Cytoplasmic expression of Rev-erbalpha promotes a contractile phenotype. Rev-erbalpha acts as a bifunctional regulator promoting either anti- or profibrogenic response, depending on milieu. Rev-erb ligand SR6452 functions by a previously undescribed mechanism, targeting both nuclear activity and cytoplasmic expression of Rev-erbalpha. Our studies identify Rev-erbalpha as a novel regulator of HSC transdifferentiation and offers exciting new insights on the therapeutic potential of Rev-erb ligands.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>59 (6), 2383-2396</Feld596><PubVol>59</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>2383</StrtPage><EndPage>2396</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Li T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Eheim AL" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Klein S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Uschner FE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Smith AC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Brandon-Warner E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Ghosh S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Bonkovsky HL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Trebicka J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Schrum LW" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24497272</PMID><DOI>10.1002/hep.27049</DOI><KST>A170</KST><KEYWORD>adipogenesis</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADIPOCYTE DIFFERENTIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FIBROGENESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PLASMINOGEN-ACTIVATOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>fibrosis</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INHIBITOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METABOLISM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CLOCK</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51371</publishedID><Artikel>High-density peptide arrays with combinatorial laser fusing</Artikel><Journal>Advanced Materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)</Journal><ABSTr>Combinatorial laser fusing is a new method to produce high-density peptide arrays with feature sizes as small as 10 mu m.

Here, we investigated the role of S100A1, the S100 isoform with highest abundance in cardiomyocytes, when released from damaged cardiomyocytes during myocardial infarction (MI). Patients with acute MI showed significantly increased S100A1 serum levels. Experimental MI in mice induced comparable S100A1 release. S100A1 internalization was observed in cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) adjacent to damaged cardiomyocytes. In vitro analyses revealed exclusive S100A1 endocytosis by CFs, followed by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent activation of MAP kinases and NF-kappaB. CFs exposed to S100A1 assumed an immunomodulatory and anti-fibrotic phenotype characterized i.e. by enhanced intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1) and decreased collagen levels. In mice, intracardiac S100A1 injection recapitulated these transcriptional changes. Moreover, antibody-mediated neutralization of S100A1 enlarged infarct size and worsened left ventricular functional performance post-MI. Our study demonstrates alarmin properties for S100A1 from necrotic cardiomyocytes. However, the potentially beneficial role of extracellular S100A1 in MI-related inflammation and repair warrants further investigation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>6 (6), 778-794</Feld596><PubVol>6</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>778</StrtPage><EndPage>794</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Rohde D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Schon C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Boerries M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Didrihsone I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Ritterhoff J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Kubatzky KF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Volkers M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Herzog N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Mahler M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Tsoporis JN" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Parker TG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Linke B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Giannitsis E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Gao E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Peppel K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Katus HA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Most P" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24833748</PMID><KST>D030</KST><KST>L601</KST><KEYWORD>INFARCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOBILITY GROUP BOX-1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DYSFUNCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLYCATION END-PRODUCTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEART</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RAT CARDIAC FIBROBLASTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALPHA-ALPHA PROTEIN</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51374</publishedID><Artikel>Enterolactone concentrations and prognosis after postmenopausal breast cancer: Assessment of effect modification and meta-analysis</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>We previously reported that high concentrations of enterolactone, a lignan metabolite, are associated with lower mortality in 1,140 breast cancer patients from Germany. Using an extended set of 2,182 patients aged 50-74 years at diagnosis (2001-2005) and prospectively followed up until 2009, we investigated whether the association with mortality differs by lifestyle factors and tumor characteristics. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using multivariable Cox regression. Potential differential effects by tumor characteristics and lifestyle factors were assessed and a meta-analysis of five studies addressing lignan exposure and breast cancer prognosis was performed to summarize evidence. Median enterolactone concentrations were 17.4 (+/-30.5 standard deviation) and 22.9 nmol L(-1) (+/-44.8), respectively, for 269 deceased and 1,913 patients still alive. High enterolactone concentrations were significantly associated with lower all-cause mortality (per 10 nmol L(-1) : HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.90-0.98), breast cancer-specific mortality (HR 0.94, 0.89-0.99), and distant disease-free survival (HR 0.94, 0.90-0.98).

In patients with healthy lifestyle (BMI &lt;25, nonsmoker, physically active), the inverse association with all-cause mortality was still apparent (HR 0.92, 0.85-0.99). The meta-analysis yielded significant associations both for all-cause (HR 0.57, 0.42-0.78) and breast cancer-specific mortality (HR 0.54, 0.39-0.75). Our findings show that high lignan exposure is associated with reduced mortality in breast cancer patients. The inverse association observed in this study cannot be entirely explained by a healthy lifestyle.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>135 (4), 923-933</Feld596><PubVol>135</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>923</StrtPage><EndPage>933</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Seibold P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Vrieling A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Johnson TS" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Buck K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Behrens S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Kaaks R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Linseisen J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Obi N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Heinz J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Flesch-Janys D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Chang-Claude J" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24436155</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28729</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>COHORT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONSUMPTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WOMEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SERUM ENTEROLACTONE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>lignan</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>enterolignans</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Food sources</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FLAXSEED</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>phytoestrogens</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51375</publishedID><Artikel>Chromosome 17/17q gain and unaltered profiles in high resolution array-CGH are prognostically informative in neuroblastoma</Artikel><Journal>Genes Chromosomes and Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>The prognostic relevance of chromosome 17 gain in neuroblastoma is still discussed. This investigation specifies the frequency, type, size, and transcriptional relevance in a large patient cohort. Primary tumor material of 202 patients was analyzed using high-resolution oligonucleotide array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and correlated with clinical and survival data. A subset (n = 145) was correlated for differentially expressed genes (DEG) by microarray analysis. Chromosome 17 aCGH analysis showed numerical gain in 94/202 patients (47%), partial gain in 93/202 patients (46%), and no gain in 15/202 patients (7%). The frequency of partial gain was higher in stage 4 neuroblastoma (stage 1 15%; stage 2 12%; stage 3 16%; stage 4S 7%; and stage 4 50%). Overall survival (OS) was superior in patients with numerical gain compared with patients with partial gain or no gain (5-y-OS: 0.95 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.63 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.60 +/- 0.13; P &lt; 0.001). Gene expression analysis demonstrated 95/130 DEGs between tumors with numerical or partial chromosome/no gain. Only one DEG (CCKBR) was detected comparing tumors with partial gain and those with no gain. In patients with partial gain, the distribution of breakpoints did not correlate with stage and 11q status, but with MYCN amplification and 1p status. The "best" breakpoints in cases with partial 17q gain were at 42.5 Mb for event-free and 26.6 Mb for OS. Numerical gain of chromosome 17 is associated with a better prognosis than partial and no gain. The group of tumors with partial gain was similar to the group without gain with respect to stage distribution, outcome, and gene expression profile.

We aimed to investigate the association between total, animal, and plant protein intake and the incidence of type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The prospective European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-InterAct case-cohort study consists of 12,403 incident type 2 diabetes cases and a stratified subcohort of 16,154 individuals from eight European countries, with an average follow-up time of 12.0 years. Pooled country-specific hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CI of prentice-weighted Cox regression analyses were used to estimate type 2 diabetes incidence according to protein intake. RESULTS: After adjustment for important diabetes risk factors and dietary factors, the incidence of type 2 diabetes was higher in those with high intake of total protein (per 10 g: HR 1.06 [95% CI 1.02-1.09], Ptrend &lt; 0.001) and animal protein (per 10 g: 1.05 [1.02-1.08], Ptrend = 0.001). Effect modification by sex (P &lt; 0.001) and BMI among women (P &lt; 0.001) was observed. Compared with the overall analyses, associations were stronger in women, more specifically obese women with a BMI &gt;30 kg/m(2) (per 10 g animal protein: 1.19 [1.09-1.32]), and nonsignificant in men. Plant protein intake was not associated with type 2 diabetes (per 10 g: 1.04 [0.93-1.16], Ptrend = 0.098). CONCLUSIONS: High total and animal protein intake was associated with a modest elevated risk of type 2 diabetes in a large cohort of European adults. In view of the rapidly increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes, limiting iso-energetic diets high in dietary proteins, particularly from animal sources, should be considered.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>37 (7), 1854-1862</Feld596><PubVol>37</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>1854</StrtPage><EndPage>1862</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="van Nielen M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Feskens EJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Mensink M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Sluijs I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Molina E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Amiano P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Ardanaz E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Balkau B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Beulens JW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Clavel-Chapelon F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Fagherazzi G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Franks PW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Halkjaer J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Huerta JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Katzke V" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="16" name="Key TJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Krogh V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Kuhn T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Menendez VV" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Nilsson P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Palli D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Panico S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Rolandsson O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Romieu I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Sacerdote C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Sanchez MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Schulze MB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Spijkerman AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="van der A DL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Wurtz AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Zamora-Ros R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Langenberg C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Sharp SJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Forouhi NG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Wareham NJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24722499</PMID><DOI>10.2337/dc13-2627</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>FISH INTAKE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DAIRY CONSUMPTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>nutrition</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMANS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WOMENS HEALTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INSULIN-RESISTANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>metabolic syndrome</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51377</publishedID><Artikel>Mitochondrial alterations in apoptosis</Artikel><Journal>Chemistry and Physics of Lipids</Journal><ABSTr>Besides their conventional role as energy suppliers for the cell, mitochondria in vertebrates are active regulators of apoptosis. They release apoptotic factors from the intermembrane space into the cytosol through a mechanism that involves the Bcl-2 protein family, mediating permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Associated with this event, a number of additional changes affect mitochondria during apoptosis. They include loss of important mitochondrial functions, such as the ability to maintain calcium homeostasis and to generate ATP, as well as mitochondrial fragmentation and cristae remodeling. Moreover, the lipidic component of mitochondrial membranes undergoes important alterations in composition and distribution, which have turned out to be relevant regulatory events for the proteins involved in apoptotic mitochondrial damage.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>181 (), 62-75</Feld596><PubVol>181</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>62</StrtPage><EndPage>75</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Cosentino K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Garcia-Saez AJ" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24732580</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.chemphyslip.2014.04.</DOI><KST>B160</KST><KEYWORD>OUTER-MEMBRANE PROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BCL-2 FAMILY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PERMEABILITY TRANSITION PORE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BAX-DERIVED PEPTIDE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROAPOPTOTIC BAX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL-DEATH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CYTOCHROME-C RELEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MAMMALIAN-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CERAMIDE CHANNELS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51378</publishedID><Artikel>Imaging dynamic redox processes with genetically encoded probes</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology</Journal><ABSTr>Redox signalling plays an important role in many aspects of physiology, including that of the cardiovascular system. Perturbed redox regulation has been associated with numerous pathological conditions; nevertheless, the causal relationships between redox changes and pathology often remain unclear. Redox signalling involves the production of specific redox species at specific times in specific locations. However, until recently, the study of these processes has been impeded by a lack of appropriate tools and methodologies that afford the necessary redox species specificity and spatiotemporal resolution. Recently developed genetically encoded fluorescent redox probes now allow dynamic real-time measurements, of defined redox species, with subcellular compartment resolution, in intact living cells. Here we discuss the available genetically encoded redox probes in terms of their sensitivity and specificity and highlight where uncertainties or controversies currently exist. Furthermore, we outline major goals for future probe development and describe how progress in imaging methodologies will improve our ability to employ genetically encoded redox probes in a wide range of situations.

Whether baseline gene expression can identify patients who will benefit from immunochemotherapy over chemotherapy alone has not been determined. We assessed genome-wide expression of 300 pretreatment specimens from a subset of 552 patients in REACH, a study of FC or R-FC in relapsed CLL. An independent test set was derived from 282 pretreatment specimens from CLL8, a study of FC or R-FC in treatment-naive patients. Genes specific for benefit from R-FC were determinedby assessing treatment-gene interactions in Cox proportional hazards models. REACH patients with higher pretreatment protein tyrosine kinase 2 (PTK2) messenger RNA levels derived greater benefit from R-FC, with significant improvements in progression-free survival, independent of known prognostic factors in a multivariate model. Examination of PTK2 gene expression in CLL8 patients yielded similar results. Furthermore, PTK2 inhibition blunted R-dependent cell death in vitro. This retrospective analysis from 2 independent trials revealed that increased PTK2 expression is associated with improved outcomes for CLL patients treated with R-FC vs FC. PTK2 expression may be a useful biomarker for patient selection in future trials. These trials were registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00090051 (REACH) and #NCT00281918 (CLL8).</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>124 (3), 420-425</Feld596><PubVol>124</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>420</StrtPage><EndPage>425</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Weisser,M."

Since common pan-HDAC inhibitors have adverse side effects and minor anti-cancer activity against solid tumors, enzyme-specific inhibitors were developed. HDAC6 is especially well-suited for specific inhibition due to its unique domain structure and mode of action and has been suggested to provide an exceptionally suitable target for cancer therapy. However, expression and function of HDACs have been insufficiently studied in urothelial cancers (UC), a disease urgently requiring new therapeutic approaches. The present study sought to evaluate HDAC6 as a target for treatment of urothelial cancers with enzyme-specific inhibitors. We observed moderate HDAC6 overexpression in urothelial cancer tissues and a broad range of expression in urothelial cancer cell lines. In the cell lines Tubacin was the most potent inhibitor, compared with Tubastatin and ST-80, but still active only at high micromolar concentrations. HDAC6 expression levels correlated poorly with sensitivity to enzyme inhibition. Combined treatments with heat shock, HSP90 inhibition by 17-AAG, proteasome inhibition by bortezomib, or DNA-damaging agents did not result in significant synergistic effects. Experiments with siRNA-mediated knockdown further underlined that urothelial cancer cells do not critically depend on HDAC6 expression for survival.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>16 (6), 742-757</Feld596><PubVol>16</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>742</StrtPage><EndPage>757</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Rosik L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Niegisch G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Fischer U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Jung M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schulz WA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hoffmann MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24618845</PMID><DOI>10.4161/cbt.28469</DOI><KST>L601</KST></row><row><publishedID>51444</publishedID><Artikel>Suitability of circulating miRNAs as potential prognostic markers in colorectal cancer</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers and Prevention</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (12), 2632-2637</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>2632</StrtPage><EndPage>2637</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ristau J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Staffa J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Schrotz-King P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Gigic B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Makar KW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hoffmeister M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Ulrich A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Schneider M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Ulrich CM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Habermann N" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25472670</PMID><DOI>10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-14-0556</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KST>G110</KST></row><row><publishedID>51488</publishedID><Artikel>LUX-Lung 3: redundancy, toxicity or a major step forward?

Of major importance in this process is the activating lymphocyte receptor NKG2D that in humans binds to MIC and ULBP surface molecules on tumor cells. Expression of NKG2D ligands (NKG2DL) is an early event in malignant transformation, induced by stress-associated and oncogene-driven pathways. Thus NKG2DL expression is considered as an innate barrier against tumor development. However, tumor cells can overcome this barrier by shedding of NKG2DL. Ligand shedding leads to elevated levels of soluble ligands in sera of tumor patients that in case of melanoma are of strong prognostic relevance. Here we review important aspects of NKG2DL expression and regulation in tumor cells with a focus on melanoma, and discuss their clinical relevance and potential in immunotherapy.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>93 (1-2), 49-54</Feld596><PubVol>93</PubVol><PubIss>1-2</PubIss><StrtPage>49</StrtPage><EndPage>54</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Paschen A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Baingo J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Schadendorf D" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24629838</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.ejcb.2014.01.009</DOI><KST>L401</KST></row><row><publishedID>51576</publishedID><Artikel>Comment on "A method to measure cellular adhesion utilizing a polymer micro-cantilever" [Appl.

Various subsets of thymic APCs are strategically positioned in particular thymic microenvironments and they coordinate the selection of a functional and self-tolerant T cell repertoire. In this Review, we discuss the different strategies that these APCs use to sample and process self antigens and to thereby generate partly unique, 'idiosyncratic' peptide-MHC ligandomes. We discuss how the particular composition of the peptide-MHC ligandomes that are presented by specific APC subsets not only shapes the T cell repertoire in the thymus but may also indelibly imprint the behaviour of mature T cells in the periphery.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>14 (6), 377-391</Feld596><PubVol>14</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>377</StrtPage><EndPage>391</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Klein L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Kyewski B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Allen PM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Hogquist KA" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24830344</PMID><DOI>10.1038/nri3667</DOI><KST>D090</KST><KEYWORD>PLASMACYTOID DENDRITIC CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THYMIC EPITHELIAL-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>central tolerance</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SELF-ANTIGEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CLONAL DELETION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMMUNOLOGICAL-TOLERANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>B-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MHC CLASS-II</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INSULIN GENE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51588</publishedID><Artikel>Tissue design: how Drosophila tumors remodel their neighborhood</Artikel><Journal>Seminars in Cell and Developmental Biology</Journal><ABSTr>Drosophila genetics has long been appreciated as a powerful approach for discovering the normal functions of genes that act as oncogenes and tumor suppressors in human cancer. Recent studies have also highlighted its advantages for deciphering how such genes function during tumorigenesis itself. Here we detail studies relating to how tumors, generated in developing organs and adult stem cell-based tissues, remodel the tissue landscape to their benefit. Like mammalian tumors, insect tumors can dissolve extracellular matrix, recruit blood cells, migrate and invade other tissues. While much is known about how mammalian fibroblasts, immune cells and vasculature promote late tumorigenesis, less is understood about the very earliest stages of tumor development in mammals. Because Drosophila has fewer mitotic cells and a simpler tissue architecture, it affords easy detection and analysis of early clonal tumor growth. Drosophila studies have revealed both cooperative and competitive interactions between tumor and normal cells during early tumor growth. During development, these interactions typically occur with other proliferative progenitor cells, but in adult stem cell-based tissues, the stem cell niche can fuel tumor growth.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>28 (), 86-95</Feld596><PubVol>28</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>86</StrtPage><EndPage>95</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Patel PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Edgar BA" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24685612</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.semcdb.2014.03.012</DOI><KST>A220</KST><KEYWORD>ADULT MIDGUT REGENERATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMAGINAL DISCS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH-FACTOR RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMMUNE-RESPONSE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ONCOGENIC RAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMPENSATORY PROLIFERATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HIPPO PATHWAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MULTIPLE PATHWAYS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STEM-CELL PROLIFERATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUPPRESSOR GENES</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51590</publishedID><Artikel>The effect of aristolochic acid I on expression of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase in mice and rats-A comparative study</Artikel><Journal>Mutation Research / Genetic Toxicology and Environmental Mutagenesis</Journal><ABSTr>Aristolochic acid is the cause of aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN) and Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN) and their associated urothelial malignancies. Using Western blotting, we investigated the expression of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), the most efficient cytosolic enzyme that reductively activates aristolochic acid I (AAI) in mice and rats. In addition, the effect of AAI on the expression of the NQO1 protein and its enzymatic activity in these experimental animal models was examined. We found that NQO1 protein levels in cytosolic fractions isolated from liver, kidney and lung of mice differed from those expressed in these organs of rats. In mice, the highest levels of NQO1 protein and NQO1 activity were found in the kidney, followed by lung and liver. In contrast, the NQO1 protein levels and enzyme activity were lowest in rat-kidney cytosol, whereas the highest amounts of NQO1 protein and activity were found in lung cytosols, followed by those of liver. NQO1 protein and enzyme activity were induced in liver and kidney of AAI-pretreated mice compared with those of untreated mice. NQO1 protein and enzyme activity were also induced in rat kidney by AAI. Furthermore, the increase in hepatic and renal NQO1 enzyme activity was associated with AAI bio-activation and elevated AAI-DNA adduct levels were found in ex vivo incubations of cytosolic fractions with DNA and AAI. In conclusion, our results indicate that AAI can increase its own metabolic activation by inducing NQO1, thereby enhancing its own genotoxic potential.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>768 (), 1-7</Feld596><PubVol>768</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>1</StrtPage><EndPage>7</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Barta F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Levova K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Frei E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schmeiser HH" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Arlt VM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Stiborova M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24769487</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.mrgentox.2014.01.012</DOI><KST>E030</KST><KST>C016</KST><KEYWORD>reductive activation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>urothelial cancer</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BALKAN ENDEMIC NEPHROPATHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHINESE HERBS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENVIRONMENTAL CARCINOGEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ARISTOLACTAM-DNA ADDUCTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CYTOCHROMES P450 1A1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METABOLIC-ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NAD(P)H/QUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51591</publishedID><Artikel>CREB activity in dopamine D1 receptor expressing neurons regulates cocaine-induced behavioral effects</Artikel><Journal>Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience</Journal><ABSTr>It is suggested that striatal cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) regulates sensitivity to psychostimulants. To test the cell-specificity of this hypothesis we examined the effects of a dominant-negative CREB protein variant expressed in dopamine receptor D1 (D1R) neurons on cocaine-induced behaviors. A transgenic mouse strain was generated by pronuclear injection of a BAC-derived transgene harboring the A-CREB sequence under the control of the D1R gene promoter. Compared to wild-type, drug-naive mutants showed moderate alterations in gene expression, especially a reduction in basal levels of activity-regulated transcripts such as Arc and Egr2. The behavioral responses to cocaine were elevated in mutant mice. Locomotor activity after acute treatment, psychomotor sensitization after intermittent drug injections and the conditioned locomotion after saline treatment were increased compared to wild-type littermates. Transgenic mice had significantly higher cocaine conditioned place preference, displayed normal extinction of the conditioned preference, but showed an augmented cocaine-seeking response following priming-induced reinstatement. This enhanced cocaine-seeking response was associated with increased levels of activity-regulated transcripts and prodynorphin. The primary reinforcing effects of cocaine were not altered in the mutant mice as they did not differ from wild-type in cocaine self-administration under a fixed ratio schedule at the training dose. Collectively, our data indicate that expression of a dominant-negative CREB variant exclusively in neurons expressing D1R is sufficient to recapitulate the previously reported behavioral phenotypes associated with virally expressed dominant-negative CREB.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>8 (), 212-</Feld596><PubVol>8</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>212</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Bilbao A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Rieker C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Cannella N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Parlato R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Golda S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Piechota M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Korostynski M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Engblom D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Przewlocki R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Schuetz G" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Spanagel R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Parkitna JR" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24966820</PMID><DOI>10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00212</DOI><KST>A992</KST><KEYWORD>SEEKING</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSGENIC MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RESPONSES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>transcription</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALCOHOL-DRINKING</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REWARD</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADDICTION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51592</publishedID><Artikel>Prognostic significance of Zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) expression in cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts in pancreatic head cancer</Artikel><Journal>Surgery</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by an aggressive biology and poor prognosis. Experimental evidence has suggested a role for the transcriptional repressor Zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) in epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion, and metastasis in PDAC. ZEB1 expression has been observed in cancer cells as well as stromal fibroblasts. Our study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of ZEB1 expression in PDAC tissue. METHODS: Patient baseline and follow-up data were extracted from a prospectively maintained database. After clinicopathologic re-review, serial sliced tissue slides were immunostained for ZEB1, E-cadherin, vimentin, and pan-cytokeratin. ZEB1 expression in cancer cells and adjacent stromal fibroblasts was graded separately and correlated to routine histopathologic parameters and survival after resection. RESULTS: A total of 117 cases of PDAC were included in the study. High ZEB1 expression in cancer cells and in stromal cancer-associated fibroblasts was associated with poor prognosis. There was also a trend for poor prognosis with a lymph node ratio of greater than 0.10. In line with its role as an inducer of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, ZEB1 expression in cancer cells was positively correlated with Vimentin expression and negatively with E-Cadherin expression. In multivariate analysis, stromal ZEB1 expression grade was the only independent factor of survival after resection. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that ZEB1 expression in cancer cells as well as in stromal fibroblasts are strong prognostic factors in PDAC. Stromal ZEB1 expression is identified for the first time as an independent predictor of survival after resection of PDAC. This observation suggests that therapies targeting ZEB1 and its downstream pathways could hit both cancer cells and supporting cancer-associated fibroblasts.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>156 (1), 97-108</Feld596><PubVol>156</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>97</StrtPage><EndPage>108</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Bronsert P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Kohler I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Timme S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kiefer S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Werner M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Schilling O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Vashist Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Makowiec F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Brabletz T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Hopt UT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Bausch D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Kulemann B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Keck T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Wellner UF" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24929761</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.surg.2014.02.018</DOI><KST>L601</KST><KEYWORD>DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SINGLE INSTITUTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RATIO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPITHELIAL-MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>stroma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LYMPH-NODES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METASTASIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>3 DECADES</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51594</publishedID><Artikel>Expression and prognostic significance of cancer stem cell markers CD24 and CD44 in urothelial bladder cancer xenografts and patients undergoing radical cystectomy</Artikel><Journal>Urologic Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate CD24/CD44/CD47 cancer stem cell marker expressions in bladder cancer (BCa) and provide data on their prognostic significance for clinical outcome in patients undergoing radical cystectomy (RC). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Primary BCa tissue was used for xenograft studies. A tissue microarray was prepared using specimens from a cohort of 132 patients. All patients underwent RC for urothelial BCa between 2001 and 2010. Expression of CD24, CD44, and CD47 was examined in primary samples and xenografts by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Populations of CD24(low)- and CD24(high)- expressing cells were sorted and evaluated for tumorigenicity in vivo. Tissue microarray was analyzed for CD24/CD44 staining intensity and tumor-specific vs. stromal cell staining. Associations with BCa survival, BCa stage, and lymph node status were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: CD24 and CD44/CD47 expressions mark distinct cell populations within the normal urothelium as well as in BCa. CD24(high/low) expression was not sufficient to characterize CD24 as a BCa-initiating marker in in vivo primary xenotransplants. CD24 and CD44 expressions correlated with lower cancer-specific survival in patients. However, multivariate analyses of CD24 or CD44 did not demonstrate significantly increased hazards for cancer-specific death if analyzed together with stage, grade, and nodal status of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer stem cell markers CD24/CD44/CD47 are differentially expressed in cells of urothelial BCa in patients undergoing RC and influence cancer-specific survival of patients. Further evaluation of CD24/CD44/CD47 protein expression could be of high therapeutic value in BCa. However, both CD24 and CD44 expressions cannot be regarded as independent prognostic parameters for patients undergoing RC.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>32 (5), 678-686</Feld596><PubVol>32</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>678</StrtPage><EndPage>686</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hofner T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Macher-Goeppinger S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Klein C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schillert A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Eisen C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Wagner S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Rigo-Watermeier T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Baccelli I" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Vogel V" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Trumpp A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Sprick MR" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24631171</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.urolonc.2014.01.001</DOI><KST>A010</KST><KST>V960</KST><KEYWORD>METASTASIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IDENTIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>P-SELECTIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>carcinoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIGAND</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR-INITIATING CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PANCREATIC-CANCER</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51595</publishedID><Artikel>DRO1 inactivation drives colorectal carcinogenesis in ApcMin/+ mice</Artikel><Journal>Molecular Cancer Research</Journal><ABSTr>Colorectal cancer develops from adenomatous precursor lesions by a multistep process that involves several independent mutational events in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Inactivation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor gene is an early event and prerequisite for the development of human colorectal adenoma. Previous in vitro studies identified DRO1 (CCDC80) to be a putative tumor suppressor gene that is negatively regulated in colorectal cancers and down-regulated upon neoplastic transformation of epithelial cells. To investigate the in vivo role of DRO1 in colorectal carcinogenesis, a constitutive DRO1 knockout mouse model was generated. Disruption of DRO1 did not result in spontaneous intestinal tumor formation, consistent with the notion that DRO1 might have a role in suppressing the development of colon tumors in ApcMin/+ mice, a widely used model for studying the role of APC in intestinal tumorigenesis that is hampered by the fact that mice predominantly develop adenomas in the small intestine and not in the colon. Here, deletion of DRO1 in ApcMin/+ mice results in earlier death, a dramatically increased colonic tumor burden, and frequent development of colorectal carcinoma. Furthermore, enhanced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 is observed in colon epithelium and tumors from DRO1 knockout mice. Thus, this study reveals that inactivation of DRO1 is required for colorectal carcinogenesis in the ApcMin/+ mouse and establishes a new mouse model for the study of colorectal cancer. Implications: This report characterizes a new mouse model for the study of colorectal cancer and establishes DRO1 (CCDC80) as a tumor suppressor via a mechanism involving ERK-phosphorylation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>12 (11), 1655-1662</Feld596><PubVol>12</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>1655</StrtPage><EndPage>1662</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Grill JI" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Neumann J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Herbst A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Hiltwein F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Ofner A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Marschall MK" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Wolf E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Kirchner T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Goke B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Schneider MR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Kolligs FT" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25053805</PMID><KST>L701</KST></row><row><publishedID>51598</publishedID><Artikel>Probing SH2-domains using Inhibitor Affinity Purification (IAP)</Artikel><Journal>Proteome Science</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Many human diseases are correlated with the dysregulation of signal transduction processes. One of the most important protein interaction domains in the context of signal transduction is the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain that binds phosphotyrosine residues. Hence, appropriate methods for the investigation of SH2 proteins are indispensable in diagnostics and medicinal chemistry. Therefore, an affinity resin for the enrichment of all SH2 proteins in one experiment would be desirable. However, current methods are unable to address all SH2 proteins simultaneously with a single compound or a small array of compounds. RESULTS: In order to overcome these limitations for the investigation of this particular protein family in future experiments, a dipeptide-derived probe has been designed, synthesized and evaluated. This probe successfully enriched 22 SH2 proteins from mixed cell lysates which contained 50 SH2 proteins. Further characterization of the SH2 binding properties of the probe using depletion and competition experiments indicated its ability to enrich complexes consisting of SH2 domain bearing regulatory PI3K subunits and catalytic phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) subunits that have no SH2 domain. CONCLUSION: The results make this probe a promising starting point for the development of a mixed affinity resin with complete SH2 protein coverage. Moreover, the additional findings render it a valuable tool for the evaluation of PI3K complex interrupting inhibitors.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>12 (), Art.

How the transition from juvenile to adult stages occurs is poorly understood. In this study, we monitor the Arabidopsis transport protein particle II (TRAPPII) and exocyst tethering complexes throughout cytokinesis. We show that their appearance is predominantly sequential, with brief overlap at the onset and end of cytokinesis. The TRAPPII complex is required for cell plate biogenesis, and the exocyst is required for cell plate maturation. The TRAPPII complex sorts plasma membrane proteins, including exocyst subunits, at the cell plate throughout cytokinesis. We show that the two tethering complexes physically interact and propose that their coordinated action may orchestrate not only plant but also animal cytokinesis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>29 (5), 607-620</Feld596><PubVol>29</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>607</StrtPage><EndPage>620</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Rybak K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Steiner A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Synek L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Klaeger S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kulich I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Facher E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Wanner G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Kuster B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Zarsky V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Persson S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Assaad FF" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24882377</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.devcel.2014.04.029</DOI><KST>L701</KST></row><row><publishedID>51602</publishedID><Artikel>Methodological considerations on tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS)</Artikel><Journal>Neuroimage</Journal><ABSTr>Having gained a tremendous amount of popularity since its introduction in 2006, tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) can now be considered as the standard approach for voxel-based analysis (VBA) of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. Aiming to improve the sensitivity, objectivity, and interpretability of multi-subject DTI studies, TBSS includes a skeletonization step that alleviates residual image misalignment and obviates the need for data smoothing. Although TBSS represents an elegant and user-friendly framework that tackles numerous concerns existing in conventional VBA methods, it has limitations of its own, some of which have already been detailed in recent literature. In this work, we present general methodological considerations on TBSS and report on pitfalls that have not been described previously. In particular, we have identified specific assumptions of TBSS that may not be satisfied under typical conditions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the existence of such violations can severely affect the reliability of TBSS results. With TBSS being used increasingly, it is of paramount importance to acquaint TBSS users with these concerns, such that a well-informed decision can be made as to whether and how to pursue a TBSS analysis. Finally, in addition to raising awareness by providing our new insights, we provide constructive suggestions that could improve the validity and increase the impact of TBSS drastically.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>100 (), 358-369</Feld596><PubVol>100</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>358</StrtPage><EndPage>369</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Bach M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Laun FB" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Leemans A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Tax CM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Biessels GJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Stieltjes B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Maier-Hein KH" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24945661</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.06.0</DOI><KST>E020</KST><KST>E130</KST><KST>E011</KST><KST>E132</KST><KEYWORD>REGISTRATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BRAIN IMAGES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OPTIMIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MRI</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ROBUST</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ATLAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACCURATE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALIGNMENT</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51603</publishedID><Artikel>Intravoxel Incoherent Motion (IVIM) Diffusion Imaging in Prostate Cancer - What Does It Add?</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Computer Assisted Tomography</Journal><ABSTr>Objective: To compare 2 previously presented algorithms for extracting parameters from intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) studies and investigate them in the context of tissue differentiation.

Results for D were not significantly different for both methods (P = 0.22), whereas f from method 1 was significantly higher than the f from method 2 (P &lt; 0.05). The diffusion parameters D (both methods) and apparent diffusion coefficient could discriminate between tumor and normal areas (receiver operating characteristic analysis, area under the curve, &gt;= 0.90). Additionally, in subgroup analysis, only D was able to discriminate between low-and high-grade PCa. Conclusions: For tumor detection, IVIM diffusion does not yield a clear added value, but the perfusion-free diffusion constant D may hold potential for improved image-based tumor grading</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>38 (4), 558-564</Feld596><PubVol>38</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>558</StrtPage><EndPage>564</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kuru TH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Roethke MC" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Stieltjes B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Maier-Hein KH" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schlemmer HP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hadaschik BA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Fenchel M."

The correct positioning of cylindrical implants such as surgical screws, rods and guide wires is highly important. Intraoperative 3D imaging is often used to ensure proper implant placement. However, 3D image interaction is time-consuming and requires experience. We developed an automatic method that simplifies and accelerates location assessment of cylindrical implants in 3D images.

Our approach is composed of three major steps. At first, cylindrical characteristics are detected by analyzing image gradients in small image regions. Next, these characteristics are grouped in a cluster analysis. The clusters represent cylindrical implants and are used to initialize a cylinder-to-image registration. Finally, the two end points are optimized regarding image contrast along the cylinder axis.

A total of 67 images containing 420 cylindrical implants were used for testing. Different anatomical regions (calcaneus, spine) and various image sources (two mobile devices, three reconstruction methods) were investigated. Depending on the evaluation set, the detection performance was between 91.7 and 96.1 % true- positive rate with a false-positive rate between 2.0 and 3.2 %. The end point distance errors ranged from to mm and the orientation errors from to degrees. The average computation time was less than 5 seconds.

An automatic method was developed and tested that obviates the need for 3D image interaction during intraoperative assessment of cylindrical orthopedic implants. The required time for working with the viewing software of cone-beam CT device is drastically reduced and leads to a shorter time under anesthesia for the patient.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (6), 1045-1057</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>1045</StrtPage><EndPage>1057</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Goerres J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Brehler M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Franke J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Barth K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Vetter SY" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Córdova" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Gruetzner PA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Meinzer HP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Wolf I" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Nabers D."

However, there are safety and procedure duration limitations in US-guided interventions due to poor image quality and inadequate visibility of medical instruments in the field of view. To address this issue, we propose an interventional imaging system based on a mobile electromagnetic (EM) field generator (FG) attached to a US probe.

A standard US probe was integrated with an EM FG to allow combined movement of the FG with real-time imaging to achieve (1) increased tracking accuracy for medical instruments are located near the center of the tracking volume, (2) increased robustness because the FG is distant to large metallic objects, and (3) reduced setup complexity since time-consuming placement of the FG is not required. The new integrated US-FG imaging system was evaluated by assessing tracking and calibration accuracy in a clinical setting. To demonstrate clinical applicability, the prototype US-EMFG probe was tested in needle puncture procedures.

The mobile EMFG attached to a US probe yielded sub-millimeter tracking accuracy despite the presence of metal close to the FG. Calibration errors were in the range of 1-2 mm. In an initial phantom study on US-guided needle punctures, targeting errors of about 3 mm were achieved.

A combined US-EMFG probe is feasible and effective for tracking medical instruments relative to US images with high accuracy and robustness while keeping hardware complexity low.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (5), 759-768</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>759</StrtPage><EndPage>768</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Maerz K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Franz AM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Seitel A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Winterstein A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Hafezi M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Saffari A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Bendl R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Stieltjes B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Meinzer HP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Mehrabi A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Maier-Hein L."

Medulloblastoma, a clinically challenging, malignant childhood brain tumour, is no exception. Despite much progress from recent genomics studies, with recurrent changes identified in each of the four distinct tumour subgroups (WNT-pathway-activated, SHH-pathway-activated, and the less-well-characterized Group 3 and Group 4), many cases still lack an obvious genetic driver. Here we present whole-genome bisulphite-sequencing data from thirty-four human and five murine tumours plus eight human and three murine normal controls, augmented with matched whole-genome, RNA and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data. This comprehensive data set allowed us to decipher several features underlying the interplay between the genome, epigenome and transcriptome, and its effects on medulloblastoma pathophysiology. Most notable were highly prevalent regions of hypomethylation correlating with increased gene expression, extending tens of kilobases downstream of transcription start sites. Focal regions of low methylation linked to transcription-factor-binding sites shed light on differential transcriptional networks between subgroups, whereas increased methylation due to re-normalization of repressed chromatin in DNA methylation valleys was positively correlated with gene expression. Large, partially methylated domains affecting up to one-third of the genome showed increased mutation rates and gene silencing in a subgroup-specific fashion. Epigenetic alterations also affected novel medulloblastoma candidate genes (for example, LIN28B), resulting in alternative promoter usage and/or differential messenger RNA/microRNA expression. Analysis of mouse medulloblastoma and precursor-cell methylation demonstrated a somatic origin for many alterations. Our data provide insights into the epigenetic regulation of transcription and genome organization in medulloblastoma pathogenesis, which are probably also of importance in a wider developmental and disease context.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>510 (7506), 537-541</Feld596><PubVol>510</PubVol><PubIss>7506</PubIss><StrtPage>537</StrtPage><EndPage>541</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hovestadt V" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Jones DT" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Picelli S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Wang W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kool M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Northcott PA" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Sultan M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Stachurski K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Ryzhova M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Warnatz HJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Ralser M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Brun S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Bunt J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Jaeger N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="14" name="Kleinheinz K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Erkek S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="16" name="Weber UD" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="17" name="Bartholomae CC" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="18" name="von Kalle C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="19" name="Lawerenz C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="20" name="Eils J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="21" name="Koster J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Versteeg R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Milde T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="24" name="Witt O" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="25" name="Schmidt S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="26" name="Wolf S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="27" name="Pietsch T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Rutkowski S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Scheurlen W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Taylor MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Brors B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="32" name="Felsberg J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="33" name="Reifenberger G" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="34" name="Borkhardt A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="35" name="Lehrach H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Wechsler-Reya RJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Eils R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="38" name="Yaspo ML" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Landgraf P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Korshunov A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="41" name="Zapatka M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="42" name="Radlwimmer B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="43" name="Pfister SM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="44" name="Lichter P" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24847876</PMID><DOI>10.1038/nature13268</DOI><KST>B080</KST><KST>B060</KST><KST>G100</KST><KST>G340</KST><KST>B062</KST><KST>W190</KST><KST>L401</KST><KST>L101</KST><KST>G200</KST><KEYWORD>HYPERMETHYLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EMBRYONIC STEM-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUPPRESSOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER GENOME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CPG ISLAND SHORES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>methylome</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIFFERENTIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IDENTIFICATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51632</publishedID><Artikel>Antiglioma activity of GoPI-sugar, a novel gold(I)-phosphole inhibitor: chemical synthesis, mechanistic studies, and effectiveness in vivo</Artikel><Journal>Biochimica et Biophysica Acta</Journal><ABSTr>Glioblastoma, an aggressive brain tumor, has a poor prognosis and a high risk of recurrence. An improved chemotherapeutic approach is required to complement radiation therapy. Gold(I) complexes bearing phosphole ligands are promising agents in the treatment of cancer and disturb the redox balance and proliferation of cancer cells by inhibiting disulfide reductases. Here, we report on the antitumor properties of the gold(I) complex 1-phenyl-bis(2-pyridyl)phosphole gold chloride thio-beta-d-glucose tetraacetate (GoPI-sugar), which exhibits antiproliferative effects on human (NCH82, NCH89) and rat (C6) glioma cell lines. Compared to carmustine (BCNU), an established nitrosourea compound for the treatment of glioblastomas that inhibits the proliferation of these glioma cell lines with an IC50 of 430muM, GoPI-sugar is more effective by two orders of magnitude. Moreover, GoPI-sugar inhibits malignant glioma growth in vivo in a C6 glioma rat model and significantly reduces tumor volume while being well tolerated. Both the gold(I) chloro- and thiosugar-substituted phospholes interact with DNA albeit more weakly for the latter. Furthermore, GoPI-sugar irreversibly and potently inhibits thioredoxin reductase (IC50 4.3nM) and human glutathione reductase (IC50 88.5nM). However, treatment with GoPI-sugar did not significantly alter redox parameters in the brain tissue of treated animals. This might be due to compensatory upregulation of redox-related enzymes but might also indicate that the antiproliferative effects of GoPI-sugar in vivo are rather based on DNA interaction and inhibition of topoisomerase I than on the disturbance of redox equilibrium. Since GoPI-sugar is highly effective against glioblastomas and well tolerated, it represents a most promising lead for drug development.

We assessed whether the shed ectodomain of CSPG4 (sCSPG4) might circulate and reflect potential changes in CSPG4 tissue expression (pCSPG4) due to desmoplastic and malignant aberrations occurring in pancreatic tumors. Serum sCSPG4 was measured using ELISA in test (n = 83) and validation (n = 221) cohorts comprising donors (n = 11+26) and patients with chronic pancreatitis (n = 11+20) or neoplasms: benign (serous cystadenoma SCA, n = 13+20), premalignant (intraductal dysplastic IPMNs, n = 9+55), and malignant (IPMN-associated invasive carcinomas, n = 4+14; ductal adenocarcinomas, n = 35+86). Pancreatic pCSPG4 expression was evaluated using qRT-PCR (n = 139), western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. sCSPG4 was found in circulation, but its level was significantly lower in pancreatic patients than in donors. Selective maintenance was observed in advanced IPMNs and PDACs and showed a nodal association while lacking prognostic relevance. Pancreatic pCSPG4 expression was preserved or elevated, whereby neoplastic cells lacked pCSPG4 or tended to overexpress without shedding. Extreme pancreatic overexpression, membranous exposure and tissuehigh/seralow-discordance highlighted stroma-poor benign cystic neoplasm. SCA is known to display hypoxic markers and coincide with von-Hippel-Lindau and Peutz-Jeghers syndromes, in which pVHL and LBK1 mutations affect hypoxic signaling pathways. In vitro testing confined pCSPG4 overexpression to normal mesenchymal but not epithelial cells, and a third of tested carcinoma cell lines; however, only the latter showed pCSPG4-responsiveness to chronic hypoxia. siRNA-based knockdowns failed to reduce the malignant potential of either normoxic or hypoxic cells. Thus, overexpression of the newly established conditional hypoxic indicator, CSPG4, is apparently non-pathogenic in pancreatic malignancies but might mark distinct epithelial lineage and contribute to cell polarity disorders. Surficial retention on tumor cells renders CSPG4 an attractive therapeutic target. Systemic 'drop and restoration' alterations accompanying IPMN and PDAC progression indicate that the interference of pancreatic diseases with local and remote shedding/release of sCSPG4 into circulation deserves broad diagnostic exploration.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (6), e100178-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>e100178</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Keleg S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Titov A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Heller A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Giese T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Tjaden C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Ahmad SS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Gaida MM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Bauer AS" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Werner J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Giese NA" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24932730</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0100178</DOI><KST>B070</KST><KEYWORD>PAPILLARY-MUCINOUS NEOPLASMS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NG2 PROTEOGLYCAN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>uveal melanoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VITRO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STEM-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VON-HIPPEL-LINDAU</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOUSE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51634</publishedID><Artikel>Sulforaphane and TRAIL induce a synergistic elimination of advanced prostate cancer stem-like cells</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>Advanced androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC) is an aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. Apoptosis-resistant cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been identified in AIPC and are not eliminated by current therapeutics. Novel therapeutic options, which are currently being evaluated in patient studies, include TRAIL and the broccoli-derived isothiocyanate sulforaphane. Although neither agent targets normal cells, TRAIL induces apoptosis in most cancer cells, and sulforaphane eliminates CSCs. In this study, the established AIPC cell lines DU145 and PC3, with enriched CSC features, and primary patient-derived prostate CSCs were treated with sulforaphane and recombinant soluble TRAIL. We examined the effects of these drugs on NF-kappaB activity, self-renewal and differentiation potential, and stem cell signaling via spheroid- and colony-forming assays, FACS and western blot analyses, immunohistochemistry, and an antibody protein array in vitro and after xenotransplantation. We largely found a stronger effect of sulforaphane on CSC properties compared to TRAIL, though the agents acted synergistically when applied in combination. This was associated with the inhibition of TRAIL-induced NF-kappaB binding; CXCR4, Jagged1, Notch 1, SOX 2, and Nanog expression; ALDH1 activity inhibition; and the elimination of differentiation and self-renewal potential. In vivo, tumor engraftment and tumor growth were strongly inhibited, without the induction of liver necrosis or other obvious side effects. These findings suggest that sulforaphane shifts the balance from TRAIL-induced survival signals to apoptosis and thus explains the observed synergistic effect. A nutritional strategy for high sulforaphane intake may target the cancer-specific activity of TRAIL in CSCs.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>44 (5), 1470-1480</Feld596><PubVol>44</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>1470</StrtPage><EndPage>1480</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Labsch S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Liu L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bauer N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Zhang Y" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Aleksandrowicz E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Gladkich J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Schoensiegel F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Herr I" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24626333</PMID><DOI>10.3892/ijo.2014.2335</DOI><KST>G403</KST><KEYWORD>PROGRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MODEL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIFFERENTIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ES CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SELF-RENEWAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR-INITIATING CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>pluripotency</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51635</publishedID><Artikel>IMA901 for metastatic renal cell carcinoma in the context of new approaches to immunotherapy</Artikel><Journal>Future Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>The promising option of immunotherapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma has evolved from rather unspecific approaches to a specific activation of an anti-tumor T-cell response.

Transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase specifically in the hematopoietic lineage in a Cre reporter background display recombination and marker gene expression in Purkinje neurons. Here we show that reportergene expression in neurons is caused by intercellular transfer of functional Cre recombinase messenger RNA from immune cells into neurons in the absence of cell fusion. In vitro purified secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) from blood cells contain Cre mRNA, which induces recombination in neurons when injected into the brain. Although Cre-mediated recombination events in the brain occur very rarely in healthy animals, their number increases considerably in different injury models, particularly under inflammatory conditions, and extend beyond Purkinje neurons to other neuronal populations in cortex, hippocampus, and substantia nigra. Recombined Purkinje neurons differ in their miRNA profile from their nonrecombined counterparts, indicating physiological significance. These observations reveal the existence of a previously unrecognized mechanism to communicate RNA-based signals between the hematopoietic system and various organs, including the brain, in response to inflammation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>12 (6), e1001874-</Feld596><PubVol>12</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>e1001874</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Ridder K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Keller S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Dams M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Rupp AK" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schlaudraff J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Turco DD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Starmann J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Macas J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Karpova D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Devraj K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Depboylu C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Landfried B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Arnold B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Plate KH" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="14" name="Hoglinger G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Sueltmann H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="16" name="Altevogt P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="17" name="Momma S" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24893313</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pbio.1001874</DOI><KST>D050</KST><KST>D015</KST><KST>B063</KST><KST>L501</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>PURKINJE NEURONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL-FUSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FASCIA-DENTATA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOUSE-BRAIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BONE-MARROW</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VITRO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>exosomes</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CIRCULATING MICRORNAS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51637</publishedID><Artikel>Causes of death in patients with extranodal cancer of unknown primary: searching for the primary site</Artikel><Journal>BMC Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Cancer of unknown primary (CUP) is a fatal cancer, accounting for 3-5% of all diagnosed cancers. Finding the primary site is important for therapeutic choices and we believe that the organ which is designated as the cause of death may give clues about the primary site. METHODS: A total of 20,570 patients with CUP were identified from the Swedish Family-Cancer Database. Causes of death - as reported in the death certificate - were investigated, analyzing reported metastatic sites and histological subtypes separately. Survival was compared with metastatic cancer with a known primary tumor. RESULTS: An organ-specific cancer could be identified as a cause of death in approximately 60% of all CUP patients with adenocarcinoma or undifferentiated histology. In adenocarcinoma, lung cancer was the most frequent cause of death (20%), followed by pancreatic cancer (14%), and ovarian cancer (11%). Lung cancer was the most common cause of death in patients with CUP metastases diagnosed in the nervous system (69%), respiratory system (53%), and bone (47%), whereas ovarian cancer was the most common cause of death when CUP was diagnosed in the pelvis (47%) or the peritoneum (32%). In CUP diagnosed in the liver, liver and pancreatic cancers accounted for 26% and 22% of deaths, respectively. Also in squamous cell CUP, lung cancer was the most common cause of death (45%). CONCLUSIONS: According to the causes of death, the primary site appeared frequently to be either the organ where CUP metastases were diagnosed or an organ which may be traced through the known metastatic patterns of different cancer types.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>14 (), 439-</Feld596><PubVol>14</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>439</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Riihimaki M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Hemminki A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Sundquist K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Hemminki K" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24929562</PMID><DOI>10.1186/1471-2407-14-439</DOI><KST>C050</KST><KEYWORD>PRIMARY CUP</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HISTOLOGY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ORIGIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PRIMARY TUMORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>carcinoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPIDEMIOLOGY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATTERNS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SWEDEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METASTASIS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51638</publishedID><Artikel>Microtubule-dependent transport of vimentin filament precursors is regulated by actin and by the concerted action of Rho- and p21-activated kinases</Artikel><Journal>FASEB Journal</Journal><ABSTr>Intermediate filaments (IFs) form a dense and dynamic network that is functionally associated with microtubules and actin filaments. We used the GFP-tagged vimentin mutant Y117L to study vimentin-cytoskeletal interactions and transport of vimentin filament precursors. This mutant preserves vimentin interaction with other components of the cytoskeleton, but its assembly is blocked at the unit-length filament (ULF) stage. ULFs are easy to track, and they allow a reliable and quantifiable analysis of movement. Our results show that in cultured human vimentin-negative SW13 cells, 2% of vimentin-ULFs move along microtubules bidirectionally, while the majority are stationary and tightly associated with actin filaments. Rapid motor-dependent transport of ULFs along microtubules is enhanced &gt;/=5-fold by depolymerization of actin cytoskeleton with latrunculin B. The microtubule-dependent transport of vimentin ULFs is further regulated by Rho-kinase (ROCK) and p21-activated kinase (PAK): ROCK inhibits ULF transport, while PAK stimulates it. Both kinases act on microtubule transport independently of their effects on actin cytoskeleton. Our study demonstrates the importance of the actin cytoskeleton to restrict IF transport and reveals a new role for PAK and ROCK in the regulation of IF precursor transport.-Robert, A., Herrmann, H., Davidson, M. W., and Gelfand, V. I. Microtubule-dependent transport of vimentin filament precursors is regulated by actin and by the concerted action of Rho- and p21-activated kinases.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>28 (7), 2879-2890</Feld596><PubVol>28</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>2879</StrtPage><EndPage>2890</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Robert A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Herrmann H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Davidson MW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Gelfand VI" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24652946</PMID><DOI>10.1096/fj.14-250019</DOI><KST>B065</KST><KEYWORD>REORGANIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTERMEDIATE-FILAMENTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>cytoskeleton</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL-MIGRATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DYNAMICS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHOSPHORYLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>fibroblasts</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NETWORK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CYTOPLASMIC DYNEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>KINESIN</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51692</publishedID><Artikel>Chordoma: an assessment of future treatment and management strategies</Artikel><Journal>Expert Opinion on Medical Diagnostics</Journal><ABSTr>Introduction: Chordomas are locally aggressive, rare bone tumors that develop from remnants of the notochord. Most of the experience in the past years has arisen from single centers with low patient numbers. This review gives an overview of current standards in diagnosis, therapy and recent research.

Areas covered: After a brief explanation of pathogenesis, clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chordoma, the current treatment options, including surgery, radiotherapy and systemic therapy are presented. The comprehensive literature search was performed until November 2013 by using PubMed. Only peer-reviewed published articles were used. Due to the rarity of the disease, smaller case series were also considered.

Expert opinion: The therapy for chordoma should be performed in prospective randomized trials. The development of new treatment concepts requires translational research in a network of expert centers. The transcription regulator factor, brachyury, is currently the most promising approach for understanding and targeting chordoma in the future. For faster clinical advancement, the development of more cellular and animal models is necessary.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>2 (6), 557-565</Feld596><PubVol>2</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>557</StrtPage><EndPage>565</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Uhl,M."

Currently, our understanding of factors that regulate either mRNA stability or translation is rather limited. We know that often, the regulators are proteins that bind to the 3'-untranslated region; they presumably interact with ribonucleases and translation factors. However, very few such proteins have been characterized in any detail. Here we describe a genome-wide screen to find proteins implicated in post-transcriptional regulation in Trypanosoma brucei. We made a library of random genomic fragments in a plasmid that was designed for expression of proteins fused to an RNA-binding domain, the lambda-N peptide. This was transfected into cells expressing mRNAs encoding a positive or negative selectable marker, and bearing the "boxB" lambda-N recognition element in the 3'-untranslated region. The screen identified about 300 proteins that could be implicated in post-transcriptional mRNA regulation. These included known regulators, degradative enzymes and translation factors, many canonical RNA-binding proteins, and proteins that act via multi-protein complexes. However there were also nearly 150 potential regulators with no previously annotated function, or functions unrelated to mRNA metabolism. Almost 50 novel regulators were shown to bind RNA using a targeted proteome array. The screen also provided fine structure mapping of the hit candidates' functional domains. Our findings not only confirm the key role that RNA-binding proteins play in the regulation of gene expression in trypanosomatids, but also suggest new roles for previously uncharacterized proteins.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>10 (6), e1004178-</Feld596><PubVol>10</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>e1004178</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Erben ED" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Fadda A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Lueong S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Hoheisel JD" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Clayton C" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24945722</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.ppat.1004178</DOI><KST>B070</KST><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IDENTIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MESSENGER-RNAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIFE-CYCLE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENERGY-METABOLISM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BLOOD-STREAM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CCCH PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RNA-Binding Proteins</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EMERGING ROLE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51696</publishedID><Artikel>A genome-scale in vivo RNAi analysis of epithelial development in Drosophila identifies new proliferation domains outside of the stem cell niche</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Cell Science</Journal><ABSTr>The Drosophila oogenesis system provides an excellent model to study the development of epithelial tissues. Here, we report the first genome-scale in vivo RNA interference (RNAi) screen for genes controlling epithelial development. By directly analysing cell and tissue architecture we identified 1125 genes, which we assigned to seven different functions in epithelial formation and homeostasis. We validated the significance of our screen by generating mutants for Vps60, a component of the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) machinery. This analysis provided new insights into spatiotemporal control of cell proliferation in the follicular epithelium. Previous studies have identified signals controlling divisions in the follicle stem cell niche. However, 99% of cell divisions occur outside of the niche and it is unclear how these divisions are controlled. Our data distinguish two new domains outside of the stem cell niche where there are differing controls on proliferation. One domain abuts the niche and is characterised by ESCRT, Notch and JAK/STAT-mediated control of proliferation. Adjacent to this domain, another domain is defined by loss of the impact of ESCRT on cell division. Thus, during development epithelial cells pass through a variety of microenvironments that exert different modes of proliferation control. The switch between these modes might reflect a decrease in the 'stemness' of epithelial cells over time.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>127 (Pt 12), 2736-2748</Feld596><PubVol>127</PubVol><PubIss>Pt 12</PubIss><StrtPage>2736</StrtPage><EndPage>2748</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Berns N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Woichansky I" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Friedrichsen S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kraft N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Riechmann V" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24762813</PMID><DOI>10.1242/jcs.144519</DOI><KST>B110</KST><KEYWORD>FOLLICLE CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LATE ENDOSOME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EGG CHAMBER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ESCRT-II</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NOTCH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR SUPPRESSORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANTERIOR-POSTERIOR AXIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>oogenesis</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POLARITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHWAY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51697</publishedID><Artikel>Molecular dissection of Wnt3a-Frizzled8 interaction reveals essential and modulatory determinants of Wnt signaling activity</Artikel><Journal>BMC Biology</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Wnt proteins are a family of secreted signaling molecules that regulate key developmental processes in metazoans. The molecular basis of Wnt binding to Frizzled and LRP5/6 co-receptors has long been unknown due to the lack of structural data on Wnt ligands. Only recently, the crystal structure of the Wnt8-Frizzled8-cysteine-rich-domain (CRD) complex was solved, but the significance of interaction sites that influence Wnt signaling has not been assessed. RESULTS: Here, we present an extensive structure-function analysis of mouse Wnt3a in vitro and in vivo. We provide evidence for the essential role of serine 209, glycine 210 (site 1) and tryptophan 333 (site 2) in Fz binding. Importantly, we discovered that valine 337 in the site 2 binding loop is critical for signaling without contributing to binding. Mutations in the presumptive second CRD binding site (site 3) partly abolished Wnt binding. Intriguingly, most site 3 mutations increased Wnt signaling, probably by inhibiting Wnt-CRD oligomerization. In accordance, increasing amounts of soluble Frizzled8-CRD protein modulated Wnt3a signaling in a biphasic manner. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a concentration-dependent switch in Wnt-CRD complex formation from an inactive aggregation state to an activated high mobility state as a possible modulatory mechanism in Wnt signaling gradients.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>12 (), Art.

PDA-cancer stem cells (CSCs) are not targeted by current therapies and may be a reason for poor prognosis. Studies indicate that diets rich in cabbage, broccoli, and cauliflower offer cancer preventative and therapeutic benefits. Recent experimental studies have confirmed these findings and demonstrated that isothiocyanate, sulforaphane, and the polyphenol, quercetin, effectively reduced tumor growth and enhanced the sensitivity of the cancer cells to current chemotherapeutics. The aim of the present study is to test the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial on the application of freeze-dried broccoli sprouts in patients with advanced PDA. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: The study is designed as a prospective randomized, double-blinded pilot trial with a treatment and a placebo-controlled arm in a single center setting. A total number of forty patients (18 years or older) in two parallel groups with advanced, surgically non-resectable PDA under palliative chemotherapy are planned for recruitment. Patients in the treatment group will receive fifteen capsules of the study substance per day (90 mg of active sulforaphane) during the chemotherapy treatment course. Patients in the placebo group will receive the same capsule size and portion distribution with inactive substances (mainly methylcellulose). The follow-up duration is one year. Feasibility of the study substance, adverse effects, and patient compliance, as well as levels of serum tumor markers (CEA, CA 19-9), quality of life, and patient overall survival rates will be assessed at defined points of time. DISCUSSION: The POUDER trial is expected to transfer promising experimental and epidemiological data into a clinical pilot study to assess the effectiveness of broccoli sprout extracts in the treatment of advanced PDA. The study objectives will provide data on the clinical feasibility and acceptability of a supportive treatment option accompanying palliative chemotherapy. Based on these results, future clinical studies to create further evidence in this field are possible. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The POUDER trial has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov with an ID NCT01879878 and WHO with an ID U1111-1144-2013 on June 13th 2013.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>15 (), Art.

Malignant transformation occurs in less than 1% of the cases. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of human papillomavirus (HPV) type 11-associated juvenile-onset RRP (JORRP) initially diagnosed at the age of two years. Remarkably high copy numbers of HPV11 DNA and antibody titres targeting the capsid protein L1 were detected in the patient's serum. The patient developed squamous cell carcinomas in both lungs and extraordinarily an HPV11 DNA-positive papillary endocardial lesion in the left atrium of the heart, which caused thromboembolic events leading to the patient's death at 19 years old. CONCLUSION: We here report a severe case of JORRP hallmarked by HPV11 DNAemia and very high antibody titres directed against the major viral capsid protein L1. Furthermore, the extent of malignant transformation and the discovery of a very rare fatal endocardial lesion highlight the unpredictability of JORRP and the complexity of its clinical management.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>11 (), Art.

Still, however, the mechanisms leading to the expression of the NKG2D ligands are far from being completely understood. Here, we use an unbiased and systematic RNA pull-down approach combined with mass spectrometry to identify six RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that bind and regulate the expression of MICB, one of the major stress-induced ligands of NKG2D. We further demonstrate that at least two of the identified RBPs function during genotoxic stress.

We previously addressed this issue by initiating the first systematic archive of medical literature containing sex and/or gender-specific analyses. This initial collection has now been greatly enlarged and re-organized as a free user-friendly database with multiple functions: GenderMedDB (http://gendermeddb.charite.de). DESCRIPTION: GenderMedDB retrieves the included publications from the PubMed database. Manuscripts containing sex and/or gender-specific analysis are continuously screened and the relevant findings organized systematically into disciplines and diseases. Publications are furthermore classified by research type, subject and participant numbers. More than 11,000 abstracts are currently included in the database, after screening more than 40,000 publications. The main functions of the database include searches by publication data or content analysis based on pre-defined classifications. In addition, registrants are enabled to upload relevant publications, access descriptive publication statistics and interact in an open user forum.

Patients from the HIT2000 cooperative clinical trial were prospectively enrolled based on the availability of sufficient tumor material and complete clinical information. This revealed a cohort of 184 patients (median age 7.6 years), which was randomly split at a 2:1 ratio into a training (n = 127), and a test (n = 57) dataset in order to build and test a risk score for this population. Independent validation was performed in a non-overlapping cohort (n = 83). All samples were subjected to thorough histopathological investigation, CTNNB1 mutation analysis, quantitative PCR, MLPA and FISH analyses for cytogenetic variables, and methylome analysis. By univariable analysis, clinical factors (M-stage), histopathological variables (large cell component, endothelial proliferation, synaptophysin pattern), and molecular features (chromosome 6q status, MYC amplification, subgrouping) were found to be prognostic. Molecular consensus subgrouping (WNT, SHH, Group 3, Group 4) was validated as an independent feature to stratify patients into different risk groups. When comparing methods for the identification of WNT-driven medulloblastoma, this study identified CTNNB1 sequencing and methylation profiling to most reliably identify these patients. After removing patients with particularly favorable (CTNNB1 mutation, extensive nodularity) or unfavorable (MYC amplification) markers, a risk score for the remaining "intermediate molecular risk" population dependent on age, M-stage, pattern of synaptophysin expression, and MYCN copy-number status was identified, with speckled synaptophysin expression indicating worse outcome. Test and independent validation of the score confirmed significant discrimination of patients by risk profile. Methylation subgrouping and CTNNB1 mutation status represent robust tools for the risk stratification of medulloblastoma. A simple clinico-pathological risk score was identified, which was confirmed in a test set and by independent clinical validation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>128 (1), 137-149</Feld596><PubVol>128</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>137</StrtPage><EndPage>149</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Pietsch T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Schmidt R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Remke M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Korshunov A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Hovestadt V" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Jones DT" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Felsberg J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Kaulich K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Goschzik T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Kool M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Northcott PA" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="von Hoff K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="von Bueren AO" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Friedrich C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Mynarek M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Skladny H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Fleischhack G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Taylor MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Cremer F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Lichter P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="20" name="Faldum A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Reifenberger G" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="22" name="Rutkowski S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Pfister SM" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24791927</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00401-014-1276-0</DOI><KST>B060</KST><KST>G380</KST><KST>B062</KST><KST>L401</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>TP53 mutation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUBGROUPS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHILDHOOD MEDULLOBLASTOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>outcome prediction</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AMPLIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VARIANTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>chemotherapy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISTINCT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CRANIOSPINAL RADIOTHERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WNT/WINGLESS PATHWAY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51719</publishedID><Artikel>Genomic and transcriptomic analyses match medulloblastoma mouse models to their human counterparts</Artikel><Journal>Acta Neuropathologica</Journal><ABSTr>Medulloblastoma is a malignant embryonal brain tumor with highly variable outcome. In order to study the biology of this tumor and to perform preclinical treatment studies, a lot of effort has been put into the generation of appropriate mouse models. The usage of these models, however, has become debatable with the advances in human medulloblastoma subgrouping. This study brings together multiple relevant mouse models and matches genetic alterations and gene expression data of 140 murine tumors with 423 human medulloblastomas in a global way. Using AGDEX analysis and k-means clustering, we show that the Blbp-cre::Ctnnb1(ex3)(Fl/+)Trp53 (Fl/Fl) mouse model fits well to human WNT medulloblastoma, and that, among various Myc- or Mycn-based mouse medulloblastomas, tumors in Glt1-tTA::TRE-MYCN/Luc mice proved to be most specific for human group 3 medulloblastoma. None of the analyzed models displayed a significant match to group 4 tumors. Intriguingly, mice with Ptch1 or Smo mutations selectively modeled SHH medulloblastomas of adulthood, although such mutations occur in all human age groups. We therefore suggest that the infantile or adult gene expression pattern of SHH MBs are not solely determined by specific mutations. This is supported by the observation that human medulloblastomas with PTCH1 mutations displayed more similarities to PTCH1 wild-type tumors of the same age group than to PTCH1-mutated tumors of the other age group. Together, we provide novel insights into previously unrecognized specificity of distinct models and suggest these findings as a solid basis to choose the appropriate model for preclinical studies on medulloblastoma.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>128 (1), 123-136</Feld596><PubVol>128</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>123</StrtPage><EndPage>136</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Poschl J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Stark S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Neumann P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Groebner S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kawauchi D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Jones DT" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Northcott PA" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Lichter P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Pfister SM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Kool M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Schueller U" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24871706</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00401-014-1297-8</DOI><KST>B060</KST><KST>B062</KST><KEYWORD>CROSS-SPECIES GENOMICS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOLECULAR SUBGROUPS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISTINCT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIFFERENTIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DE-NOVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METHYLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENETIC PROFILES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HOXA CLUSTER</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51721</publishedID><Artikel>Photon and carbon ion irradiation of a rat prostate carcinoma: Does a higher fraction number increase the metastatic rate?</Artikel><Journal>Radiation Research</Journal><ABSTr>In a recent published study, we investigated the response of an experimental prostate carcinoma (R3327-AT1) after irradiation with 1, 2 or 6 fractions of carbon ions or photons, respectively.

However, we now report an increased metastatic rate when the number of fractions was increased from 2 to 6. In a total of 246 animals, the actuarial metastatic rates for 1, 2 and 6 fractions were 5.1 +/- 3.5%, 5.7 +/- 4.0% and 15.3 +/- 7.1% for photons and 9.8 +/- 7.5%, 4.0 +/- 3.9% and 20.3 +/- 6.5% for carbon ions, respectively. The increase was significant only for carbon ions (6 vs. 2 fractions, P = 0.03). Although the original experiment was not designed to investigate metastatic rates, this observation may be of general interest to researchers studying radiation-modulated metastatic activity.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>181 (6), 623-628</Feld596><PubVol>181</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>623</StrtPage><EndPage>628</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Karger,C.P."

The steep dose gradient of the Bragg curve allows the irradiation of targets with high-dose and a narrow dose penumbra around the target, in contrast to photon irradiation. This, however, makes heavy ion-beam therapy very sensitive to minor changes in the range calculation of the treatment planning system, as it has a direct influence on the outcome of the treatment. Our previous study has shown that ion radiography with an amorphous silicon flat-panel detector allows the measurement of the water equivalent thickness (WET) of an imaging object with good accuracy and high spatial resolution. In this study, the developed imaging technique is used to measure the WET distribution of a patient-like phantom, and these results are compared to the WET calculation of the treatment planning system. To do so, a measured two-dimensional map of the WET of an anthropomorphic phantom was compared to WET distributions based on x-ray computed tomography images as used in the treatment planning system. It was found that the WET maps agree well in the overall shape and two-dimensional distribution of WET values. Quantitatively, the ratio of the two-dimensional WET maps shows a mean of 1.004 with a standard deviation of 0.022. Differences were found to be concentrated at high WET gradients. This could be explained by the Bragg-peak degradation, which is measured in detail by ion radiography with the flat-panel detector, but is not taken into account in the treatment planning system. Excluding pixels exhibiting significant Bragg-peak degradation, the mean value of the ratio was found to be 1.000 with a standard deviation of 0.012. Employment of the amorphous silicon flat-panel detector for WET measurements allows us to detect uncertainties of the WET determination in the treatment planning process. This makes the investigated technique a very helpful tool to study the WET determination of critical and complex phantom cases</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>59 (14), 3737-3747</Feld596><PubVol>59</PubVol><PubIss>14</PubIss><StrtPage>3737</StrtPage><EndPage>3747</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Telsemeyer,J."

Infection affects homeostasis within the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche, as lost immune cells must be replaced by HSCs. During the immune response, interferon is produced. Surprisingly, HSCs respond directly to interferon, entering the cell cycle from even the most dormant state. The complex response of both the HSCs and the niche to infection is a unique platform on which to consider HSC-niche interactions. Here, we comment on the contribution of the immune system to the niche and on the direct and indirect effect that infection has on HSCs in the niche.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>1310 (), 51-57</Feld596><PubVol>1310</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>51</StrtPage><EndPage>57</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Prendergast AM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Essers MA" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24611873</PMID><DOI>10.1111/nyas.12400</DOI><KST>A010</KST><KST>V960</KST><KST>A011</KST><KEYWORD>E-SELECTIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>mesenchymal stromal cells</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOBILIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SELF-RENEWAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IFN-GAMMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DOWN-REGULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BONE-MARROW</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTERFERON</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGENITOR CELLS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51735</publishedID><Artikel>Investigating the role of F-actin in human immunodeficiency virus assembly by live-cell microscopy</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Virology</Journal><ABSTr>Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) particles assemble at the plasma membrane, which is lined by a dense network of filamentous actin (F-actin). Large amounts of actin have been detected in HIV-1 virions, proposed to be incorporated by interactions with the nucleocapsid domain of the viral polyprotein Gag. Previous studies addressing the role of F-actin in HIV-1 particle formation using F-actin-interfering drugs did not yield consistent results. Filamentous structures pointing toward nascent HIV-1 budding sites, detected by cryo-electron tomography and atomic force microscopy, prompted us to revisit the role of F-actin in HIV-1 assembly by live-cell microscopy. HeLa cells coexpressing HIV-1 carrying fluorescently labeled Gag and a labeled F-actin-binding peptide were imaged by live-cell total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIR-FM). Computational analysis of image series did not reveal characteristic patterns of F-actin in the vicinity of viral budding sites. Furthermore, no transient recruitment of F-actin during bud formation was detected by monitoring fluorescence intensity changes at nascent HIV-1 assembly sites. The chosen approach allowed us to measure the effect of F-actin-interfering drugs on the assembly of individual virions in parallel with monitoring changes in the F-actin network of the respective cell. Treatment of cells with latrunculin did not affect the efficiency and dynamics of Gag assembly under conditions resulting in the disruption of F-actin filaments. Normal assembly rates were also observed upon transient stabilization of F-actin by short-term treatment with jasplakinolide. Taken together, these findings indicate that actin filament dynamics are dispensable for HIV-1 Gag assembly at the plasma membrane of HeLa cells. Importance: HIV-1 particles assemble at the plasma membrane of virus-producing cells. This membrane is lined by a dense network of actin filaments that might either present a physical obstacle to the formation of virus particles or generate force promoting the assembly process. Drug-mediated interference with the actin cytoskeleton showed different results for the formation of retroviral particles in different studies, likely due to general effects on the cell upon prolonged drug treatment. Here, we characterized the effect of actin-interfering compounds on the HIV-1 assembly process by direct observation of virus formation in live cells, which allowed us to measure assembly rate constants directly upon drug addition. Virus assembly proceeded with normal rates when actin filaments were either disrupted or stabilized. Taken together with the absence of characteristic actin filament patterns at viral budding sites in our analyses, this indicates that the actin network is dispensable for HIV-1 assembly.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>88 (14), 7904-7914</Feld596><PubVol>88</PubVol><PubIss>14</PubIss><StrtPage>7904</StrtPage><EndPage>7914</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Rahman SA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Koch P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Weichsel J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Godinez WJ" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schwarz U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Rohr K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Lamb DC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Krausslich HG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Mueller B" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24789789</PMID><DOI>10.1128/JVI.00431-14</DOI><KST>B080</KST><KEYWORD>ORGANIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TYPE-1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FILAMENTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SPREAD</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POLYMERIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HOST-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NATURAL-PRODUCT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CYTOSKELETON DYNAMICS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HIV-1 PARTICLES</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51736</publishedID><Artikel>Combined targeting of TGF-beta1 and integrin beta3 impairs lymph node metastasis in a mouse model of non-small-cell lung cancer</Artikel><Journal>Molecular Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-beta) acts as a tumor suppressor early in carcinogenesis but turns into tumor promoter in later disease stages. In fact, TGF-beta is a known inducer of integrin expression by tumor cells which contributes to cancer metastatic spread and TGF-beta inhibition has been shown to attenuate metastasis in mouse models. However, carcinoma cells often become refractory to TGF-beta-mediated growth inhibition. Therefore identifying patients that may benefit from anti-TGF-beta therapy requires careful selection. METHODS: We performed in vitro analysis of the effects of exposure to TGF-beta in NSCLC cell chemotaxis and adhesion to lymphatic endothelial cells. We also studied in an orthotopic model of NSCLC the incidence of metastases to the lymph nodes after inhibition of TGF-beta signaling, beta3 integrin expression or both. RESULTS: We offer evidences of increased beta3-integrin dependent NSCLC adhesion to lymphatic endothelium after TGF-beta exposure. In vivo experiments show that targeting of TGF-beta and beta3 integrin significantly reduces the incidence of lymph node metastasis. Even more, blockade of beta3 integrin expression in tumors that did not respond to TGF-beta inhibition severely impaired the ability of the tumor to metastasize towards the lymph nodes. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that lung cancer tumors refractory to TGF-beta monotherapy can be effectively treated using dual therapy that combines the inhibition of tumor cell adhesion to lymphatic vessels with stromal TGF-beta inhibition.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>13 (), Art.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: FaDu human squamous cell carcinomas (hSCCs) growing subcutaneously in nude mice were subjected to [(18)F]FMISO PET before irradiation with single doses of 25 or 35Gy under normal blood flow conditions. [(18)F]FMISO hypoxic volume (HV) and maximum standardised uptake value (SUVmax) were used to quantify tracer uptake. The animals were followed up for at least 120days after irradiation. The endpoints were permanent local tumour control and time to local recurrence. RESULTS: HV varied between 38 and 291mm(3) (median 105mm(3)). Non-hypoxic tumours (HV below median) showed significantly better local control after single dose irradiation than hypoxic tumours (HV above median) (p=0.046). The effect of dose was significant and not different in non-hypoxic and in hypoxic tumours (HR=0.82 [95% CI 0.71; 0.93], p=0.002 and HR=0.86 [0.78; 0.95], p=0.001, respectively). Dose escalation resulted in an incremental increase of local tumour control from low-dose hypoxic, over low-dose non-hypoxic and high-dose hypoxic to high-dose non-hypoxic tumours. SUVmax did not reveal significant association with local control at any dose level. CONCLUSIONS: The negative effect of [(18)F]FMISO HV on permanent local tumour control supports the prognostic value of the pre-treatment [(18)F]FMISO HV. Making the assumption that variable [(18)F]FMISO uptake in different FaDu tumours which all have the same genetic background may serve as an experimental model of intratumoural heterogeneity, the data support the concept of dose-escalation with inhomogeneous dose distribution based on pre-treatment [(18)F]FMISO uptake.

Using Cox proportional hazards models, we estimated the associations of adiposity, smoking, physical activity, alcohol consumption, and diet with risk of developing stroke. A competing risk model built from cause-specific proportional hazards models accounting for concurrent risk of death was used to calculate relative and absolute reductions in stroke occurrences that could have been achieved by maintaining a healthy lifestyle pattern. RESULTS: Obesity, smoking, alcohol consumption, diet, and physical inactivity were each identified as modifiable lifestyle risk factors for stroke. About 38% of stroke cases were estimated as preventable through adherence to a healthy lifestyle profile (never smoking, maintaining optimal body mass index and waist circumference, performing physical exercise, consuming a moderate quantity of alcohol, and following a healthy dietary pattern). Age-specific estimates of 5-year incidence rates for stroke in the actual cohort and in a hypothetical, comparable cohort of individuals following a healthy lifestyle would be reduced from 153 to 94 per 100 000 women and from 261 to 161 per 100 000 men for the age group 60 to 65 years. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis confirms the strong primary prevention potential for stroke based on avoidance of excess body weight, smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, unhealthy diet, and physical inactivity.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>45 (7), 2041-2046</Feld596><PubVol>45</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>2041</StrtPage><EndPage>2046</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Tikk K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Sookthai D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Monni S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Gross ML" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Lichy C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Kloss M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Kaaks R" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24876086</PMID><DOI>10.1161/STROKEAHA.114.005025</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>30-DAY CASE-FATALITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ISCHEMIC-STROKE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRENDS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WOMEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RATES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Germany</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POPULATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51739</publishedID><Artikel>STAT3 expression, activity and functional consequences of STAT3 inhibition in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas and Barrett's adenocarcinomas</Artikel><Journal>Oncogene</Journal><ABSTr>Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is altered in several epithelial cancers and represents a potential therapeutic target. Here, STAT3 expression, activity and cellular functions were examined in two main histotypes of esophageal carcinomas. In situ, immunohistochemistry for STAT3 and STAT3-Tyr705 phosphorylation (P-STAT3) in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC, n=49) and Barrett's adenocarcinomas (BAC, n=61) revealed similar STAT3 expression in ESCCs and BACs (P=0.109), but preferentially activated P-STAT3 in ESCCs (P=0.013). In vitro, strong STAT3 activation was seen by epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation in OE21 (ESCC) cells, whereas OE33 (BAC) cells showed constitutive weak STAT3 activation. STAT3 knockdown significantly reduced cell proliferation of OE21 (P=0.0148) and OE33 (P=0.0243) cells. Importantly, STAT3 knockdown reduced cell migration of OE33 cells by 2.5-fold in two types of migration assays (P=0.073, P=0.015), but not in OE21 cells (P=0.1079, P=0.386). Investigation of transcriptome analysis of STAT3 knockdown revealed a reduced STAT3 level associated with significant downregulation of cell cycle genes in both OE21 (P&lt;0.0001) and OE33 (P=0.01) cells. In contrast, genes promoting cell migration (CTHRC1) were markedly upregulated in OE21 cells, whereas a gene linked to tight-junction stabilization and restricted cell motility (SHROOM2) was downregulated in OE21 but upregulated in OE33 cells. This study shows frequent, but distinct, patterns of STAT3 expression and activation in ESCCs and BACs. STAT3 knockdown reduces cell proliferation in ESCC and BAC cells, inhibits migration of BAC cells and may support cell migration of ESCC cells. Thereby, novel STAT3-regulated genes involved in ESCC and BAC cell proliferation and cell migration were identified. Thus, STAT3 may be further exploited as a potential novel therapeutic target, however, by careful distinction between the two histotypes of esophageal cancers.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>33 (25), 3256-3266</Feld596><PubVol>33</PubVol><PubIss>25</PubIss><StrtPage>3256</StrtPage><EndPage>3266</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Timme S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Ihde S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Fichter CD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Waehle V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Bogatyreva L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Atanasov K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Kohler I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Schopflin A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Geddert H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Faller G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Klimstra D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Tang L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Reinheckel T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Hauschke D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Busch H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Boerries M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="16" name="Werner M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="17" name="Lassmann S" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>23912451</PMID><KST>L601</KST><KEYWORD>PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH-FACTOR RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHWAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>gene amplification</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSCRIPTION 3</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TYROSINE-PHOSPHORYLATED STAT3</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATED SIGNAL TRANSDUCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MULTIPOLAR MITOSES</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51740</publishedID><Artikel>Boolean ErbB network reconstructions and perturbation simulations reveal individual drug response in different breast cancer cell lines</Artikel><Journal>BMC Systems Biology</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Despite promising progress in targeted breast cancer therapy, drug resistance remains challenging. The monoclonal antibody drugs trastuzumab and pertuzumab as well as the small molecule inhibitor erlotinib were designed to prevent ErbB-2 and ErbB-1 receptor induced deregulated protein signalling, contributing to tumour progression. The oncogenic potential of ErbB receptors unfolds in case of overexpression or mutations. Dimerisation with other receptors allows to bypass pathway blockades. Our intention is to reconstruct the ErbB network to reveal resistance mechanisms. We used longitudinal proteomic data of ErbB receptors and downstream targets in the ErbB-2 amplified breast cancer cell lines BT474, SKBR3 and HCC1954 treated with erlotinib, trastuzumab or pertuzumab, alone or combined, up to 60 minutes and 30 hours, respectively. In a Boolean modelling approach, signalling networks were reconstructed based on these data in a cell line and time course specific manner, including prior literature knowledge. Finally, we simulated network response to inhibitor combinations to detect signalling nodes reflecting growth inhibition. RESULTS: The networks pointed to cell line specific activation patterns of the MAPK and PI3K pathway. In BT474, the PI3K signal route was favoured, while in SKBR3, novel edges highlighted MAPK signalling. In HCC1954, the inferred edges stimulated both pathways. For example, we uncovered feedback loops amplifying PI3K signalling, in line with the known trastuzumab resistance of this cell line. In the perturbation simulations on the short-term networks, we analysed ERK1/2, AKT and p70S6K. The results indicated a pathway specific drug response, driven by the type of growth factor stimulus. HCC1954 revealed an edgetic type of PIK3CA-mutation, contributing to trastuzumab inefficacy. Drug impact on the AKT and ERK1/2 signalling axes is mirrored by effects on RB and RPS6, relating to phenotypic events like cell growth or proliferation. Therefore, we additionally analysed RB and RPS6 in the long-term networks. CONCLUSIONS: We derived protein interaction models for three breast cancer cell lines. Changes compared to the common reference network hint towards individual characteristics and potential drug resistance mechanisms. Simulation of perturbations were consistent with the experimental data, confirming our combined reverse and forward engineering approach as valuable for drug discovery and personalised medicine.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>8 (), Art.

The expression pattern of these microRNAs both depends on the lineage of the infected cells and on the type of viral latency. Whilst BART microRNAs are expressed in all EBV-infected tumors, the BHRF1 locus is nearly exclusively expressed in cells that display a type III latency. However, the BART microRNA expression level is several orders of magnitude higher in epithelial cells than in B cells. Genetic studies have demonstrated that the BHRF1 microRNA cluster enhances the initial phases of primary B cell transformation through inhibition of apoptosis. A similar role has been ascribed to the BART microRNAs although their contribution to this process seems more limited. These microRNAs also enhance the survival of B cell lymphoma cells. Using various strategies including high throughput assays, several groups have identified mRNAs targeted by the EBV microRNAs. Here we compare the results of the published high throughput screens and review the viral and cellular genes thought to represent high confidence targets for the EBV microRNAs. Although genetic studies allow unequivocal evaluation of the functions served by the microRNAs, only a few key targets have been identified so far.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>26 (), 52-59</Feld596><PubVol>26</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>52</StrtPage><EndPage>59</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Klinke O" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Feederle R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Delecluse HJ" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24602823</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.semcancer.2014.02.00</DOI><KST>F100</KST><KEYWORD>ENCODED MICRORNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NASOPHARYNGEAL CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>protein expression</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MESSENGER-RNAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL LYMPHOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSLATIONAL REPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TARGET RECOGNITION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENERATE VIRAL MICRORNAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN GAMMA-HERPESVIRUSES</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51743</publishedID><Artikel>Methods for analyzing and quantifying protein-protein interaction</Artikel><Journal>Expert Review of Proteomics</Journal><ABSTr>Genome sequencing has led to the identification of many proteins, which had not been recognized before. In consequence, the basic set of human proteins is generally known. Far less information, however, exists about protein-protein interactions, which are required and responsible for cellular activities and their control. Many protein isoforms that result from mutations, splice-variations and post-translational modifications also come into play. Until recently, interactions of only few protein partners could be analyzed in a single experiment. However, this does not meet the challenge of investigating the highly complex interaction patterns in cellular systems. It is made even more demanding by the need to determine the intensity of interactions quantitatively in order to properly understand protein interplay. Currently available techniques vary with respect to accuracy, reliability, reproducibility and throughput and their performances range from a mere qualitative demonstration of binding to a quantitative characterization of affinities. In this article, an overview is given of the methodologies available for analysis of protein-protein interactions.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>11 (1), 107-120</Feld596><PubVol>11</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>107</StrtPage><EndPage>120</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Syafrizayanti" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Betzen C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Hoheisel JD" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kastelic D" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24393018</PMID><DOI>10.1586/14789450.2014.875857</DOI><KST>B070</KST><KEYWORD>INTERACTION NETWORK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FLUORESCENCE POLARIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CODED AFFINITY TAGS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>QUANTITATIVE PROTEOMICS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURFACE-PLASMON RESONANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LABEL-FREE DETECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MASS-SPECTROMETRY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ISOTHERMAL TITRATION CALORIMETRY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MICROSCALE THERMOPHORESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BACKSCATTERING INTERFEROMETRY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51811</publishedID><Artikel>The CARD11-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) signalosome complex: Stepping into the limelight of human primary immunodeficiency</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology</Journal><ABSTr>Next-generation DNA sequencing has accelerated the genetic characterization of many human primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs). These discoveries can be lifesaving for the affected patients and also provide a unique opportunity to study the effect of specific genes on human immune function. In the past 18 months, a number of independent groups have begun to define novel PIDs caused by defects in the caspase recruitment domain family, member 11 (CARD11)-B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 10 (BCL10)-mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation gene 1 (MALT1 [CBM]) signalosome complex. The CBM complex forms an essential molecular link between the triggering of cell-surface antigen receptors and nuclear factor kappaB activation. Germline mutations affecting the CBM complex are now recognized as the cause of novel combined immunodeficiency phenotypes, which all share abnormal nuclear factor kappaB activation and dysregulated B-cell development as defining features. For this "Current perspectives" article, we have engaged experts in both basic biology and clinical immunology to capture the worldwide experience in recognizing and managing patients with PIDs caused by CBM complex mutations.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>134 (2), 276-284</Feld596><PubVol>134</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>276</StrtPage><EndPage>284</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Turvey SE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Durandy A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Fischer A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Fung SY" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Geha RS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Gewies A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Giese T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Greil J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Keller B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="McKinnon ML" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Neven B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Rozmus J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Ruland J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Snow AL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Stepensky P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Warnatz K" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25087226</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.jaci.2014.06.015</DOI><KST>L701</KST></row><row><publishedID>51825</publishedID><Artikel>Patients with cancer of unknown primary: a retrospective analysis of 223 patients with adenocarcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma</Artikel><Journal>Deutsches Aerzteblatt International</Journal><ABSTr>Background: Cancer of unknown primary (CUP) now accounts for 2-3% of all fatal cases of cancer in Germany. Histologically, most of these tumors are either adenocarcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma. Scant data on their clinical features and prognosis are now available, and the published survival times are highly variable. In this article, we document and analyze our own experience with CUP to date.

Methods: We took all 223 patients with CUP (adenocarcinoma or undifferentiated carcinoma) whom we saw in our CUP clinic from 2006 to 2010 as an unaltered sample for retrospective analysis of clinical data and overall survival. We performed the analysis with Kaplan-Meier plotting, log-rank testing, and Cox regression.

Results: With a median follow-up time of 32.9 months, the median survival from the time of diagnosis was 16.5 months. Metastases were most commonly found in the lymph nodes, followed by the liver, bones, and lungs. The main pre-treatment prognostic variables that remained significant after adjustment for multiple testing were the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score for overall state of health and the number of organ systems involved. These variables were used to construct a practice-oriented risk stratification.

Conclusion: In patients with adeno-or undifferentiated CUP syndrome, the ECOG score and the number of organ systems involved are important risk factors.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>111 (27-28), 481-487</Feld596><PubVol>111</PubVol><PubIss>27-28</PubIss><StrtPage>481</StrtPage><EndPage>487</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Loeffler,H."

A single nucleotide polymorphism in the MDM2 promotor region, MDM2SNP309, was shown to soothe the p53 pathway. In the current study, we aimed to clarify the effect of the MDM2SNP309 on chronic lymphocytic leukemia characteristics and outcome. We performed a meta-analysis of data from 2598 individual patients from 10 different cohorts. Patients' data and genetic analysis for MDM2SNP309 genotype, immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region mutation status and fluorescence in situ hybridization results were collected. There were no differences in overall survival based on the polymorphism (log rank test, stratified by study cohort; P=0.76; GG genotype: cohort-adjusted median overall survival of 151 months; TG: 153 months; TT: 149 months). In a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, advanced age, male sex and unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region genes were associated with inferior survival, but not the MDM2 genotype. The MDM2SNP309 is unlikely to influence disease characteristics and prognosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Studies investigating the impact of individual single nucleotide polymorphisms on prognosis are often controversial. This may be due to selection bias and small sample size. A meta-analysis based on individual patient data provides a reasonable strategy for prognostic factor analyses in the case of small individual studies. Individual patient data-based meta-analysis can, therefore, be a powerful tool to assess genetic risk factors in the absence of large studies.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>99 (8), 1285-1291</Feld596><PubVol>99</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>1285</StrtPage><EndPage>1291</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Benner,A."

Penalized regression models provide a statistically appealing way of building risk prediction models from high-dimensional data. The popular CRAN package glmnet implements an efficient algorithm for fitting penalized Cox and generalized linear models. However, in practical applications the data analysis will typically not stop at the point where the model has been fitted. One is for example often interested in the stability of selected features and in assessing the prediction performance of a model and we provide functions to deal with both of these tasks. Our R functions are computationally efficient and off er the possibility of speeding up computing time through parallel computing. Another feature which can drastically reduce computing time is an e fficient interval-search algorithm, which we have implemented for selecting the optimal parameter combination for elastic net penalties. These functions have been useful in our daily work at the Biostatistics department (C060) of the German Cancer Research Center where prognostic modeling of patient survival data is of particular interest.

We aimed to assess the predictive value of midregional pro-A-type natriuretic peptide (MR-proANP) for recurrent cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in stable CHD patients for whom information on N-terminal proBNP (NT-proBNP) was already available.

METHODS: Plasma concentrations of MR-proANP and NT-proBNP were measured at baseline in a cohort of 1048 patients aged 30-70 years with CHD who were participating in an in-hospital rehabilitation program. Main outcome measures were cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke.

RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 8.1 years, 150 patients (incidence 21.1 per 1000 patient-years) experienced a secondary CVD event. MR-proANP was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.89 (95% CI, 1.01-3.57) when the top quartile was compared to the bottom quartile in the fully adjusted model (P for trend = 0.011). For NT-proBNP the respective HR was 2.22 (95% CI, 1.19-4.14) with a P for trend = 0.001. Finally, MR-proANP improved various model performance measures, including c-statistics and reclassification metrics, but without being superior to NT-proBNP.

CONCLUSIONS: Although we found an independent association of MR-proANP as well as NT-proBNP when used as single markers with recurrent CVD events after adjustment for established risk factors, the results of a simultaneous assessment of both markers indicated that MR-proANP fails to provide additional prognostic information to NT-proBNP in the population studied.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>60 (11), 1441-1449</Feld596><PubVol>60</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>1441</StrtPage><EndPage>1449</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Karakas M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Jaensch A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Breitling LP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Koenig W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Rothenbacher D" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25139456</PMID><DOI>10.1373/clinchem.2013.220202</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>BNP</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PLASMA-CONCENTRATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Risk prediction</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FAILURE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIAGNOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MARKER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BIOMARKERS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51842</publishedID><Artikel>213Bi-DOTATOC receptor-targeted alpha-radionuclide therapy induces remission in neuroendocrine tumours refractory to beta radiation: a first-in-human experience</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>41 (11), 2106-2119</Feld596><PubVol>41</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>2106</StrtPage><EndPage>2119</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kratochwil,C."

The aim of this study was to assess the effects of longitudinal wb-MRIs on progression into multiple myeloma (MM). Sixty-three patients with SMM were analyzed who received at least two wb-MRIs for follow-up before progression into MM. Radiological progressive disease (MRI-PD) was defined as detection of new FL or increase in diameter of existing FL and a novel or progressive diffuse infiltration. Radiological stable disease (MRI-SD) was defined by no change compared with the prior MRI. Patients were followed-up every 3-6 months, including a serological and clinical evaluation. One Hundred and eighty-two wb-MRIs were analyzed. MRI-PD occurred in 31 patients (49%), and 25 (40%) patients developed MM. MRI-PD was highly significantly associated with progression into MM, regardless of findings at the initial MRI. In multivariate analysis, MRI-PD remained a risk factor, independent of relevant baseline parameters like serum monoclonal protein or &gt;= 95% aberrant plasma cells in the bone marrow. Patients with MRI-SD had no higher risk of progression, even when FL were present at the initial MRI. Therefore, MRI is suitable for the follow-up of patients with SMM.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>28 (9), 1902-1908</Feld596><PubVol>28</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>1902</StrtPage><EndPage>1908</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Merz,M."

Molecular biomarkers including isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 or 2 (IDH1/2) mutation, 1p/19q codeletion, and O-6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation may improve prognostication and guide treatment decisions for patients with World Health Organization (WHO) anaplastic gliomas. At present, each marker is individually tested by distinct assays. Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip arrays (HM450) enable the determination of large-scale methylation profiles and genome-wide DNA copy number changes. Algorithms have been developed to detect the glioma CpG island methylator phenotype (G-CIMP) associated with IDH1/2 mutation, 1p/19q codeletion, and MGMT promoter methylation using a single assay.

Methods. Here, we retrospectively investigated the diagnostic and prognostic performance of these algorithms in comparison to individual marker testing and patient outcome in the biomarker cohort (n = 115 patients) of the NOA-04 trial.

Results. Concordance for IDH and 1p/19q status was very high: In 92% of samples, the HM450 and reference data agreed. In discordant samples, survival analysis by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses suggested a more accurate assessment of biological phenotype by the HM450 analysis. The HM450-derived MGMT-STP27 model to calculate MGMT promoter methylation probability revealed this aberration in a significantly higher fraction of samples than conventional methylation-specific PCR, with 87 of 91 G-CIMP tumors predicted as MGMT promoter-methylated. Pyrosequencing of discordant samples confirmed the HM450 assessment in 14 of 17 cases.

Conclusions. G-CIMP and 1p/19q codeletion are reliably detectable by HM450 analysis and are associated with prognosis in the NOA-04 trial. For MGMT, HM450 suggests promoter methylation in the vast majority of G-CIMP tumors, which is supported by pyrosequencing.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>16 (12), 1630-1638</Feld596><PubVol>16</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>1630</StrtPage><EndPage>1638</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Wiestler,B."

Whether a molecular classification of anaplastic gliomas based on large-scale genomic or epigenomic analyses is superior to histopathology for reflecting distinct biological groups, predicting outcomes and guiding therapy decisions has yet to be determined. Epigenome-wide DNA methylation analysis, using a platform which also allows the detection of copy-number aberrations, was performed in a cohort of 228 patients with anaplastic gliomas (astrocytomas, oligoastrocytomas, and oligodendrogliomas), including 115 patients of the NOA-04 trial. We further compared these tumors with a group of 55 glioblastomas. Unsupervised clustering of DNA methylation patterns revealed two main groups correlated with IDH status: CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) positive (77.5 %) or negative (22.5 %). CIMP(pos) (IDH mutant) tumors showed a further separation based on copy-number status of chromosome arms 1p and 19q. CIMP(neg) (IDH wild type) tumors showed hallmark copy-number alterations of glioblastomas, and clustered together with CIMP(neg) glioblastomas without forming separate groups based on WHO grade. Notably, there was no molecular evidence for a distinct biological entity representing anaplastic oligoastrocytoma. Tumor classification based on CIMP and 1p/19q status was significantly associated with survival, allowing a better prediction of outcome than the current histopathological classification: patients with CIMP(pos) tumors with 1p/19q codeletion (CIMP-codel) had the best prognosis, followed by patients with CIMP(pos) tumors but intact 1p/19q status (CIMP-non-codel). Patients with CIMP(neg) anaplastic gliomas (GBM-like) had the worst prognosis. Collectively, our data suggest that anaplastic gliomas can be grouped by IDH and 1p/19q status into three molecular groups that show clear links to underlying biology and a significant association with clinical outcome in a prospective trial cohort.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>128 (4), 561-571</Feld596><PubVol>128</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>561</StrtPage><EndPage>571</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Wiestler,B."

The recent evolution of RPPA combined with more sophisticated sample handling, optical detection, quality control, and better quality affinity reagents provides exquisite sensitivity and high sample throughput at a reasonable cost per sample. This facilitates large-scale multiplex analysis of multiple post-translational markers across samples from in vitro, preclinical, or clinical samples. The technical power of RPPA is stimulating the application and widespread adoption of RPPA methods within academic, clinical, and industrial research laboratories. Advances in RPPA technology now offer scientists the opportunity to quantify protein analytes with high precision, sensitivity, throughput, and robustness. As a result, adopters of RPPA technology have recognized critical success factors for useful and maximum exploitation of RPPA technologies, including the following: preservation and optimization of pre-analytical sample quality, application of validated high-affinity and specific antibody (or other protein affinity) detection reagents, dedicated informatics solutions to ensure accurate and robust quantification of protein analytes, and quality-assured procedures and data analysis workflows compatible with application within regulated clinical environments. In 2011, 2012, and 2013, the first three Global RPPA workshops were held in the United States, Europe, and Japan, respectively. These workshops provided an opportunity for RPPA laboratories, vendors, and users to share and discuss results, the latest technology platforms, best practices, and future challenges and opportunities. The outcomes of the workshops included a number of key opportunities to advance the RPPA field and provide added benefit to existing and future participants in the RPPA research community. The purpose of this report is to share and disseminate, as a community, current knowledge and future directions of the RPPA technology.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>13 (7), 1625-1643</Feld596><PubVol>13</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>1625</StrtPage><EndPage>1643</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Akbani R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Becker KF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Carragher N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Goldstein T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="de Koning L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Korf U" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Liotta L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Mills GB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Nishizuka SS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Pawlak M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Petricoin EF 3rd" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Pollard HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Serrels B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Zhu J" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24777629</PMID><DOI>10.1074/mcp.O113.034918</DOI><KST>B050</KST><KEYWORD>DRUG DISCOVERY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN BREAST-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEOMIC ANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>2-DIMENSIONAL ELECTROPHORESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LYSATE MICROARRAYS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL LUNG-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PARAFFIN-EMBEDDED TISSUES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHWAY-ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POTENTIAL BIOMARKERS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SIGNALING ANALYSIS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51884</publishedID><Artikel>No causal association identified for human papillomavirus infections in lung cancer</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Research</Journal><ABSTr>Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections have been implicated in lung carcinogenesis, but causal associations remain uncertain. We evaluated a potential causal role for HPV infections in lung cancer through an analysis involving serology, tumor DNA, RNA, and p16 protein expression. Association between type-specific HPV antibodies and risk of lung cancer was examined among 3,083 cases and 4,328 controls in two case-control studies (retrospective) and one nested case-control study (prospective design). Three hundred and thirty-four available tumors were subjected to pathologic evaluation and subsequent HPV genotyping following stringent conditions to detect all high-risk and two low-risk HPV types. All HPV DNA-positive tumors were further tested for the expression of p16 protein and type-specific HPV mRNA. On the basis of the consistency of the results, although HPV11 and HPV31 E6 antibodies were associated with lung cancer risk in the retrospective study, no association was observed in the prospective design. Presence of type-specific antibodies correlated poorly with the presence of the corresponding HPV DNA in the tumor. Although nearly 10% of the lung tumors were positive for any HPV DNA (7% for HPV16 DNA), none expressed the viral oncogenes. No association was observed between HPV antibodies or DNA and lung cancer survival. In conclusion, we found no supportive evidence for the hypothesized causal association between HPV infections and lung cancer.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>74 (13), 3525-3534</Feld596><PubVol>74</PubVol><PubIss>13</PubIss><StrtPage>3525</StrtPage><EndPage>3534</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Anantharaman D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Gheit T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Waterboer T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Halec G" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Carreira C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Abedi-Ardekani B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="McKay-Chopin S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Zaridze D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Mukeria A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Szeszenia-Dabrowska N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Lissowska J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Mates D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Janout V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Foretova L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Bencko V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Rudnai P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Fabianova E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Travis RC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Quiros JR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Johansson M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Krogh V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Kotanidou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Clavel-Chapelon F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Johansson M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Pawlita M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="29" name="Scelo G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Tommasino M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Brennan P" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24760422</PMID><DOI>10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-3548</DOI><KST>F020</KST><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CARCINOMAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEAD</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PREVALENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WOMEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TYPE-16</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTERNATIONAL AGENCY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NECK-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECURRENT RESPIRATORY PAPILLOMATOSIS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51887</publishedID><Artikel>Risk of malignancies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with thiopurines or anti-TNF alpha antibodies</Artikel><Journal>Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: We aimed to analyse malignancy rates and predictors for the development of malignancies in a large German inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) cohort treated with thiopurines and/or anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antibodies. METHODS: De novo malignancies in 666 thiopurine-treated and/or anti-TNF-treated IBD patients were analysed. Patients (n = 262) were treated with thiopurines alone and never exposed to anti-TNF antibodies (TP group). In addition, patients (n = 404) were exposed to anti-TNF antibodies (TNF+ group) with no (7.4%), discontinued (80.4%) or continued (12.1%) thiopurine therapy. RESULTS: In the TP group, 20 malignancies were observed in 18 patients compared with 8 malignancies in 7 patients in the TNF+ group (hazard ratio 4.15; 95% CI 1.82-9.44; p = 0.0007; univariate Cox regression). Moreover, 18.2% of all patients in the TP group &gt;/=50 years of age developed a malignancy, compared with 3.8% of all patients &lt;50 years of age (p = 0.0008). In the TNF+ group, 6.5% of all patients &gt;/=50 years of age developed malignancies compared with 0.3% of all patients &lt;50 years of age (p = 0.0007). In both groups combined, thiopurine treatment duration &gt;/=4 years was associated with the risk for skin cancer (p = 0.0024) and lymphoma (p = 0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate an increased risk for the development of malignancies in IBD patients treated with thiopurines in comparison with patients treated with anti-TNF antibodies with or without thiopurines.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (7), 735-744</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>735</StrtPage><EndPage>744</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Beigel F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Steinborn A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Schnitzler F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Tillack C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Breiteneicher S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="John JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Van Steen K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Laubender RP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Goeke B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Seiderer J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Brand S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Ochsenkuhn T" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24788825</PMID><DOI>10.1002/pds.3621</DOI><KST>L701</KST><KEYWORD>RETROSPECTIVE COHORT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>T-CELL LYMPHOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NONMELANOMA SKIN CANCERS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INFECTIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ULCERATIVE-COLITIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CROHNS-DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SAFETY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INFLIXIMAB</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AZATHIOPRINE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51888</publishedID><Artikel>Advances in 4D Treatment Planning for Scanned Particle Beam Therapy - Report of Dedicated Workshops</Artikel><Journal>Technology in Cancer Research and Treatment</Journal><ABSTr>We report on recent progress in the field of mobile tumor treatment with scanned particle beams, as discussed in the latest editions of the 4D treatment planning workshop. The workshop series started in 2009, with about 20 people from 4 research institutes involved, all actively working on particle therapy delivery and development. The first workshop resulted in a summary of recommendations for the treatment of mobile targets, along with a list of requirements to apply these guidelines clinically. The increased interest in the treatment of mobile tumors led to a continuously growing number of attendees: the 2012 edition counted more than 60 participants from 20 institutions and commercial vendors. The focus of research discussions among workshop participants progressively moved from 4D treatment planning to complete 4D treatments, aiming at effective and safe treatment delivery. Current research perspectives on 4D treatments include all critical aspects of time resolved delivery, such as in-room imaging, motion detection, beam application, and quality assurance techniques. This was motivated by the start of first clinical treatments of hepato cellular tumors with a scanned particle beam, relying on gating or abdominal compression for motion mitigation. Up to date research activities emphasize significant efforts in investigating advanced motion mitigation techniques, with a specific interest in the development of dedicated tools for experimental validation. Potential improvements will be made possible in the near future through 4D optimized treatment plans that require upgrades of the currently established therapy control systems for time resolved delivery. But since also these novel optimization techniques rely on the validity of the 4DCT, research focusing on alternative 4D imaging technique, such as MRI based 4DCT generation will continue.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>13 (6), 485-495</Feld596><PubVol>13</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>485</StrtPage><EndPage>495</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Bert C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Graeff C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Riboldi M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Nill S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Baroni G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Knopf AC" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24354749</PMID><DOI>10.7785/tcrtexpress.2013.60027</DOI><KST>E040</KST><KEYWORD>STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RADIATION-THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL LUNG-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>carbon ion radiotherapy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RESPIRATORY MOTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TIME TUMOR-TRACKING</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>4-DIMENSIONAL COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DEFORMABLE IMAGE REGISTRATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTON-BEAM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOVING TARGETS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51889</publishedID><Artikel>Aryl hydrocarbon receptor control of a disease tolerance defence pathway</Artikel><Journal>Nature</Journal><ABSTr>Disease tolerance is the ability of the host to reduce the effect of infection on host fitness. Analysis of disease tolerance pathways could provide new approaches for treating infections and other inflammatory diseases. Typically, an initial exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces a state of refractoriness to further LPS challenge (endotoxin tolerance). We found that a first exposure of mice to LPS activated the ligand-operated transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and the hepatic enzyme tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase, which provided an activating ligand to the former, to downregulate early inflammatory gene expression. However, on LPS rechallenge, AhR engaged in long-term regulation of systemic inflammation only in the presence of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1). AhR-complex-associated Src kinase activity promoted IDO1 phosphorylation and signalling ability. The resulting endotoxin-tolerant state was found to protect mice against immunopathology in Gram-negative and Gram-positive infections, pointing to a role for AhR in contributing to host fitness.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>511 (7508), 184-190</Feld596><PubVol>511</PubVol><PubIss>7508</PubIss><StrtPage>184</StrtPage><EndPage>190</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Bessede A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Gargaro M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Pallotta MT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Matino D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Servillo G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Brunacci C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Bicciato S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Mazza EM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Macchiarulo A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Vacca C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Iannitti R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Tissi L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Volpi C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Belladonna ML" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Orabona C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Bianchi R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Lanz TV" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="17" name="Platten M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="18" name="Della Fazia MA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Piobbico D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Zelante T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Funakoshi H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Nakamura T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Gilot D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Denison MS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Guillemin GJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="DuHadaway JB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Prendergast GC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Metz R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Geffard M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Boon L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Pirro M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Iorio A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Veyret B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Romani L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Grohmann U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Fallarino F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Puccetti P" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24930766</PMID><DOI>10.1038/nature13323</DOI><KST>G160</KST><KEYWORD>IDO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>kynurenine</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AH RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRYPTOPHAN CATABOLISM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INDOLEAMINE 2,3-DIOXYGENASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REGULATORY T-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIGAND-BINDING</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INFECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DENDRITIC CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENDOTOXIN TOLERANCE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51890</publishedID><Artikel>Multitarget stool DNA testing for colorectal-cancer screening</Artikel><Journal>New England Journal of Medicine</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>371 (2), 184-185</Feld596><PubVol>371</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>184</StrtPage><EndPage>185</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Werner S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Chen H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25006737</PMID><KST>C070</KST></row><row><publishedID>51891</publishedID><Artikel>Serological prevalence and persistence of high-risk human papillomavirus infection among women in Santiago, Chile</Artikel><Journal>BMC Infectious Diseases</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) serology is a main factor for designing vaccination programs and surveillance strategies; nevertheless, there are few reports of HPV seroprevalence in the general population, especially in Latin America. This study aimed to describe high-risk HPV serological prevalence, persistence, and association with concurrent cervical infection, in Chilean women. METHODS: 1021 women from the general population, aged 15-85 years, were studied in 2001 of whom 600 were reexamined in 2006. The assessments at both time points included cervical HPV DNA testing, HPV antibody testing, cervical cytology and a sociodemographic/behavioral questionnaire. HPV DNA and antibodies against L1 protein of types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 45, 52, and 58 were assessed by reverse line blot and multiplex serology, respectively. RESULTS: Seropositivity was high at both baseline (43.2%) and follow-up (50.2%) and increased with age (p &lt; 0.001); corresponding DNA prevalences were 6.7% and 8.7%. DNA and seroprevalence were associated at baseline (p = 0.01 for any HPV). Early age at first sexual intercourse and having had two or more sexual partners were independently associated with seropositivity. Most (82.0%) initially seropositive women remained seropositive at follow-up; 21.6% of initially seronegative women seroconverted, reaching 17.5% among women older than 60 years of age. ASCUS or worse cytology was correlated with HPV DNA positivity but not with HPV seropositivity. CONCLUSION: HPV seroprevalence studies are a useful tool for learning about the dynamics of HPV infection in a community. This study contributes to understanding the natural history of HPV infection and provides a baseline assessment before the incorporation of HPV vaccination into a national program.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>14 (1), Art.Nr.: 361-</Feld596><PubVol>14</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>Art.Nr.: 361</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Castro FA" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Dominguez A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Puschel K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Van De Wyngard V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Snijders PJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Franceschi S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Pawlita M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Ferreccio C" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24990706</PMID><DOI>10.1186/1471-2334-14-361</DOI><KST>F020</KST><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>ANTIBODY-RESPONSES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INVASIVE CERVICAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NATURAL-HISTORY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>YOUNG-WOMEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HPV INFECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WORLDWIDE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POPULATION-BASED COHORT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHINESE WOMEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SEROPREVALENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COSTA-RICA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51892</publishedID><Artikel>A meta-analysis of Hodgkin lymphoma reveals 19p13.3 TCF3 as a novel susceptibility locus</Artikel><Journal>Nature Communications</Journal><ABSTr>Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) have identified associations with genetic variation at both HLA and non-HLA loci; however, much of heritable HL susceptibility remains unexplained. Here we perform a meta-analysis of three HL GWAS totaling 1,816 cases and 7,877 controls followed by replication in an independent set of 1,281 cases and 3,218 controls to find novel risk loci. We identify a novel variant at 19p13.3 associated with HL (rs1860661; odds ratio (OR)=0.81, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.76-0.86, P(combined) = 3.5 x 10(-10)), located in intron 2 of TCF3 (also known as E2A), a regulator of B- and T-cell lineage commitment known to be involved in HL pathogenesis. This meta-analysis also notes associations between previously published loci at 2p16, 5q31, 6p31, 8q24 and 10p14 and HL subtypes. We conclude that our data suggest a link between the 19p13.3 locus, including TCF3, and HL risk.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>5 (), Art.

Whether there are other HL-related ADs and whether the increased risk of HL after ADs holds across sex, age, year of diagnosis, or HL histological subtype is unclear.

We systematically analyzed the risk of HL in 878 161 Swedish patients diagnosed with 33 different ADs in 1964-2010. During similar to 10-year follow-up of ADs patients, 371 incident HL cases were diagnosed.

Significantly increased overall standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for HL after ADs was 2.0 (95% confidence interval: 1.8-2.2); AD-specific SIRs: autoimmune hemolytic anemia 19.9 (7.2-43.6), sarcoidosis 10.3 (7.8-13.4), systemic lupus erythematosus 8.4 (5.2-12.9), immune thrombocytopenic purpura 7.0 (3.2-13.3), polyarteritis nodosa 6.6 (1.2-19.5), polymyositis/dermatomyositis 6.3 (2.0-14.9), Behcet's disease 5.6 (2.7-10.3), Sjogren's syndrome 5.0 (2.1-9.8), rheumatoid arthritis 3.2 (2.6-3.9), polymyalgia rheumatica 2.2 (1.4-3.5), and psoriasis 1.9 (1.3-2.6). Men with AD had slightly higher risk of HL (2.4, 2.0-2.7) compared with women (1.8, 1.5-2.0). Only 23% of ADs were diagnosed before age 35 years and the overall SIR for HL diagnosis before age 35 [1.4, (1.0-1.8)] was lower than that in older ages [35 a parts per thousand currency sign age &lt; 50: 2.1 (1.6-2.7); age a parts per thousand yen 50: 2.2 (2.0-2.5)], except for sarcoidosis [age &lt; 35: 19.3 (10.5-32.5); 35 a parts per thousand currency sign age &lt; 50: 10.4 (5.7-17.5); age a parts per thousand yen 50: 8.4 (5.6-12.1)]. Risks of all classical HLs significantly increased after ADs: lymphocyte depletion 3.7 (1.5-7.6), lymphocyte-rich 3.7 (2.3-5.9), mixed cellularity 2.4 (1.8-3.2), and nodular sclerosis 1.7 (1.3-2.1).

Several, but not all ADs (11/33), had a positive association with all classical histological subtypes of HL. Higher risks of classical HL after polyarteritis nodosa, polymyositis/dermatomyositis, Behcet's disease, Sjogren's syndrome, polymyalgia rheumatica, and psoriasis were novel findings of this study.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>25 (7), 1397-1404</Feld596><PubVol>25</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>1397</StrtPage><EndPage>1404</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Fallah,M."

However, using antibodies of high specificity in immunolocalization experiments, we have discovered that, in mammals, LUMA is a component of zonula adhaerens and punctum adhaerens plaques of diverse epithelia and epithelial cell cultures and is also located in (or in some species associated with) the plaques of composite junctions (CJs) in myocardiac intercalated disks (IDs). In CJs, LUMA often colocalizes with several other CJ marker proteins. In all these cells, LUMA has not been detected in the nuclear envelope. Surprisingly, under certain conditions, similar CJ localizations have also been seen with some antibodies commercially available for some time. The identification of LUMA as a plaque component of myocardiac CJs leads to reconsiderations of the molecular composition and architecture, the development, the functions, and the pathogenic states of CJs and IDs. These findings now also allow the general conclusion that LUMA has to be added to the list of mutations of cardiomyocyte junction proteins that may be involved in cardiomyopathies.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>357 (1), 159-172</Feld596><PubVol>357</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>159</StrtPage><EndPage>172</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Franke WW" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Doerflinger Y" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kuhn C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Zimbelmann R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Winter-Simanowski S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Frey N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Heid H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24770932</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00441-014-1865-1</DOI><KST>A991</KST><KEYWORD>RIGHT-VENTRICULAR CARDIOMYOPATHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GAP-JUNCTIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>adhering junctions</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEART-MUSCLE CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Molecular composition</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AREA-COMPOSITA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RYANODINE RECEPTOR GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ARRHYTHMOGENIC CARDIOMYOPATHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>T-CATENIN</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51896</publishedID><Artikel>Histone deacetylase inhibitor-temozolomide co-treatment inhibits melanoma growth through suppression of Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2-driven signals</Artikel><Journal>Oncotarget</Journal><ABSTr>Target-specific agents used in melanoma are not curative, and chemokines are being implicated in drug-resistance to target-specific agents. Thus, the use of conventional agents in rationale combinations may result in optimization of therapy. Because histone deacetylases participate in tumor development and progression, the combination of the pan-inhibitor SAHA and temozolomide might provide a therapeutic advantage. Here, we show synergism between the two drugs in mutant BRAF cell lines, in association with decreased phosphorylation of cell survival proteins (e.g., C-Jun-N-terminal-kinase, JNK). In the spontaneous ret transgenic mouse melanoma model, combination therapy produced a significant disease onset delay and down-regulation of Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), JNK, and of Myeloid-derived suppressor cell recruitment. Co-incubation with a CCL2-blocking-antibody enhanced in vitro cell sensitivity to temozolomide. Conversely, recombinant CCL2 activated JNK in human tumor melanoma cells. In keeping with these results, the combination of a JNK-inhibitor with temozolomide was synergistic. By showing that down-regulation of CCL2-driven signals by SAHA and temozolomide via JNK contributes to reduce melanoma growth, we provide a rationale for the therapeutic advantage of the drug combination. This combination strategy may be effective because of interference both with tumor cell and tumor microenvironment.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>5 (12), 4516-4528</Feld596><PubVol>5</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>4516</StrtPage><EndPage>4528</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Gatti L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Sevko A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="De Cesare M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Arrighetti N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Manenti G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Ciusani E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Verderio P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Ciniselli CM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Cominetti D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Carenini N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Corna E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Zaffaroni N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Rodolfo M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Rivoltini L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Umansky V" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Perego P" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24980831</PMID><KST>G300</KST><KEYWORD>ANTIINFLAMMATORY PROPERTIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMBINATION THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MONOCYTE CHEMOATTRACTANT PROTEIN-1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REGULATORY T-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>chronic inflammation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BRAF</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECRUITMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METASTATIC MELANOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MODULATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51897</publishedID><Artikel>mTORC1 maintains renal tubular homeostasis and is essential in response to ischemic stress</Artikel><Journal>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</Journal><ABSTr>Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a key regulator of cell metabolism and autophagy. Despite widespread clinical use of mTORC1 inhibitors, the role of mTORC1 in renal tubular function and kidney homeostasis remains elusive. By using constitutive and inducible deletion of conditional Raptor alleles in renal tubular epithelial cells, we discovered that mTORC1 deficiency caused a marked concentrating defect, loss of tubular cells, and slowly progressive renal fibrosis. Transcriptional profiling revealed that mTORC1 maintains renal tubular homeostasis by controlling mitochondrial metabolism and biogenesis as well as transcellular transport processes involved in countercurrent multiplication and urine concentration. Although mTORC2 partially compensated for the loss of mTORC1, exposure to ischemia and reperfusion injury exaggerated the tubular damage in mTORC1-deficient mice and caused pronounced apoptosis, diminished proliferation rates, and delayed recovery. These findings identify mTORC1 as an important regulator of tubular energy metabolism and as a crucial component of ischemic stress responses.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>111 (27), E2817-E2826</Feld596><PubVol>111</PubVol><PubIss>27</PubIss><StrtPage>E2817</StrtPage><EndPage>E2826</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Grahammer F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Haenisch N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Steinhardt F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Sander L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Roerden M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Arnold F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Cordts T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Wanner N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Reichardt W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Kerjaschki D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Ruegg MA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Hall MN" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Moulin P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Busch H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="14" name="Boerries M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Walz G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Artunc F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Huber TB" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24958889</PMID><DOI>10.1073/pnas.1402352111</DOI><KST>L601</KST><KEYWORD>GROWTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHWAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMPLEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>kidney</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OXYGEN-CONSUMPTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SODIUM-TRANSPORT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RAPAMYCIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BINDING PARTNER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RAPTOR</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51898</publishedID><Artikel>Using a shape prior for robust modeling of the mitral annulus on 4D ultrasound data</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Computer Assisted Radiology and Surgery</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: Over 40,000 annuloplasty rings are implanted each year in the USA to treat mitral regurgitation. However, the used measuring techniques to select a suitable annuloplasty ring are imprecise and highly depending on the expert's experience. This can cause a re-occurrence of the mitral regurgitation or an annuloplasty ring dehiscence, and thus the necessity of a re-operation. We propose a method to create a 4D model of the mitral annulus from ultrasound data to enable precise measurement and patient-specific implant planning. METHODS: An initial mitral annulus model is placed interactively in the 4D image data by defining commissure points and the annulus plane for one time step in diastole and systole. The model is automatically optimized using distinct image features. A shape and pose prior of the mitral annulus is used to compensate for artifacts and to enforce a plausible anatomical morphology, while a temporal alignment ensures a natural motion of the 4D model. RESULTS: Ground truth data were created for 4D images of 42 patients with varying image quality. A parameter and shape prior training was performed on a third of the ground truth data, while the rest was used to validate the method. The average error of the resulting mitral annulus models was computed as 2.25 ( +/-0.38 ) mm. The average expert standard deviation was determined as 1.86 (+/-0.32 ) mm. CONCLUSION: The proposed method enables the 4D modeling of mitral annuli based on ultrasound data in less than 2 min. The resulting models are comparable to manually delineated models and can be used for measurements of annular geometries and patient-specific annuloplasty treatment planning.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (4), 635-644</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>635</StrtPage><EndPage>644</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Graser B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Wald D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Al-Maisary S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Grossgasteiger M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="de Simone R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Meinzer HP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Wolf I" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24122458</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s11548-013-0942-3</DOI><KST>E130</KST><KEYWORD>REGURGITATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>segmentation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANNULOPLASTY RINGS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VALVE REPAIR</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51899</publishedID><Artikel>Prevailing role of contact guidance in intrastromal T-cell trapping in human pancreatic cancer</Artikel><Journal>Clinical Cancer Research</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by extensive collagen-rich stroma. T cells that infiltrate pancreatic cancers frequently become trapped in the stroma and do not contact tumor cells. Here, we aimed to analyze how chemokines and extracellular matrix (ECM) collagen interact in mediating T-cell infiltration in PDAC. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: T-cell distribution and ECM structure within tumors were analyzed. Chemokine concentrations in human PDAC were compared with the levels of immune cell infiltration. We assessed the influences of selected chemokines and collagen on directed and random T-cell movement using in vitro migration systems. RESULTS: PDAC overproduced several T-cell-active chemokines, but their levels were not correlated with intratumoral T-cell infiltration. In the absence of collagen, directed migration of activated T cells was induced by chemokines. Interestingly, collagen itself promoted high migratory activity of T cells, but completely abolished chemokine-guided movement. This effect was not altered by a beta1-integrin blocking antibody. Activated T cells actively migrated in low-density collagen matrices, but migration was inhibited in dense collagen. Accordingly, T cells were heterogeneously distributed in the pancreatic cancer stroma, with the majority residing in areas of low-density collagen far from tumor clusters. CONCLUSION: The excessive desmoplasia in PDAC promotes T-cell migration by contact guidance, which abrogates tumor cell-directed movement. Furthermore, dense collagen networks represent a physical barrier, additionally rearranging T-cell distribution to favor tumor stroma. These mechanisms are mainly responsible for intrastromal T-cell trapping in pancreatic cancer and may hinder the development of T-cell-based immunotherapies.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>20 (13), 3422-3433</Feld596><PubVol>20</PubVol><PubIss>13</PubIss><StrtPage>3422</StrtPage><EndPage>3433</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hartmann N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Giese NA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Giese T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Poschke I" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Offringa R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Werner J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Ryschich E" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24763614</PMID><DOI>10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-2972</DOI><KST>G180</KST><KEYWORD>CHEMOKINE RECEPTORS CXCR3</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MATRIX ARCHITECTURE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>tumor</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>carcinoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MIGRATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMMUNE-RESPONSE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Nab-paclitaxel</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CCR5</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>collagen</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51900</publishedID><Artikel>Peptide-independent stabilization of MHC class I molecules breaches cellular quality control</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Cell Science</Journal><ABSTr>The intracellular trafficking of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) proteins is directed by three quality control mechanisms that test for their structural integrity, which is correlated to the binding of high-affinity antigenic peptide ligands. To investigate which molecular features of MHC-I these quality control mechanisms detect, we have followed the hypothesis that suboptimally loaded MHC-I molecules are characterized by their conformational mobility in the F-pocket region of the peptide-binding site. We have created a novel variant of an MHC-I protein, K(b)-Y84C, in which two alpha-helices in this region are linked by a disulfide bond that mimics the conformational and dynamic effects of bound high-affinity peptide. K(b)-Y84C shows a remarkable increase in the binding affinity to its light chain, beta-2 microglobulin (beta2m), and bypasses all three cellular quality control steps. Our data demonstrate (1) that coupling between peptide and beta2m binding to the MHC-I heavy chain is mediated by conformational dynamics; (2) that the folded conformation of MHC-I, supported by beta2m, plays a decisive role in passing the ER-to-cell-surface transport quality controls; and (3) that beta2m association is also tested by the cell surface quality control that leads to MHC-I endocytosis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>127 (Pt 13), 2885-2897</Feld596><PubVol>127</PubVol><PubIss>Pt 13</PubIss><StrtPage>2885</StrtPage><EndPage>2897</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hein Z" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Uchtenhagen H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Abualrous ET" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Saini SK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Janssen L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Van Hateren A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Wiek C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Hanenberg H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Momburg F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Achour A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Elliott T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Springer S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Boulanger D" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24806963</PMID><DOI>10.1242/jcs.145334</DOI><KST>D015</KST><KEYWORD>STRUCTURAL BASIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>conformational flexibility</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMPLEX CLASS-I</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>antigen presentation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTANT MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>T-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY HEAVY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DYNAMICS SIMULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TAPASIN DEPENDENCE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51901</publishedID><Artikel>Novel DNA motif binding activity observed in vivo with an estrogen receptor alpha mutant mouse</Artikel><Journal>Molecular Endocrinology</Journal><ABSTr>Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) interacts with DNA directly or indirectly via other transcription factors, referred to as "tethering." Evidence for tethering is based on in vitro studies and a widely used "KIKO" mouse model containing mutations that prevent direct estrogen response element DNA- binding. KIKO mice are infertile, due in part to the inability of estradiol (E2) to induce uterine epithelial proliferation. To elucidate the molecular events that prevent KIKO uterine growth, regulation of the pro-proliferative E2 target gene Klf4 and of Klf15, a progesterone (P4) target gene that opposes the pro-proliferative activity of KLF4, was evaluated. Klf4 induction was impaired in KIKO uteri; however, Klf15 was induced by E2 rather than by P4. Whole uterine chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing revealed enrichment of KIKO ERalpha binding to hormone response elements (HREs) motifs. KIKO binding to HRE motifs was verified using reporter gene and DNA-binding assays. Because the KIKO ERalpha has HRE DNA-binding activity, we evaluated the "EAAE" ERalpha, which has more severe DNA-binding domain mutations, and demonstrated a lack of estrogen response element or HRE reporter gene induction or DNA-binding. The EAAE mouse has an ERalpha null-like phenotype, with impaired uterine growth and transcriptional activity. Our findings demonstrate that the KIKO mouse model, which has been used by numerous investigators, cannot be used to establish biological functions for ERalpha tethering, because KIKO ERalpha effectively stimulates transcription using HRE motifs. The EAAE-ERalpha DNA-binding domain mutant mouse demonstrates that ERalpha DNA-binding is crucial for biological and transcriptional processes in reproductive tissues and that ERalpha tethering may not contribute to estrogen responsiveness in vivo.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>28 (6), 899-911</Feld596><PubVol>28</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>899</StrtPage><EndPage>911</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hewitt SC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Li L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Grimm SA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Winuthayanon W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Hamilton KJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Pockette B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Rubel CA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Pedersen LC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Fargo D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Lanz RB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="DeMayo FJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Schuetz G" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Korach KS" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24713037</PMID><DOI>10.1210/me.2014-1051</DOI><KST>A992</KST><KEYWORD>RESPONSIVE ELEMENTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REPRODUCTIVE AXIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FEMALE MOUSE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHWAYS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AMINO-ACIDS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPITHELIAL-CELL PROLIFERATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ER-ALPHA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>negative feedback</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51902</publishedID><Artikel>Functional analysis of the Drosophila embryonic germ cell transcriptome by RNA interference</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>In Drosophila melanogaster, primordial germ cells are specified at the posterior pole of the very early embryo. This process is regulated by the posterior localized germ plasm that contains a large number of RNAs of maternal origin. Transcription in the primordial germ cells is actively down-regulated until germ cell fate is established. Bulk expression of the zygotic genes commences concomitantly with the degradation of the maternal transcripts. Thus, during embryogenesis, maternally provided and zygotically transcribed mRNAs determine germ cell development collectively. In an effort to identify novel genes involved in the regulation of germ cell behavior, we carried out a large-scale RNAi screen targeting both maternal and zygotic components of the embryonic germ line transcriptome. We identified 48 genes necessary for distinct stages in germ cell development. We found pebble and fascetto to be essential for germ cell migration and germ cell division, respectively. Our data uncover a previously unanticipated role of mei-P26 in maintenance of embryonic germ cell fate. We also performed systematic co-RNAi experiments, through which we found a low rate of functional redundancy among homologous gene pairs. As our data indicate a high degree of evolutionary conservation in genetic regulation of germ cell development, they are likely to provide valuable insights into the biology of the germ line in general.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (6), e98579-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>e98579</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Jankovics F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Henn L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bujna A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Vilmos P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Spirohn K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Boutros M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Erdelyi M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24896584</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0098579</DOI><KST>B110</KST><KEYWORD>BRAIN-TUMOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSLATIONAL CONTROL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STEM-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MELANOGASTER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MESSENGER-RNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSEPITHELIAL MIGRATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NANOS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PEBBLE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51903</publishedID><Artikel>Identification of genes involved in the biology of atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumours using Drosophila melanogaster</Artikel><Journal>Nature Communications</Journal><ABSTr>Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumours (AT/RT) are malignant brain tumours.

SMARCB1 is a member of the evolutionarily conserved SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex, which has an important role in the control of cell differentiation and proliferation. Little is known, however, about the pathways involved in the oncogenic effects of SMARCB1 inactivation, which might also represent targets for treatment. Here we report a comprehensive genetic screen in the fruit fly that revealed several genes not yet associated with loss of snr1, the Drosophila homologue of SMARCB1. We confirm the functional role of identified genes (including merlin, kibra and expanded, known to regulate hippo signalling pathway activity) in human rhabdoid tumour cell lines and AT/RT tumour samples.

The Global Test was applied to detect schizophrenia-associated pathways using discovery and replication datasets comprising 5,040 and 5,082 individuals of European ancestry, respectively. Information concerning functional gene-sets was retrieved from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, Gene Ontology, and the Molecular Signatures Database. Fourteen of the gene-sets or pathways identified in the discovery dataset were confirmed in the replication dataset. These include functional processes involved in transcriptional regulation and gene expression, synapse organization, cell adhesion, and apoptosis. For two genes, i.e. CTCF and CACNB2, evidence for association with schizophrenia was available (at the gene-level) in both the discovery study and published data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium schizophrenia study. Furthermore, these genes mapped to four of the 14 presently identified pathways. Several of the SNPs assigned to CTCF and CACNB2 have potential functional consequences, and a gene in close proximity to CACNB2, i.e. ARL5B, was identified as a potential gene of interest. Application of the present hierarchical approach thus allowed: (1) identification of novel biological gene-sets or pathways with potential involvement in the etiology of schizophrenia, as well as replication of these findings in an independent cohort; (2) detection of genes of interest for future follow-up studies; and (3) the highlighting of novel genes in previously reported candidate regions for schizophrenia.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>10 (6), e1004345-</Feld596><PubVol>10</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>e1004345</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Juraeva D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Haenisch B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Zapatka M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Frank J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Witt SH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Muhleisen TW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Treutlein J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Strohmaier J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Meier S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Degenhardt F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Giegling I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Ripke S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Leber M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Lange C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Schulze TG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Mossner R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Nenadic I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Sauer H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Rujescu D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Maier W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Borglum A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Ophoff R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Cichon S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Nothen MM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Rietschel M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Mattheisen M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Brors B" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24901509</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pgen.1004345</DOI><KST>B080</KST><KST>B060</KST><KST>G200</KST><KEYWORD>ENRICHMENT ANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HAPMAP</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMMON VARIANTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WIDE ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GAMMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANNOTATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOTIF</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSPORT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISEASES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51906</publishedID><Artikel>Inadequate mito-biogenesis in primary dermal fibroblasts from old humans is associated with impairment of PGC1A-independent stimulation</Artikel><Journal>Experimental Gerontology</Journal><ABSTr>Extrinsic skin ageing converges on the dermis, a post-mitotic tissue compartment consisting of extracellular matrix and long-lived fibroblasts prone to damage accumulation and maladaptation.

Consistent with that, mitochondrial content and cell proliferation declined with donor age. This was associated with upregulation of AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK), increased mRNA levels of PPARgamma-coactivator 1alpha (PGC1A) and decreased levels of NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1. In the old cells the PGC1A-mediated mito-biogenetic response to direct AMPK-stimulation by AICAR was undiminished, while the PGC1A-independent mito-biogenetic response to starvation was attenuated and accompanied by increased ROS-production. In summary, these observations suggest an age-associated decline in PGC1A-independent mito-biogenesis, which is insufficiently compensated by upregulation of the AMPK/PGC1A-axis leading under baseline conditions to decreased mitochondrial content and reductive overload of residual respiratory capacity.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>56 (SI), 59-68</Feld596><PubVol>56</PubVol><PubIss>SI</PubIss><StrtPage>59</StrtPage><EndPage>68</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kalfalah F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Sobek S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bornholz B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Gotz-Rosch C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Tigges J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Fritsche E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Krutmann J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Kohrer K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Deenen R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Ohse S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Boerries M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Busch H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Boege F" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24699405</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.exger.2014.03.017</DOI><KST>L601</KST><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPOSURE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>transcription</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHOSPHORYLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SKELETAL-MUSCLE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OXIDATIVE-STRESS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>senescence</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN SKIN FIBROBLASTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA DELETIONS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51907</publishedID><Artikel>TP53 status regulates ACSL5-induced expression of mitochondrial mortalin in enterocytes and colorectal adenocarcinomas</Artikel><Journal>Cell and Tissue Research</Journal><ABSTr>Acyl-CoA synthetase 5 (ACSL5), a mitochondrially localized enzyme, catalyzes the synthesis of long-chain fatty acid thioesters and is physiologically involved in pro-apoptotic sensing of enterocytes. The aim of the present study is to identify an ACSL5-dependent regulation of mitochondrially expressed proteins and the characterization of related pathways in normal and diseased human intestinal mucosa. Proteomics of isolated mitochondria from ACSL5 transfectants and CaCo2 controls were performed. ACSL5-dependent protein synthesis was verified with quantitative reverse transcription plus the polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, short-interfering-RNA-mediated gene silencing and additional cell culture experiments. Lipid changes were analyzed with tandem mass spectrometry. ACSL5-related pathways were characterized in normal mucosa and sporadic adenocarcinomas of the human intestine. In CaCo2 cells transfected with ACSL5, mortalin (HSPA9) was about two-fold increased in mitochondria, whereas cytoplasmic mortalin levels were unchanged. Disturbance of acyl-CoA/sphingolipid metabolism, induced by ACSL5 over-expression, was characterized as crucial. ACSL5-related over-expression of mitochondrial mortalin was found in HEK293 and Lovo (wild-type TP53 [tumor protein p53]) and CaCo2 (p53-negative; TP53 mutated) cells but not in Colo320DM cells (mutated TP53). In normal human intestinal mucosa, an increasing gradient of both ACSL5 and mortalin from bottom to top was observed, whereas p53 (wild-type TP53) decreased. In sporadic intestinal adenocarcinomas with strong p53 immunostaining (mutated TP53), ACSL5-related mortalin expression was heterogeneous. ACSL5-induced mitochondrial mortalin expression is assumed to be a stress response to ACSL5-related changes in lipid metabolism and is regulated by the TP53 status. Uncoupling of ACSL5 and mitochondrial mortalin by mutated TP53 could be important in colorectal carcinogenesis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>357 (1), 267-278</Feld596><PubVol>357</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>267</StrtPage><EndPage>278</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Klaus C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Kaemmerer E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Reinartz A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schneider U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Plum P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Jeon MK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Hose J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Hartmann F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Schnoelzer M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Wagner N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Kopitz J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Gassler N" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24770931</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00441-014-1826-8</DOI><KST>B100</KST><KST>G105</KST><KEYWORD>ACYL-COA SYNTHETASE-5</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FATTY-ACID REGULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN SMALL-INTESTINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIPOTOXICITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIPID-METABOLISM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GEL-ELECTROPHORESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>p53</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MASS-SPECTROMETRY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLON-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER-CELLS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51908</publishedID><Artikel>Targeted Chromatin Capture (T2C): a novel high resolution high throughput method to detect genomic interactions and regulatory elements</Artikel><Journal>Epigenetics and Chromatin</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Significant efforts have recently been put into the investigation of the spatial organization and the chromatin-interaction networks of genomes. Chromosome conformation capture (3C) technology and its derivatives are important tools used in this effort. However, many of these have limitations, such as being limited to one viewpoint, expensive with moderate to low resolution, and/or requiring a large sequencing effort. Techniques like Hi-C provide a genome-wide analysis. However, it requires massive sequencing effort with considerable costs. Here we describe a new technique termed Targeted Chromatin Capture (T2C), to interrogate large selected regions of the genome. T2C provides an unbiased view of the spatial organization of selected loci at superior resolution (single restriction fragment resolution, from 2 to 6 kbp) at much lower costs than Hi-C due to the lower sequencing effort. RESULTS: We applied T2C on well-known model regions, the mouse beta-globin locus and the human H19/IGF2 locus. In both cases we identified all known chromatin interactions. Furthermore, we compared the human H19/IGF2 locus data obtained from different chromatin conformation capturing methods with T2C data. We observed the same compartmentalization of the locus, but at a much higher resolution (single restriction fragments vs. the common 40 kbp bins) and higher coverage. Moreover, we compared the beta-globin locus in two different biological samples (mouse primary erythroid cells and mouse fetal brain), where it is either actively transcribed or not, to identify possible transcriptional dependent interactions. We identified the known interactions in the beta-globin locus and the same topological domains in both mouse primary erythroid cells and in mouse fetal brain with the latter having fewer interactions probably due to the inactivity of the locus. Furthermore, we show that interactions due to the important chromatin proteins, Ldb1 and Ctcf, in both tissues can be analyzed easily to reveal their role on transcriptional interactions and genome folding. CONCLUSIONS: T2C is an efficient, easy, and affordable with high (restriction fragment) resolution tool to address both genome compartmentalization and chromatin-interaction networks for specific genomic regions at high resolution for both clinical and non-clinical research.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>7 (), Art.

When setting up such small animal experiments, various biological, technical and methodical aspects have to be considered. In this work we present a comprehensive topical review based on relevant publications on irradiation techniques used for preclinical cancer research in mice and rats. Clinical radiotherapy treatment devices for the application of external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy as well as dedicated research irradiation devices are feasible for small animal irradiation depending on the animal model and the experimental goals. In this work, appropriate solutions for the technological transfer of human radiation oncology to small animal radiation research are summarised.

This study was initiated to define the potential of mobilization of endogenous bone marrow (BM) stem cells by rHuG-CSF or of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) to reduce the effect of single-dose irradiation on mouse oral epithelium. A 3 x 3 mm2 area of the lower tongue surface of mice was irradiated with graded single doses (day 0). Mucosal ulceration was used as the endpoint for dose-response analyses. Stem cells were mobilized by rHuG-CSF (8 times/4 days), timed to achieve a maximum of circulating stem cells on days 0, +1, +4, +8 or +10. Alternatively, syngeneic BM was transplanted on these days. The ED50 (dose at which ulceration is expected in 50 % of the animals) for irradiation alone was 11.9 +/- 3.4 Gy. Mobilization of stem cells with a maximum of circulating stem cells on days +4, +8 or +10 significantly increased the ED50 to 25.5 +/- 10.1, 23.5 +/- 10.1 and 26.5 +/- 13.0 Gy. In contrast, a maximum of circulating stem cells on day 0 or day +1 had no effect. BMT did not result in a significant change in isoeffective doses in any of the protocols. In conclusion, the response of oral mucosal epithelium to a single-radiation exposure can be significantly reduced by post-exposure mobilization, but not by transplantation, of BM stem cells.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>53 (4), 629-634</Feld596><PubVol>53</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>629</StrtPage><EndPage>634</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schmidt M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Piro-Hussong A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Siegemund A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Gabriel P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Doerr W" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24929346</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00411-014-0552-7</DOI><KST>L301</KST><KEYWORD>INHIBITION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>proliferation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BONE-MARROW</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>KERATINOCYTE GROWTH-FACTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOBILIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FRACTIONATED-IRRADIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TONGUE EPITHELIUM</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51946</publishedID><Artikel>2q36.3 is associated with prognosis for oestrogen receptor-negative breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy</Artikel><Journal>Nature Communications</Journal><ABSTr>Large population-based registry studies have shown that breast cancer prognosis is inherited.

In this study, we compared two highly invasive and two poorly invasive breast cancer cell lines using comparative label-free LC-MS profiling in order to identify differentially expressed proteins that may be linked to the invasive phenotype in vitro. Forty-five proteins were found to be upregulated, and 34 proteins, downregulated. UV excision repair protein RAD23 homologue B (RAD23B) was found among the downregulated proteins in highly invasive breast cancer cell lines. In poorly invasive breast cancer cell lines, siRNA-mediated downregulation of RAD23B subsequently led to an increase in invasion and adhesion in vitro. Immunohistochemistry analysis of 164 specimens of invasive breast cancer showed that having a high percentage (&gt;80%) of RAD23B positive nuclei was significantly associated with histopathological grades 1 and 2 breast cancer and with low mitotic activity. In addition, a high staining intensity for RAD23B in the cytoplasm was significantly associated with histopathological grade 3 breast cancer. This study suggests a potential role of RAD23B in breast cancer progression and may further imply a tumor suppressor role of nuclear RAD23B in breast cancer.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>13 (7), 3212-3222</Feld596><PubVol>13</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>3212</StrtPage><EndPage>3222</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Linge A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Maurya P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Friedrich K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Baretton GB" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kelly S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Henry M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Clynes M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Larkin A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Meleady P" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24897598</PMID><DOI>10.1021/pr4012156</DOI><KST>L301</KST><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL-ADHESION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NUCLEOTIDE EXCISION-REPAIR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MASS-SPECTROMETRY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA-REPAIR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ESTROGEN-RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GEL-ELECTROPHORESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LABEL-FREE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BIOMARKER DISCOVERY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>QUANTITATIVE PROTEOMIC ANALYSIS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51948</publishedID><Artikel>Quantification of vorinostat and its main metabolites in plasma and intracellular vorinostat in PBMCs by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry and its relation to histone deacetylase activity in human blood</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Chromatography / B, Analytical Technologies in the Biomedical and Life Sciences</Journal><ABSTr>Vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid) is the first approved histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma after progressive disease following two systemic therapies. Intracellular access of vorinostat is essential to exert its epigenetic effects. Therefore, we studied the relationship between vorinostat extracellular (plasma) and intracellular (peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PBMCs) concentration and assessed its concentration-effect relationship by HDAC activity testing. Assays were developed and validated for the low nanomolar quantification of vorinostat and two inactive metabolites in human plasma and PBMCs. For the vorinostat extraction from plasma and PBMCs solid-phase extraction and liquid-liquid extraction methods were applied. Extraction recoveries ranged from 88.6% to 114.4% for all analytes and extraction methods. Extracts were chromatographed on a Phenomenex Luna column isocratically (plasma) or by gradient (PBMCs) consisting of acidic ammonium acetate, acetonitrile, and methanol. The analytes were quantified using deuterated internal standards and positive electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (multiple reaction monitoring) with lower limits of quantification of 11.0 ng/mL (plasma) and 0.1 ng/3 x 10(6) cells (PBMCs). The calibrated ranges were linear for vorinostat in plasma 11.0-1100 (11,000) ng/mL (metabolites) and PBMCs 0.1-10.0 ng/3 x 10(6) cells with correlation coefficients &gt;0.99, an overall accuracy varying between -6.7% and +3.8% in plasma, -8.1% and -1.5% in PBMCs, and an overall precision ranging from 3.2% to 6.1% in plasma and 0.8% to 4.0% in PBMCs (SD batch-to-batch). The application to blood samples from healthy volunteers incubated with vorinostat revealed accumulation of vorinostat in PBMCs, effective intracellular HDAC inhibition at therapeutic vorinostat concentrations and a direct vorinostat concentration dependency to HDAC inhibition.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>964 (), 212-221</Feld596><PubVol>964</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>212</StrtPage><EndPage>221</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Liu L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Detering JC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Milde T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Haefeli WE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Witt O" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Burhenne J" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24636840</PMID><KST>G340</KST><KEYWORD>RITONAVIR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SAHA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUBEROYLANILIDE HYDROXAMIC ACID</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN SERUM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HDAC inhibitor</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MONONUCLEAR-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASSAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL LUNG-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHASE-I</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51949</publishedID><Artikel>Hypoxia-inducible Lipid Droplet-associated (HILPDA) Is a Novel Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor (PPAR) Target Involved in Hepatic Triglyceride Secretion</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Biological Chemistry</Journal><ABSTr>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) play major roles in the regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism through the control of numerous genes involved in processes such as lipid uptake and fatty acid oxidation. Here we identify hypoxia-inducible lipid droplet-associated (Hilpda/Hig2) as a novel PPAR target gene and demonstrate its involvement in hepatic lipid metabolism. Microarray analysis revealed that Hilpda is one of the most highly induced genes by the PPARalpha agonist Wy14643 in mouse precision cut liver slices. Induction of Hilpda mRNA by Wy14643 was confirmed in mouse and human hepatocytes. Oral dosing with Wy14643 similarly induced Hilpda mRNA levels in livers of wild-type mice but not Ppara(-/-) mice. Transactivation studies and chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that Hilpda is a direct PPARalpha target gene via a conserved PPAR response element located 1200 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site. Hepatic overexpression of HILPDA in mice via adeno-associated virus led to a 4-fold increase in liver triglyceride storage, without any changes in key genes involved in de novo lipogenesis, beta-oxidation, or lipolysis. Moreover, intracellular lipase activity was not affected by HILPDA overexpression. Strikingly, HILPDA overexpression significantly impaired hepatic triglyceride secretion. Taken together, our data uncover HILPDA as a novel PPAR target that raises hepatic triglyceride storage via regulation of triglyceride secretion.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>289 (28), 19279-19293</Feld596><PubVol>289</PubVol><PubIss>28</PubIss><StrtPage>19279</StrtPage><EndPage>19293</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Mattijssen F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Georgiadi A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Andasarie T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Szalowska E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Zota A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Krones-Herzig A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Heier C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Ratman D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="De Bosscher K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Qi L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Zechner R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Herzig S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Kersten S" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24876382</PMID><DOI>10.1074/jbc.M114.570044</DOI><KST>A170</KST><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALPHA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MICE LACKING</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NUCLEAR RECEPTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIFFERENTIATION-RELATED PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FATTY-ACID OXIDATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INDUCED STEATOHEPATITIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADIPOSE LIPOLYSIS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51950</publishedID><Artikel>Mechanical ventilation causes airway distension with proinflammatory sequelae in mice</Artikel><Journal>American Journal of Physiology / Lung Cellular and Molecular Physiology</Journal><ABSTr>The pathogenesis of ventilator-induced lung injury has predominantly been attributed to overdistension or mechanical opening and collapse of alveoli, whereas mechanical strain on the airways is rarely taken into consideration. Here, we hypothesized that mechanical ventilation may cause significant airway distension, which may contribute to the pathological features of ventilator-induced lung injury. C57BL/6J mice were anesthetized and mechanically ventilated at tidal volumes of 6, 10, or 15 ml/kg body wt. Mice were imaged by flat-panel volume computer tomography, and central airways were segmented and rendered in 3D for quantitative assessment of airway distension. Alveolar distension was imaged by intravital microscopy. Functional dead space was analyzed in vivo, and proinflammatory cytokine release was analyzed in isolated, ventilated tracheae. CT scans revealed a reversible, up to 2.5-fold increase in upper airway volume during mechanical ventilation compared with spontaneous breathing. Airway distension was most pronounced in main bronchi, which showed the largest volumes at tidal volumes of 10 ml/kg body wt. Conversely, airway distension in segmental bronchi and functional dead space increased almost linearly, and alveolar distension increased even disproportionately with higher tidal volumes. In isolated tracheae, mechanical ventilation stimulated the release of the early-response cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1beta. Mechanical ventilation causes a rapid, pronounced, and reversible distension of upper airways in mice that is associated with an increase in functional dead space. Upper airway distension is most pronounced at moderate tidal volumes, whereas higher tidal volumes redistribute preferentially to the alveolar compartment. Airway distension triggers proinflammatory responses and may thus contribute relevantly to ventilator-induced pathologies.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>307 (1), L27-L37</Feld596><PubVol>307</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>L27</StrtPage><EndPage>L37</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Nickles HT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Sumkauskaite M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Wang X" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Wegner I" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Puderbach M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Kuebler WM" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24816486</PMID><DOI>10.1152/ajplung.00288.2013</DOI><KST>E010</KST><KEYWORD>LOWER TIDAL VOLUMES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LEUKOCYTE RECRUITMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACUTE LUNG INJURY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RESPIRATORY-DISTRESS-SYNDROME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>inflammation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PRESSURE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>cytokines</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOUSE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MODEL</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51951</publishedID><Artikel>Diverse intracellular pathogens activate type III interferon expression from peroxisomes</Artikel><Journal>Nature Immunology</Journal><ABSTr>Type I interferon responses are considered the primary means by which viral infections are controlled in mammals. Despite this view, several pathogens activate antiviral responses in the absence of type I interferons. The mechanisms controlling type I interferon-independent responses are undefined. We found that RIG-I like receptors (RLRs) induce type III interferon expression in a variety of human cell types, and identified factors that differentially regulate expression of type I and type III interferons. We identified peroxisomes as a primary site of initiation of type III interferon expression, and revealed that the process of intestinal epithelial cell differentiation upregulates peroxisome biogenesis and promotes robust type III interferon responses in human cells.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: AIO-PK0104 was a German multicenter phase III trial comparing gemcitabine/erlotinib followed by capecitabine (GEC) with capecitabine/erlotinib followed by gemcitabine (CEG) in advanced pancreatic cancer. Archival tumour tissue from 169 of the 274 eligible study patients was available for a central and standardised immunohistochemistry staining for hENT1 expression using the SP120 rabbit monoclonal anti-hENT1 antibody. Within a retrospective translational subgroup analysis, biomarker data were correlated with efficacy end-points. RESULTS: Thirty-nine out of 130 fresh-cut slides were scored as hENT1(high) (30%), whereas 91 samples were classified as hENT1(low) (70%). For the 62 patients randomised to CEG median overall survival was estimated with 6.4 months in the hENT1(low) compared to 6.9 months in the hENT1(high) subgroup (Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48-1.61, p=0.67). For the 68 patients randomised to GEC survival was 5.7 months in the hENT1(low) compared to 4.4 months in the hENT1(high) subgroup (HR 1.16, 95% CI 0.69-1.96, p=0.57). In 101 patients receiving gemcitabine at any time during study treatment (either within the 1st- or 2nd-line setting) hENT1(low) cases had a median overall survival of 7.5 months and hENT1(high) patients an overall survival of 4.4 months (HR 1.30, 95% CI 0.84-2.03, p=0.24), respectively.

Comprehensive knowledge of these networks is an essential step towards our understanding of developmental processes. However, this knowledge is mostly based on genome-wide mapping of transcription factor binding sites, and therefore requires prior knowledge regarding the TFs involved in the network. RESULTS: Focusing on how temporal control of gene expression is integrated within a developmental network, we applied an in silico approach to discover regulatory motifs and CRMs of co-expressed genes, with no prior knowledge about the involved TFs. Our aim was to identify regulatory motifs and potential trans-acting factors which regulate the temporal expression of co-expressed gene sets during a particular process of organogenesis, namely adult heart formation in Drosophila. Starting from whole genome tissue specific expression dynamics, we used an in silico method, cisTargetX, to predict TF binding motifs and CRMs. Potential Nuclear Receptor (NR) binding motifs were predicted to control the temporal expression profile of a gene set with increased expression levels during mid metamorphosis. The predicted CRMs and NR motifs were validated in vivo by reporter gene essays. In addition, we provide evidence that three NRs modulate CRM activity and behave as temporal regulators of target enhancers. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach was successful in identifying CRMs and potential TFs acting on the temporal regulation of target genes. In addition, our results suggest a modular architecture of the regulatory machinery, in which the temporal and spatial regulation can be uncoupled and encoded by distinct CRMs.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>15 (), Art.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two chest radiologists retrospectively evaluated CT exams of 123 patients with SQCC resected between 2002 and 2008. Tumors' size, location (central vs. peripheral), shape, margins, attenuation, enhancement, presence of calcification, cavitation, internal air bronchograms and pleural tags were assigned by consensus. Prevalence of features was compared with patients' survival data and a previously studied population of ADC surgically resected at the same time period. RESULTS: Cavitation correlated negatively with overall (hazard ratio=3.04), disease-specific (HR=3.67) and disease-free survival (HR=2.69), independent from age, gender, tumor pathological stage, size, and location. In relation to ADC, SQCC presented different shape, margins, attenuation, enhancement, with more cavitation, rare internal air bronchograms, and less pleural tags. Differences were also significant when comparing only the peripheral type of tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Cavitation at CT was an independent and negative predictive factor for SQCC. Different CT morphological features were described for SQCC and ADC. Image evaluation of lung lesions should go beyond measuring and addressing adjacent structures invasion. Adequate imaging characterization not only helps to differentiate benign versus malignant disease and to determine malignancy staging, it may also imply the histologic subtype and improve the prognostic assessment of lung cancer patients.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>83 (7), 1275-1281</Feld596><PubVol>83</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>1275</StrtPage><EndPage>1281</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Koenigkam Santos M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Muley T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Warth A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="de Paula WD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Lederlin M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Schnabel PA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Schlemmer HP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Kauczor HU" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Heussel CP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Puderbach M" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24840477</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.ejrad.2014.04.019</DOI><KST>E010</KST><KEYWORD>INVASION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CLASSIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>tumor</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHEMORADIOTHERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LUNG-CANCER PATIENTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SOCIETY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MANAGEMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SECTION CT FINDINGS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51956</publishedID><Artikel>Metalloprotease-mediated tumor cell shedding of B7-H6, the ligand of the natural killer cell-activating receptor NKp30</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Research</Journal><ABSTr>Natural killer (NK) cells are potent immune effector cells capable of mediating antitumor responses. Thus, during immunoediting, tumor cell populations evolve strategies to escape NK-cell-mediated recognition. In this study, we report a novel mechanism of immune escape involving tumor cell shedding of B7-H6, a ligand for the activating receptor NKp30 that mediates NK-cell binding and NK-cell-mediated killing. Tumor cells from different cancer entities released B7-H6 by ectodomain shedding mediated by the cell surface proteases "a disintegrin and metalloproteases" (ADAM)-10 and ADAM-17, as demonstrated through the use of pharmacologic inhibitors or siRNA-mediated gene attenuation. Inhibiting this proteolytic shedding process increased the levels of B7-H6 expressed on the surface of tumor cells, enhancing NKp30-mediated activation of NK cells. Notably, we documented elevated levels of soluble B7-H6 levels in blood sera obtained from a subset of patients with malignant melanoma, compared with healthy control individuals, along with evidence of elevated B7-H6 expression in melanoma specimens in situ. Taken together, our results illustrated a novel mechanism of immune escape in which tumor cells impede NK-mediated recognition by metalloprotease-mediated shedding of B7-H6. One implication of our findings is that therapeutic inhibition of specific metalloproteases may help support NK-cell-based cancer therapy.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>74 (13), 3429-3440</Feld596><PubVol>74</PubVol><PubIss>13</PubIss><StrtPage>3429</StrtPage><EndPage>3440</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schlecker E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Fiegler N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Arnold A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Altevogt P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Rose-John S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Moldenhauer G" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Sucker A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Paschen A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="von Strandmann EP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Textor S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Cerwenka A" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24780758</PMID><DOI>10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-3017</DOI><KST>D080</KST><KST>D015</KST><KST>D016</KST><KEYWORD>CHAIN-RELATED MOLECULE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MALIGNANT DISEASES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>myeloid cells</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NKG2D ligands</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DOWN-REGULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CUTTING EDGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BREAST-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANTITUMOR-ACTIVITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>UP-REGULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NK cells</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51957</publishedID><Artikel>Translational regulation of specific mRNAs controls feedback inhibition and survival during macrophage activation</Artikel><Journal>PloS Genetics</Journal><ABSTr>For a rapid induction and efficient resolution of the inflammatory response, gene expression in cells of the immune system is tightly regulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. The control of mRNA translation has emerged as an important determinant of protein levels, yet its role in macrophage activation is not well understood. We systematically analyzed the contribution of translational regulation to the early phase of the macrophage response by polysome fractionation from mouse macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Individual mRNAs whose translation is specifically regulated during macrophage activation were identified by microarray analysis. Stimulation with LPS for 1 h caused translational activation of many feedback inhibitors of the inflammatory response including NF-kappaB inhibitors (Nfkbid, Nfkbiz, Nr4a1, Ier3), a p38 MAPK antagonist (Dusp1) and post-transcriptional suppressors of cytokine expression (Zfp36 and Zc3h12a). Our analysis showed that their translation is repressed in resting and de-repressed in activated macrophages. Quantification of mRNA levels at a high temporal resolution by RNASeq allowed us to define groups with different expression patterns. Thereby, we were able to distinguish mRNAs whose translation is actively regulated from mRNAs whose polysomal shifts are due to changes in mRNA levels. Active up-regulation of translation was associated with a higher content in AU-rich elements (AREs). For one example, Ier3 mRNA, we show that repression in resting cells as well as de-repression after stimulation depends on the ARE. Bone-marrow derived macrophages from Ier3 knockout mice showed reduced survival upon activation, indicating that IER3 induction protects macrophages from LPS-induced cell death. Taken together, our analysis reveals that translational control during macrophage activation is important for cellular survival as well as the expression of anti-inflammatory feedback inhibitors that promote the resolution of inflammation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>10 (6), e1004368-</Feld596><PubVol>10</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>e1004368</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Schott J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Reitter S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Philipp J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Haneke K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schaefer H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Stoecklin G" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24945926</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pgen.1004368</DOI><KST>A200</KST><KEYWORD>ENDOTOXIN-SHOCK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTECTS MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TNF-ALPHA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRISTETRAPROLIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DECAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>KAPPA-B-ZETA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51959</publishedID><Artikel>Mechanisms of enzyme-catalyzed reduction of two carcinogenic nitro-aromatics, 3-nitrobenzanthrone and aristolochic acid I: Experimental and theoretical approaches</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</Journal><ABSTr>This review summarizes the results found in studies investigating the enzymatic activation of two genotoxic nitro-aromatics, an environmental pollutant and carcinogen 3-nitrobenzanthrone (3-NBA) and a natural plant nephrotoxin and carcinogen aristolochic acid I (AAI), to reactive species forming covalent DNA adducts.

The contribution of conjugation enzymes such as N,O-acetyltransferases (NATs) and sulfotransferases (SULTs) to the activation of 3-NBA and AAI was also examined. The results indicated differences in the abilities of 3-NBA and AAI metabolites to be further activated by these conjugation enzymes. The formation of DNA adducts generated by both carcinogens during their reductive activation by the NOQ1 and CYP1A1/2 enzymes was investigated with pure enzymes, enzymes present in subcellular cytosolic and microsomal fractions, selective inhibitors, and animal models (including knock-out and humanized animals). For the theoretical approaches, flexible in silico docking methods as well as ab initio calculations were employed. The results summarized in this review demonstrate that a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches is a useful tool to study the enzyme-mediated reaction mechanisms of 3-NBA and AAI reduction.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>15 (6), 10271-10295</Feld596><PubVol>15</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>10271</StrtPage><EndPage>10295</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Stiborova M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Frei E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Schmeiser HH" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Arlt VM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Martinek V" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24918288</PMID><DOI>10.3390/ijms150610271</DOI><KST>E030</KST><KST>G110</KST><KEYWORD>CHINESE HERBS NEPHROPATHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BALKAN ENDEMIC NEPHROPATHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>urothelial cancer</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN CANCER HAZARD</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CYTOCHROMES P450 1A1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AIR-POLLUTANT 3-NITROBENZANTHRONE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANT 3-NITROBENZANTHRONE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIESEL EXHAUST</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA ADDUCT FORMATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METABOLIC-ACTIVATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51960</publishedID><Artikel>Circulating prolactin and breast cancer risk among pre- and postmenopausal women in the EPIC cohort</Artikel><Journal>Annals of Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Experimental and epidemiological evidence suggests that prolactin might play a role in the etiology of breast cancer. We analyzed the relationship of prediagnostic circulating prolactin levels with the risk of breast cancer by menopausal status, use of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) at blood donation, and by estrogen and progesterone receptor status of the breast tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Conditional logistic regression was used to analyze the data from a case-control study nested within the prospective European EPIC cohort, including 2250 invasive breast cancer and their matched control subjects. RESULTS: Statistically significant heterogeneity in the association of prolactin levels with breast cancer risk between women who were either pre- or postmenopausal at the time of blood donation was observed (Phet = 0.04). Higher serum levels of prolactin were associated with significant increase in the risk of breast cancer among postmenopausal women [odds ratio (OR)Q4-Q1 = 1.29 (95% confidence interval, CI, 1.05-1.58), Ptrend = 0.09]; however, this increase in risk seemed to be confined to women who used postmenopausal HRT at blood donation [ORQ4-Q1 = 1.45 (95% CI 1.08-1.95), Ptrend = 0.01], whereas no statistically significant association was found for the non-users of HRT [ORQ4-Q1 = 1.11 (95%CI 0.83-1.49), Ptrend = 0.80] (Phet = 0.08). Among premenopausal women, a statistically non-significant inverse association was observed [ORQ4-Q1 = 0.70 (95% CI 0.48-1.03), Ptrend = 0.16]. There was no heterogeneity in the prolactin-breast cancer association by hormone receptor status of the tumor. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that higher circulating levels of prolactin among the postmenopausal HRT users at baseline may be associated with increased breast cancer risk.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>25 (7), 1422-1428</Feld596><PubVol>25</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>1422</StrtPage><EndPage>1428</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Tikk K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Sookthai D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Johnson T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Rinaldi S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Romieu I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Olsen A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Clavel-Chapelon F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Baglietto L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Lagiou P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Trichopoulos D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Palli D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Pala V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Rosso S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Panico S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Agudo A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Menendez V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Sanchez MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Amiano P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Huerta Castano JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Ardanaz E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Monninkhof E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Onland-Moret C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Andersson A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Sund M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Key TJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Travis RC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Gunter MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Dossus L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Kaaks R" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24718887</PMID><DOI>10.1093/annonc/mdu150</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>REPRODUCIBILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HORMONES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PLASMA PROLACTIN</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51961</publishedID><Artikel>Quiescent sox2(+) cells drive hierarchical growth and relapse in sonic hedgehog subgroup medulloblastoma</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Cell</Journal><ABSTr>Functional heterogeneity within tumors presents a significant therapeutic challenge. Here we show that quiescent, therapy-resistant Sox2(+) cells propagate sonic hedgehog subgroup medulloblastoma by a mechanism that mirrors a neurogenic program. Rare Sox2(+) cells produce rapidly cycling doublecortin(+) progenitors that, together with their postmitotic progeny expressing NeuN, comprise tumor bulk. Sox2(+) cells are enriched following anti-mitotic chemotherapy and Smoothened inhibition, creating a reservoir for tumor regrowth. Lineage traces from Sox2(+) cells increase following treatment, suggesting that this population is responsible for relapse. Targeting Sox2(+) cells with the antineoplastic mithramycin abrogated tumor growth. Addressing functional heterogeneity and eliminating Sox2(+) cells presents a promising therapeutic paradigm for treatment of sonic hedgehog subgroup medulloblastoma.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>26 (1), 33-47</Feld596><PubVol>26</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>33</StrtPage><EndPage>47</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Vanner RJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Remke M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Gallo M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Selvadurai HJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Coutinho F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Lee L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Kushida M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Head R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Morrissy S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Zhu X" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Aviv T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Voisin V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Clarke ID" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Li Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Mungall AJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Moore RA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Ma Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Jones SJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Marra MA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Malkin D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Northcott PA" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="21" name="Kool M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="22" name="Pfister SM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="23" name="Bader G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Hochedlinger K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Korshunov A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="26" name="Taylor MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Dirks PB" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24954133</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.ccr.2014.05.005</DOI><KST>G380</KST><KST>B062</KST><KEYWORD>HUMAN LEUKEMIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEUROSPHERE FORMATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SELF-RENEWAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADULT MAMMALIAN BRAIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MELANOMA-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MYELOID-LEUKEMIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER STEM-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR-INITIATING CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHWAY INHIBITOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGENITOR CELLS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51962</publishedID><Artikel>Serial enumeration of circulating tumor cells predicts treatment response and prognosis in metastatic breast cancer: a prospective study in 393 patients</Artikel><Journal>BMC Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: To prospectively assess circulating tumor cell (CTC) status at baseline (CTCBL) and after one cycle of a new line of systemic therapy (CTC1C), and changes from CTCBL to CTC1C (CTC kinetics, CTCKIN) for their utility in predicting response, progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in metastatic breast cancer (MBC). METHODS: CTCBL and CTC1C status was determined as negative (-) or positive (+) for &lt; 5 or &gt;/= 5 CTCs/7.5 ml blood using CellSearch (Veridex). CTCKIN was categorized as favorable (CTC1C-) or unfavorable (CTC1C+). Tumor response was to be assessed every 2-3 months using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. Statistical analysis focused on the relation between CTC status and CTCKIN, and response, PFS, and OS. RESULTS: 133/393 (34%) patients enrolled were CTCBL+. CTC1C status after one cycle and radiological tumor response were assessed after median (range) periods of 1.2 (0.5-3.2) and 2.9 (0.5-4.8) months, respectively. 57/201 (28%) were CTC1C+. Median [95% confidence interval] PFS and OS (months) were significantly reduced in CTCBL+ vs. CTCBL- patients (PFS 4.7 [3.7-6.1] vs. 7.8 [6.4-9.2]; OS 10.4 [7.9-15.0] vs. 27.2 [22.3-29.9]), and for CTC1C+ vs. CTC1C- patients (PFS 4.3 [3.6-6.0] vs. 8.5 [6.6-10.4]; OS 7.7 [6.4-13.9] vs. 30.6 [22.6-not available]). Unfavorable CTCKIN was significantly associated with progressive disease. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed prognostic factors for shorter PFS (CTCBL+, persistent CTCs after one cycle, &gt;/= 3rd-line therapy, and triple-negative receptor status) and shorter OS (CTCBL+, persistent CTCs after one cycle, bone-and-visceral/local metastases, &gt;/= 3rd-line therapy, and triple-negative receptor status). CONCLUSIONS: CTCBL, CTC1C, and CTCKIN are predictive of outcome in MBC. Serial CTC enumeration is useful in tailoring systemic treatment of MBC.

Alkylator resistance of glioma cells is mainly mediated by the DNA repair enzyme O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). Epigenetic silencing of the MGMT gene by promoter methylation in glioma cells compromises this DNA repair mechanism and increases chemosensitivity. MGMT promoter methylation is, therefore, a strong prognostic biomarker in paediatric and adult patients with glioblastoma treated with temozolomide. Notably, elderly patients (&gt;65-70 years) with glioblastoma whose tumours lack MGMT promoter methylation derive minimal benefit from such chemotherapy. Thus, MGMT promoter methylation status has become a frequently requested laboratory test in neuro-oncology. This Review presents current data on the prognostic and predictive relevance of MGMT testing, discusses clinical trials that have used MGMT status to select participants, evaluates known issues concerning the molecular testing procedure, and addresses the necessity for molecular-context-dependent interpretation of MGMT test results. Whether MGMT promoter methylation testing should be offered to all individuals with glioblastoma, or only to elderly patients and those in clinical trials, is also discussed. Justifications for withholding alkylating agent chemotherapy in patients with MGMT-unmethylated glioblastomas outside clinical trials, and the potential role for MGMT testing in other gliomas, are also discussed.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>10 (7), 372-385</Feld596><PubVol>10</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>372</StrtPage><EndPage>385</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Wick W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Weller M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="van den Bent M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Sanson M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Weiler M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="von Deimling A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Plass C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Hegi M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Platten M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Reifenberger G" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24912512</PMID><DOI>10.1038/nrneurol.2014.100</DOI><KST>C010</KST><KST>G380</KST><KST>G370</KST><KST>G160</KST><KST>L401</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>PHASE-II TRIAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECURRENT GLIOBLASTOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROMOTER METHYLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DOSE-INTENSE TEMOZOLOMIDE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA-REPAIR GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LOMUSTINE PLUS TEMOZOLOMIDE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEWLY-DIAGNOSED GLIOBLASTOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXTERNAL QUALITY ASSESSMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>O-6-METHYLGUANINE-DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METHYLATION-SPECIFIC PCR</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51964</publishedID><Artikel>Sensitivity of whole-body CT and MRI versus projection radiography in the detection of osteolyses in patients with monoclonal plasma cell disease</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Radiology</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: To compare sensitivity of whole-body Computed Tomography (wb-CT) and whole-body Magnetic Resonance Imaging (wb-MRI) with Projection Radiography (PR) regarding each method's ability to detect osteolyses in patients with monoclonal plasma cell disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The bone status of 171 patients was evaluated. All patients presented with multiple myeloma (MM) of all stages, monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) or solitary plasmacytoma. Two groups were formed. Group A consisted of 52 patients (26 females, 26 males) with an average age of 62 years (range, 45-89 years) who received, both, PR and wb-CT as part of their diagnostic work-up. Group B comprised 119 patients (58 females, 61 males) averaging 57 years of age (range, 20-80 years) who received, both, PR and wb-MRI. Two experienced radiologists were blinded regarding the disease status and assessed the number and location of osteolyses in consensus. A distinction was made between axial and extra-axial lesions. RESULTS: In group A, wb-CT revealed osteolyses in 12 patients (23%) that were not detected in PR. CT was superior in detecting lesions in patients with osteopenia and osteoporosis. Compared with PR, wb-CT was significantly more sensitive in detecting osteolyses than PR (p&lt;0.001). This was particularly true for axial lesions. Additionally, CT revealed clinically relevant incidental findings in 33 patients (63%). In group B, wb-MRI revealed lesions in 19 patients (16%) that were not detected in PR. All lesions detected by PR were also detected by wb-MRI and wb-CT. Wb-MRI and wb-CT are each superior to PR in detecting axial lesions. CONCLUSION: Wb-CT can detect 23% more focal lesions than PR, especially in the axial skeleton. Therefore, this imaging method should be preferred over PR in the diagnostic work-up and staging of patients with monoclonal plasma cell disease.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>83 (7), 1222-1230</Feld596><PubVol>83</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>1222</StrtPage><EndPage>1230</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Wolf MB" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Murray F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kilk K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Hillengass J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Delorme S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Heiss C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Neben K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Goldschmidt H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Kauczor HU" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Weber MA" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24793843</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.ejard.2014.02.008</DOI><KST>E010</KST><KST>C060</KST><KEYWORD>CONVENTIONAL RADIOGRAPHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MYELOMA WORKING GROUP</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BONE-MARROW INFILTRATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CLINICAL STAGING SYSTEM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENHANCEMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MULTIPLE-MYELOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIAGNOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>tomography</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51965</publishedID><Artikel>Tea and coffee consumption and risk of esophageal cancer: The European prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition study</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Epidemiological data regarding tea and coffee consumption and risk of esophageal cancer (EC) is still inconclusive. We examined the association of tea and coffee consumption with EC risk among 442,143 men and women without cancer at baseline from 9 countries of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition. Tea and coffee intakes were recorded using country-specific validated dietary questionnaires. Cox regression models were used to analyze the relationships between tea and coffee intake and EC risk. During a mean follow-up of 11.1 years, 339 participants developed EC, of which 142 were esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and 174 were esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). In the multivariable models, no significant associations between tea (mostly black tea), and coffee intake and risk of EC, EAC and ESCC were observed. In stratified analyses, among men coffee consumption was inversely related to ESCC (HR for comparison of extreme tertiles 0.42, 95% CI 0.20-0.88; p-trend = 0.022), but not among women. In current smokers, a significant and inverse association was observed between ESCC risk and tea (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.23-0.93; p-trend = 0.053) and coffee consumption (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.19-0.73; p-trend = 0.011). However, no statistically significant findings were observed using the continuous variable (per 100 mL/d). These data did not show a significant association between tea and coffee consumption and EC, EAC and ESCC, although a decreased risk of ESCC among men and current smokers is suggested, but need to be confirmed in further prospective studies including more cases.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>135 (6), 1470-1479</Feld596><PubVol>135</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>1470</StrtPage><EndPage>1479</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Zamora-Ros R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Lujan-Barroso L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Dik VK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Steffen A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Olsen A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Bech BH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Boutron-Ruault MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Racine A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Fagherazzi G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Kuhn T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="14" name="Katzke V" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Lagiou P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Trichopoulos D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Panico S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Vineis P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Grioni S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Palli D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Skeie G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Huerta JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Sanchez MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Arguelles M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Amiano P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Ardanaz E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Nilsson L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Wallner B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Lindkvist B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Wallstrom P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Peeters PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Key TJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Wareham NJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Freisling H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Stepien M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Ferrari P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Gunter MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Murphy N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="44" name="Gonzalez CA" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24535727</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28789</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>GREEN TEA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POLYPHENOLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COHORT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GASTRIC CARDIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METAANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALCOHOL-DRINKING</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>China</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADENOCARCINOMA RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRACT CANCER</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>51966</publishedID><Artikel>Angiopoietin 2 regulates the transformation and integrity of lymphatic endothelial cell junctions</Artikel><Journal>Genes and Development</Journal><ABSTr>Primitive lymphatic vessels are remodeled into functionally specialized initial and collecting lymphatics during development. Lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) junctions in initial lymphatics transform from a zipper-like to a button-like pattern during collecting vessel development, but what regulates this process is largely unknown. Angiopoietin 2 (Ang2) deficiency leads to abnormal lymphatic vessels. Here we found that an ANG2-blocking antibody inhibited embryonic lymphangiogenesis, whereas endothelium-specific ANG2 overexpression induced lymphatic hyperplasia. ANG2 inhibition blocked VE-cadherin phosphorylation at tyrosine residue 685 and the concomitant formation of button-like junctions in initial lymphatics. The defective junctions were associated with impaired lymph uptake. In collecting lymphatics, adherens junctions were disrupted, and the vessels leaked upon ANG2 blockade or gene deletion. ANG2 inhibition also suppressed the onset of lymphatic valve formation and subsequent valve maturation. These data identify ANG2 as the first essential regulator of the functionally important interendothelial cell-cell junctions that form during lymphatic development.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>28 (14), 1592-1603</Feld596><PubVol>28</PubVol><PubIss>14</PubIss><StrtPage>1592</StrtPage><EndPage>1603</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Zheng,W."

During mitogenic stimulation of primary lymphocytes, MYC promotes an increase in the expression of virtually all genes. In contrast, MYC-driven tumour cells differ from normal cells in the expression of specific sets of up- and downregulated genes that have considerable prognostic value. To understand this discrepancy, we studied the consequences of inducible expression and depletion of MYC in human cells and murine tumour models. Changes in MYC levels activate and repress specific sets of direct target genes that are characteristic of MYC-transformed tumour cells. Three factors account for this specificity. First, the magnitude of response parallels the change in occupancy by MYC at each promoter. Functionally distinct classes of target genes differ in the E-box sequence bound by MYC, suggesting that different cellular responses to physiological and oncogenic MYC levels are controlled by promoter affinity. Second, MYC both positively and negatively affects transcription initiation independent of its effect on transcriptional elongation. Third, complex formation with MIZ1 (also known as ZBTB17) mediates repression of multiple target genes by MYC and the ratio of MYC and MIZ1 bound to each promoter correlates with the direction of response.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>511 (7510), 483-487</Feld596><PubVol>511</PubVol><PubIss>7510</PubIss><StrtPage>483</StrtPage><EndPage>487</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Walz S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Lorenzin F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Morton J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Wiese KE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="von Eyss B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Herold S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Rycak L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Dumay-Odelot H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Karim S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Bartkuhn M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Roels F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Wustefeld T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Fischer M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Teichmann M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Zender L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Wei CL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Sansom O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Wolf E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Eilers M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25043018</PMID><DOI>10.1038/nature13473</DOI><KST>L801</KST><KEYWORD>C-MYC</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AMPLIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BINDING</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>transcription</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EMBRYONIC STEM-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CAD PROMOTER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RNA GENES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MIZ-1</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52009</publishedID><Artikel>A meta-analysis of 87,040 individuals identifies 23 new susceptibility loci for prostate cancer</Artikel><Journal>Nature Genetics</Journal><ABSTr>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 76 variants associated with prostate cancer risk predominantly in populations of European ancestry. To identify additional susceptibility loci for this common cancer, we conducted a meta-analysis of &gt;10 million SNPs in 43,303 prostate cancer cases and 43,737 controls from studies in populations of European, African, Japanese and Latino ancestry. Twenty-three new susceptibility loci were identified at association P &lt; 5 x 10(-8); 15 variants were identified among men of European ancestry, 7 were identified in multi-ancestry analyses and 1 was associated with early-onset prostate cancer. These 23 variants, in combination with known prostate cancer risk variants, explain 33% of the familial risk for this disease in European-ancestry populations. These findings provide new regions for investigation into the pathogenesis of prostate cancer and demonstrate the usefulness of combining ancestrally diverse populations to discover risk loci for disease.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>46 (10), 1103-1109</Feld596><PubVol>46</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>1103</StrtPage><EndPage>1109</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Al Olama,A.A."

Other WM and gray matter regions had much weaker or non-existent associations with longitudinal tissue change. Tissue loss in fSROI was in turn a significant factor in a survival model of cognitive decline, as was baseline fornix microstructure. These findings suggest that WM deterioration in the fornix and tissue loss in fSROI may be the early beginnings of posterior limbic circuit and default mode network degeneration. We also found that gray matter baseline volumes in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus predicted cognitive decline in survival models. But since GM regions did not also significantly predict brain-tissue loss, our results may imply a view in which early, prodromal deterioration appears as two quasi independent processes in white and gray matter regions of the limbic circuit crucial to memory.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>6 (), Art.

Methods commonly used to date for pathogen detection are neither cost-effective nor time- and animal-efficient or uniform. However, an infection even if silent alters experimental results through changing the animals' physiology and increases inter-individual variability. As a consequence higher numbers of animals and experiments are needed for valid and significant results. We developed a novel high-throughput multiplex assay, called rodent DNA virus finder (rDVF) for the simultaneous identification of 24 DNA viruses infecting mice and rats. We detected all 24 DNA viruses with high specificity and reproducibility. Detection limits for the different DNA viruses varied between 10 and 1000 copies per PCR. The validation of rDVF was done with DNA isolated from homogenised organs amplified by pathogen specific primers in one multiplex PCR. The biotinylated amplicons were detected via hybridisation to specific oligonucleotide probes coupled to spectrally distinct sets of fluorescent Luminex beads. In conclusion, rDVF may have the potential to replace conventional testing and may simplify and improve routine detection of DNA viruses infecting rodents.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (5), e97525-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>e97525</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Hoefler D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Nicklas W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Mauter P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Pawlita M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schmitt M" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24835244</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0097525</DOI><KST>F020</KST><KST>W440</KST><KEYWORD>ANTIBODY-PRODUCTION TEST</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BIOLOGICAL-MATERIALS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RAT COLONIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONTAMINATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MINUTE VIRUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POLYMERASE-CHAIN-REACTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PCR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOUSE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52035</publishedID><Artikel>Renal lipidosis in patients enrolled in a methadone substitution program</Artikel><Journal>Archives of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine</Journal><ABSTr>Kidney biopsies often show accumulation of lipids or lipidlike material.

In this study we describe a renal lipidosis occurring in patients with a positive history of narcotic abuse who were enrolled in a methadone substitution program. All 3 patients presented with proteinuria (2.5-20 g/d) and impaired renal function. Renal biopsy revealed a pronounced extracellular and intracellular deposition of lipidlike material in the glomerular, interstitial, and tubular compartments.

In rodents, the SVZ is a lifelong source of new neurons fated to migrate to the olfactory bulb (OB), where the majority become GABAergic interneurons. The plastic capacity of neonatal and adult SVZ stem/progenitor cells is still largely unknown. By overexpressing the transcription factor Fezf2, a powerful master gene specifying the phenotype of glutamatergic subcerebral projecting neurons, we investigated whether the fate of postnatally generated SVZ neurons can be altered. Following lentiviral delivery of Fezf2 in the neonatal and adult SVZ niche, we showed that ectopic Fezf2 expression is sufficient to redirect the fate of SVZ stem cells. Thus, based on in vivo and in vitro experiments, we provide evidence that numerous Fezf2-positive OB neurons expressed glutamatergic pyramidal cell molecular markers instead of developing a GABAergic identity. Overexpression of Fezf2 had no effect on transit-amplifying progenitors or neuroblasts but was restricted to neural stem cells. Fezf2-respecified neurons bore features of pyramidal cells, exhibiting a larger cell body and a more elaborate dendritic tree, compared with OB granule cells. Patch-clamp recordings further indicated that Fezf2-respecified neurons had synaptic properties and a firing pattern reminiscent of a pyramidal cell-like phenotype. Together, the results demonstrate that neonatal and adult SVZ stem cells retain neuronal fate plasticity.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>111 (29), 10726-10731</Feld596><PubVol>111</PubVol><PubIss>29</PubIss><StrtPage>10726</StrtPage><EndPage>10731</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Zuccotti A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Le Magueresse C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Chen M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Neitz A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Monyer H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25002477</PMID><DOI>10.1073/pnas.1320290111</DOI><KST>A230</KST><KEYWORD>OLFACTORY-BULB NEUROGENESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CORTICOFUGAL NEURONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGENITORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CEREBRAL-CORTEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>adult neurogenesis</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LAYER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SPECIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>brain</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52037</publishedID><Artikel>Dosimetric effects of swelling or shrinking tissue during helical tomotherapy breast irradiation. A phantom study</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Applied Clinical Medical Physics</Journal><ABSTr>During radiation therapy of the female breast, the actual target volume compared to the planning target volume may change due to swelling or shrinking of the tissue. Under-or overdosage is to be expected, especially when performing IMRT or tomotherapy techniques. The objective of this study is to develop a model-based quantification of these dose effects, with a particular focus on the changes in the surface dose. A cylindrical phantom was used as an artificial surrogate of the human torso. By adding and removing Superflab layers of various thicknesses, both radial breast swelling and shrinking could be simulated. The effects on dose distribution were evaluated using film dosimetry. The results were compared to dose calculations. To estimate the true surface doses, we subtracted the influence of the film material on air measurements. During a swelling of 5, 10, and 15 mm, the planning target volume was consistently underdosed by 2%, 5%, and 7% of the prescribed dose, respectively. Swelling led to reduced dose values of up to 72%, 55%, and 50% at the outer edge of the actual target volume. The measured surface dose decreased successively from 31% to 23%. During shrinking, the dose in the planning target volume increased successively from 100% to 106%. The measured surface doses increased from 29% to 36%. The calculated dose values agreed with the measured values within error limits. During radiotherapy of the female breast, new planning appears to be essential for radial tissue swelling of 5 mm or more because of severe underdosing. Shrinking leads to moderate overdosing and an increased surface dose. In addition, caution is advised when removing bolus material with respect to the planned situation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>15 (4), 382-391</Feld596><PubVol>15</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>382</StrtPage><EndPage>391</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Klepper,R."

Genomics has illuminated the extensive intertumoral heterogeneity of medulloblastoma, identifying four distinct molecular subgroups. Group 3 and group 4 subgroup medulloblastomas account for most paediatric cases; yet, oncogenic drivers for these subtypes remain largely unidentified. Here we describe a series of prevalent, highly disparate genomic structural variants, restricted to groups 3 and 4, resulting in specific and mutually exclusive activation of the growth factor independent 1 family proto-oncogenes, GFI1 and GFI1B. Somatic structural variants juxtapose GFI1 or GFI1B coding sequences proximal to active enhancer elements, including super-enhancers, instigating oncogenic activity. Our results, supported by evidence from mouse models, identify GFI1 and GFI1B as prominent medulloblastoma oncogenes and implicate 'enhancer hijacking' as an efficient mechanism driving oncogene activation in a childhood cancer.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>511 (7510), 428-434</Feld596><PubVol>511</PubVol><PubIss>7510</PubIss><StrtPage>428</StrtPage><EndPage>434</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Northcott,P.A.*" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Lee,C.*" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Zichner,T.*" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Stutz,A.M."

However, tamoxifen resistance is frequently observed under therapy. A tamoxifen resistant cell line has been generated from the estrogen receptor positive mamma carcinoma cell line MCF-7 and was analyzed for putative differences in the aldehyde defence system and accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGE). In comparison to wt MCF-7 cells, these tamoxifen resistant cells were more sensitive to the dicarbonyl compounds glyoxal and methylglyoxal and displayed increased caspase activity, p38-MAPK- and I kappa B alpha-phosphorylation. However, mRNA accumulation of the aldehyde-and AGE-defence enzymes glyoxalase-1 and -2 (GLO1, GLO2) as well as fructosamine-3-kinase (FN3K) was not significantly altered. Tamoxifen resistant cells contained less free sulfhydryl-groups (glutathione) suggesting that the increased sensitivity towards the dicarbonyls was due to a higher sensitivity towards reactive oxygen species which are associated with dicarbonyl stress. To further analyse, if these data are of more general importance, key experiments were replicated with tamoxifen resistant MCF-7 cell lines from two independent sources. These cell lines were also more sensitive to aldehydes, especially glyoxal, but were different in their cellular signalling responses to the aldehydes. In conclusion, glyoxalases and other aldehyde defence enzymes might represent a promising target for the therapy of tamoxifen resistant breast cancers.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (7), e101473-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>e101473</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Nass,N."

Recent experiments revealed several conflicting trends of the NRL dependence on the concentrations of histones and other architectural chromatin proteins, both in vitro and in vivo, but a systematic theoretical description of NRL as a function of DNA sequence and epigenetic determinants is currently lacking. To address this problem, we have performed an integrative biophysical and bioinformatics analysis in species ranging from yeast to frog to mouse where NRL was studied as a function of various parameters. We show that in simple eukaryotes such as yeast, a lower limit for the NRL value exists, determined by internucleosome interactions and remodeler action. For higher eukaryotes, also the upper limit exists since NRL is an increasing but saturating function of the linker histone concentration. Counterintuitively, smaller H1 variants or non-histone architectural proteins can initiate larger effects on the NRL due to entropic reasons. Furthermore, we demonstrate that different regimes of the NRL dependence on histone concentrations exist depending on whether DNA sequence-specific effects dominate over boundary effects or vice versa. We consider several classes of genomic regions with apparently different regimes of the NRL variation. As one extreme, our analysis reveals that the period of oscillations of the nucleosome density around bound RNA polymerase coincides with the period of oscillations of positioning sites of the corresponding DNA sequence. At another extreme, we show that although mouse major satellite repeats intrinsically encode well-defined nucleosome preferences, they have no unique nucleosome arrangement and can undergo a switch between two distinct types of nucleosome positioning.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>10 (7), e1003698-</Feld596><PubVol>10</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>e1003698</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Beshnova DA" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Cherstvy AG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Vainshtein Y" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Teif VB" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24992723</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003698</DOI><KST>B066</KST><KEYWORD>BINDING</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>transcription</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ORGANIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LARGE LIGANDS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EUKARYOTIC GENOME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-REGULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHROMATIN-STRUCTURE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LINKER HISTONE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHASE-TRANSITION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52153</publishedID><Artikel>The 14-3-3 protein Bmh1 functions in the spindle position checkpoint by breaking Bfa1 asymmetry at yeast centrosomes</Artikel><Journal>Molecular Biology of the Cell</Journal><ABSTr>In addition to their well-known role in microtubule organization, centrosomes function as signaling platforms and regulate cell cycle events. An important example of such a function is the spindle position checkpoint (SPOC) of budding yeast. SPOC is a surveillance mechanism that ensures alignment of the mitotic spindle along the cell polarity axis. Upon spindle misalignment, phosphorylation of the SPOC component Bfa1 by Kin4 kinase engages the SPOC by changing the centrosome localization of Bfa1 from asymmetric (one centrosome) to symmetric (both centrosomes). Here we show that, unexpectedly, Kin4 alone is unable to break Bfa1 asymmetry at yeast centrosomes. Instead, phosphorylation of Bfa1 by Kin4 creates a docking site on Bfa1 for the 14-3-3 family protein Bmh1, which in turn weakens Bfa1-centrosome association and promotes symmetric Bfa1 localization. Consistently, BMH1-null cells are SPOC deficient. Our work thus identifies Bmh1 as a new SPOC component and refines the molecular mechanism that breaks Bfa1 centrosome asymmetry upon SPOC activation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>25 (14), 2143-2151</Feld596><PubVol>25</PubVol><PubIss>14</PubIss><StrtPage>2143</StrtPage><EndPage>2151</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Caydasi AK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Micoogullari Y" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kurtulmus B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Palani S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Pereira G" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24850890</PMID><DOI>10.1091/mbc.E14-04-0890</DOI><KST>A180</KST><KEYWORD>MITOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>KINASE KIN4</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VITRO REGULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MITOTIC EXIT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANAPHASE SPINDLE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA-DAMAGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BUDDING YEAST</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BINDING</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52154</publishedID><Artikel>Large-scale evaluation of common variation in regulatory T cell-related genes and ovarian cancer outcome</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Immunology Research</Journal><ABSTr>The presence of regulatory T cells (Treg) in solid tumors is known to play a role in patient survival in ovarian cancer and other malignancies. We assessed inherited genetic variations via 749 tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in 25 Treg-associated genes (CD28, CTLA4, FOXP3, IDO1, IL10, IL10RA, IL15, 1L17RA, IL23A, IL23R, IL2RA, IL6, IL6R, IL8, LGALS1, LGALS9, MAP3K8, STAT5A, STAT5B, TGFB1, TGFB2, TGFB3, TGFBR1, TGRBR2, and TGFBR3) in relation to ovarian cancer survival. We analyzed genotype and overall survival in 10,084 women with invasive epithelial ovarian cancer, including 5,248 high-grade serous, 1,452 endometrioid, 795 clear cell, and 661 mucinous carcinoma cases of European descent across 28 studies from the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC). The strongest associations were found for endometrioid carcinoma and IL2RA SNPs rs11256497 [HR, 1.42; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.22-1.64; P = 5.7 x 10(-6)], rs791587 (HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.17-1.57; P = 6.2 x 10(-5)), rs2476491 (HR, = 1.40; 95% CI, 1.19-1.64; P = 5.6 x 10(-5)), and rs10795763 (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.17-1.57; P = 7.9 x 10(-5)), and for clear cell carcinoma and CTLA4 SNP rs231775 (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.54-0.82; P = 9.3 x 10(-5)) after adjustment for age, study site, population stratification, stage, grade, and oral contraceptive use. The rs231775 allele associated with improved survival in our study also results in an amino acid change in CTLA4 and previously has been reported to be associated with autoimmune conditions. Thus, we found evidence that SNPs in genes related to Tregs seem to play a role in ovarian cancer survival, particularly in patients with clear cell and endometrioid epithelial ovarian cancer.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>2 (4), 332-340</Feld596><PubVol>2</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>332</StrtPage><EndPage>340</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Charbonneau B"

a web server for the in silico prediction of rodent oral toxicity</Artikel><Journal>Nucleic Acids Research</Journal><ABSTr>Animal trials are currently the major method for determining the possible toxic effects of drug candidates and cosmetics. In silico prediction methods represent an alternative approach and aim to rationalize the preclinical drug development, thus enabling the reduction of the associated time, costs and animal experiments. Here, we present ProTox, a web server for the prediction of rodent oral toxicity. The prediction method is based on the analysis of the similarity of compounds with known median lethal doses (LD50) and incorporates the identification of toxic fragments, therefore representing a novel approach in toxicity prediction. In addition, the web server includes an indication of possible toxicity targets which is based on an in-house collection of protein-ligand-based pharmacophore models ('toxicophores') for targets associated with adverse drug reactions. The ProTox web server is open to all users and can be accessed without registration at: http://tox.charite.de/tox. The only requirement for the prediction is the two-dimensional structure of the input compounds. All ProTox methods have been evaluated based on a diverse external validation set and displayed strong performance (sensitivity, specificity and precision of 76, 95 and 75%, respectively) and superiority over other toxicity prediction tools, indicating their possible applicability for other compound classes.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>42 (Web Server issue), W53-W58</Feld596><PubVol>42</PubVol><PubIss>Web Server issue</PubIss><StrtPage>W53</StrtPage><EndPage>W58</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Drwal MN" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Banerjee P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Dunkel M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Wettig MR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Preissner R" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24838562</PMID><DOI>10.1093/nar/gku401</DOI><KST>L201</KST><KEYWORD>pharmacology</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHEMISTRY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SETS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FRAGMENTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DRUG</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMPREHENSIVE DATABASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUPERTARGET</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52156</publishedID><Artikel>Lifetime alcohol use and overall and cause-specific mortality in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC) study</Artikel><Journal>BMJ open</Journal><ABSTr>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the role of factors that modulate the association between alcohol and mortality, and to provide estimates of absolute risk of death. DESIGN: The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC). SETTING: 23 centres in 10 countries. PARTICIPANTS: 380 395 men and women, free of cancer, diabetes, heart attack or stroke at enrolment, followed up for 12.6 years on average. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 20 453 fatal events, of which 2053 alcohol-related cancers (ARC, including cancers of upper aerodigestive tract, liver, colorectal and female breast), 4187 cardiovascular diseases/coronary heart disease (CVD/CHD), 856 violent deaths and injuries. Lifetime alcohol use was assessed at recruitment. RESULTS: HRs comparing extreme drinkers (&gt;/=30 g/day in women and &gt;/=60 g/day in men) to moderate drinkers (0.1-4.9 g/day) were 1.27 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.43) in women and 1.53 (1.39 to 1.68) in men. Strong associations were observed for ARC mortality, in men particularly, and for violent deaths and injuries, in men only. No associations were observed for CVD/CHD mortality among drinkers, whereby HRs were higher in never compared to moderate drinkers. Overall mortality seemed to be more strongly related to beer than wine use, particularly in men. The 10-year risks of overall death for women aged 60 years, drinking more than 30 g/day was 5% and 7%, for never and current smokers, respectively. Corresponding figures in men consuming more than 60 g/day were 11% and 18%, in never and current smokers, respectively. In competing risks analyses, mortality due to CVD/CHD was more pronounced than ARC in men, while CVD/CHD and ARC mortality were of similar magnitude in women. CONCLUSIONS: In this large European cohort, alcohol use was positively associated with overall mortality, ARC and violent death and injuries, but marginally to CVD/CHD. Absolute risks of death observed in EPIC suggest that alcohol is an important determinant of total mortality.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>4 (7), e005245-</Feld596><PubVol>4</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>e005245</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Ferrari P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Licaj I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Muller DC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kragh Andersen P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Johansson M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Dossus L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Dartois L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Fagherazzi G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Bradbury KE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Wareham N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Duell EJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Barricarte A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Molina-Montes E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Sanchez CN" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Arriola L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Wallstrom P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Olsen A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Benetou V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Trichopoulos D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Agnoli C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Sacerdote C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Palli D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Li K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="29" name="Kaaks R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="30" name="Peeters P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Beulens JW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Nunes L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Gunter M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Norat T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Brennan P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Romieu I" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24993766</PMID><DOI>10.1136/bmjopen-2014-005245</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>RATE ADVANCEMENT PERIODS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPIDEMIOLOGY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MODELS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONSUMPTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLOBAL BURDEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMPETING RISKS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>fractional polynomials</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADULTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METAANALYSIS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52157</publishedID><Artikel>L1CAM promotes enrichment of immunosuppressive T cells in human pancreatic cancer correlating with malignant progression</Artikel><Journal>Molecular Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>Regulatory T cell (T-reg) enrichment in the tumor microenvironment is regarded as an important mechanism of tumor immune escape. Hence, the presence of T-regs in highly malignant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is correlated with short survival. Likewise, the adhesion molecule L1CAM is upregulated during PDAC progression in the pancreatic ductal epithelium also being associated with poor prognosis. To investigate whether L1CAM contributes to enrichment of T-regs in PDAC, human CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(-)CD49d(-) T-regs and CD4(+)CD25(-) T-effector cells (T-effs) were isolated by magnetic bead separation from blood of healthy donors. Their phenotype and functional behavior were analyzed in dependence on human premalignant (H6c7) or malignant (Panc1) pancreatic ductal epithelial cells, either exhibiting or lacking L1CAM expression. T cells derived from blood and tumors of PDAC patients were analyzed by flow cytometry and findings were correlated with clinical parameters. Predominantly T-regs but not T-effs showed an increased migration on L1CAM expressing H6c7 and Panc1 cells. Whereas proliferation of T-regs did not change in the presence of L1CAM, T-effs proliferated less, exhibited a decreased CD25 expression and an increased expression of CD69. Moreover, these T-effs exhibited a regulatory phenotype as they inhibited proliferation of autologous T cells. Accordingly, CD4(+)CD25(-)CD69(+) T cells were highly abundant in PDAC tissues compared to blood being associated with nodal invasion and higher grading in PDAC patients. Overall, these data point to an important role of L1CAM in the enrichment of immunosuppressive T cells in particular of a CD4(+)CD25(-)CD69(+)-phenotype in PDAC providing a novel mechanism of tumor immune escape which contributes to tumor progression.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>8 (5), 982-997</Feld596><PubVol>8</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>982</StrtPage><EndPage>997</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Grage-Griebenow E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Jerg E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Gorys A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Wicklein D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Wesch D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Freitag-Wolf S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Goebel L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Vogel I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Becker T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Ebsen M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Rocken C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Altevogt P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Schumacher U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Schaefer H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Sebens S" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24746181</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.molonc.2014.03.001</DOI><KST>D015</KST><KEYWORD>MURINE MODEL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MYOFIBROBLASTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OVARIAN-CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PERIPHERAL-BLOOD</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PREVALENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>microenvironment</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>adenocarcinoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LESIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52158</publishedID><Artikel>The conformational state of the nucleosome entry-exit site modulates TATA box-specific TBP binding</Artikel><Journal>Nucleic Acids Research</Journal><ABSTr>The TATA binding protein (TBP) is a critical transcription factor used for nucleating assembly of the RNA polymerase II machinery. TBP binds TATA box elements with high affinity and kinetic stability and in vivo is correlated with high levels of transcription activation. However, since most promoters use less stable TATA-less or TATA-like elements, while also competing with nucleosome occupancy, further mechanistic insight into TBP's DNA binding properties and ability to access chromatin is needed. Using bulk and single-molecule FRET, we find that TBP binds a minimal consensus TATA box as a two-state equilibrium process, showing no evidence for intermediate states. However, upon addition of flanking DNA sequence, we observe non-specific cooperative binding to multiple DNA sites that compete for TATA-box specificity. Thus, we conclude that TBP binding is defined by a branched pathway, wherein TBP initially binds with little sequence specificity and is thermodynamically positioned by its kinetic stability to the TATA box. Furthermore, we observed the real-time access of TBP binding to TATA box DNA located within the DNA entry-exit site of the nucleosome. From these data, we determined salt-dependent changes in the nucleosome conformation regulate TBP's access to the TATA box, where access is highly constrained under physiological conditions, but is alleviated by histone acetylation and TFIIA.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>42 (12), 7561-7576</Feld596><PubVol>42</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>7561</StrtPage><EndPage>7576</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hieb AR" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Gansen A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Boehm V" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Langowski J" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24829456</PMID><DOI>10.1093/nar/gku423</DOI><KST>B040</KST><KEYWORD>COMPLEXES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>transcription</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECOGNITION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA TARGET SITES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HISTONE TAILS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SPONTANEOUS ACCESS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RESONANCE ENERGY-TRANSFER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEIN TBP</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>2-STEP MECHANISM</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52159</publishedID><Artikel>Separating fusion from rivalry</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>Visual fusion is the process in which differing but compatible binocular information is transformed into a unified percept. Even though this is at the basis of binocular vision, the underlying neural processes are, as yet, poorly understood. In our study we therefore aimed to investigate neural correlates of visual fusion. To this end, we presented binocularly compatible, fusible (BF), and incompatible, rivaling (BR) stimuli, as well as an intermediate stimulus type containing both binocularly fusible and monocular, incompatible elements (BFR). Comparing BFR stimuli with BF and BR stimuli, respectively, we were able to disentangle brain responses associated with either visual fusion or rivalry. By means of functional magnetic resonance imaging, we measured brain responses to these stimulus classes in the visual cortex, and investigated them in detail at various retinal eccentricities. Compared with BF stimuli, the response to BFR stimuli was elevated in visual cortical areas V1 and V2, but not in V3 and V4 - implying that the response to monocular stimulus features decreased from V1 to V4. Compared to BR stimuli, the response to BFR stimuli decreased with increasing eccentricity, specifically within V3 and V4. Taken together, it seems that although the processing of exclusively monocular information decreases from V1 to V4, the processing of binocularly fused information increases from earlier to later visual areas. Our findings suggest the presence of an inhibitory neural mechanism which, depending on the presence of fusion, acts differently on the processing of monocular information.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (7), e103037-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>e103037</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Kallenberger SM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Schmidt C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Dechent P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Forster C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="von Steinbuechel N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Wuestenberg T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Strasburger H" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25054904</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0103037</DOI><KST>B080</KST><KEYWORD>LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN SUPERIOR COLLICULUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MONKEY VISUAL-CORTEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BINOCULAR-RIVALRY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PERIPHERAL-VISION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEURONAL-ACTIVITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STRIATE CORTEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Attention</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONTRAST</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52160</publishedID><Artikel>Evolution of repeat prostate biopsy strategies incorporating transperineal and MRI-TRUS fusion techniques</Artikel><Journal>World Journal of Urology</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that MRI-TRUS fusion technique can increase the detection rate of prostate cancer (PC) in patients with previously negative biopsy. METHODS: Patient records of men with persisting suspicion for PC after previous negative biopsy having undergone either extensive transrectal prostate biopsies (MD Anderson protocol; MDA), transperineal saturation (STP) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) fusion transperineal biopsies (MTTP) in three consecutive time intervals were reviewed retrospectively. The respective approach was the standard for the above indication at these episodes. In Cambridge, 70 patients underwent MDA biopsies, 75 STP underwent biopsies and 74 patients underwent MTTP biopsies. In total, 164 MTTP patients with the same indication from Heidelberg were analysed as reference standard. In total, 383 men were included into analysis. Low-grade PC was defined as Gleason score 7 (3 + 4) or lower. RESULTS: Even though MTTP patients had significantly larger prostates, the overall cancer detection rate for PC was the highest in MTTP (24.2 % MDA, 41.3 % STP, 44.5 % MTTP, p = 0.027, Kruskal-Wallis test). The detection rate for clinically relevant high-grade PC was highest in MTTP; however, this did not reach statistical significance compared with MDA (23.5 % MDA, 12.9 % STP, 27.2 % MTTP, p = 0.25, Fischer's exact test). Comparing MTTP between Cambridge and Heidelberg, detection rates did not differ significantly (44.5 vs. 48 %, p = 0.58). There was a higher detection rate of high-grade cancer in Heidelberg. (36.3 vs. 27.2 %, p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Patients whom are considered for repeat biopsies may benefit from undergoing MRI-targeted TRUS fusion technique due to higher cancer detection rate of significant PC.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>32 (4), 945-950</Feld596><PubVol>32</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>945</StrtPage><EndPage>950</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kuru TH" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Saeb-Parsy K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Cantiani A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Frey J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Lombardo R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Serrao E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Gaziev G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Koo B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Roethke M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Gnanapragasam V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Warren A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Doble A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Hadaschik B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Kastner C" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24917295</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00345-014-1334-1</DOI><KST>E010</KST><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMPLICATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPERIENCE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52161</publishedID><Artikel>Transgenic expression of human glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor from integration-deficient lentiviral vectors is neuroprotective in a rodent model of Parkinson's disease</Artikel><Journal>Human Gene Therapy</Journal><ABSTr>Standard integration-proficient lentiviral vectors (IPLVs) are effective at much lower doses than other vector systems and have shown promise for gene therapy of Parkinson's disease (PD). Their main drawback is the risk of insertional mutagenesis. The novel biosafety-enhanced integration-deficient lentiviral vectors (IDLVs) may offer a significant enhancement in biosafety, but have not been previously tested in a model of a major disease. We have assessed biosafety and transduction efficiency of IDLVs in a rat model of PD, using IPLVs as a reference. Genomic insertion of lentivectors injected into the lesioned striatum was studied by linear amplification-mediated polymerase chain reaction (PCR), followed by deep sequencing and insertion site analysis, demonstrating lack of significant IDLV integration. Reporter gene expression studies showed efficient, long-lived, and transcriptionally targeted expression from IDLVs injected ahead of lesioning in the rat striatum, although at somewhat lower expression levels than from IPLVs. Transgenic human glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (hGDNF) expression from IDLVs was used for a long-term investigation of lentivector-mediated, transcriptionally targeted neuroprotection in this PD rat model. Vectors were injected before striatal lesioning, and the results showed improvements in nigral dopaminergic neuron survival and behavioral tests regardless of lentiviral integration proficiency, although they confirmed lower expression levels of hGDNF from IDLVs. These data demonstrate the effectiveness of IDLVs in a model of a major disease and indicate that these vectors could provide long-term PD treatment at low dose, combining efficacy and biosafety for targeted central nervous system applications.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>25 (7), 631-641</Feld596><PubVol>25</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>631</StrtPage><EndPage>641</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Lu-Nguyen NB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Broadstock M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Schliesser MG" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Bartholomae CC" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="von Kalle C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Schmidt M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Yanez-Munoz RJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24635742</PMID><DOI>10.1089/hum.2014.003</DOI><KST>G100</KST><KEYWORD>GENE-THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DELIVERY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CLINICAL-TRIAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONTROLLED-TRIAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NIGROSTRIATAL SYSTEM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADENOASSOCIATED VIRAL VECTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>6-OHDA LESION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GDNF</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52162</publishedID><Artikel>SuperPred: update on drug classification and target prediction</Artikel><Journal>Nucleic Acids Research</Journal><ABSTr>The SuperPred web server connects chemical similarity of drug-like compounds with molecular targets and the therapeutic approach based on the similar property principle. Since the first release of this server, the number of known compound-target interactions has increased from 7000 to 665,000, which allows not only a better prediction quality but also the estimation of a confidence. Apart from the addition of quantitative binding data and the statistical consideration of the similarity distribution in all drug classes, new approaches were implemented to improve the target prediction. The 3D similarity as well as the occurrence of fragments and the concordance of physico-chemical properties is also taken into account. In addition, the effect of different fingerprints on the prediction was examined. The retrospective prediction of a drug class (ATC code of the WHO) allows the evaluation of methods and descriptors for a well-characterized set of approved drugs. The prediction is improved by 7.5% to a total accuracy of 75.1%. For query compounds with sufficient structural similarity, the web server allows prognoses about the medical indication area of novel compounds and to find new leads for known targets.

By conducting a genome-scale cDNA overexpression screen, we have identified the Rho GAP family member Arhgap36 as a positive regulator of the Hh pathway in vitro and in vivo. Arhgap36 acts in a Smoothened (Smo)-independent manner to inhibit Gli repressor formation and to promote the activation of full-length Gli proteins. Arhgap36 concurrently induces the accumulation of Gli proteins in the primary cilium, and its ability to induce Gli-dependent transcription requires kinesin family member 3a and intraflagellar transport protein 88, proteins that are essential for ciliogenesis. Arhgap36 also functionally and biochemically interacts with Suppressor of Fused. Transcriptional profiling further reveals that Arhgap36 is overexpressed in murine medulloblastomas that acquire resistance to chemical Smo inhibitors and that ARHGAP36 isoforms capable of Gli activation are up-regulated in a subset of human medulloblastomas. Our findings reveal a new mechanism of Gli transcription factor activation and implicate ARHGAP36 dysregulation in the onset and/or progression of GLI-dependent cancers.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>111 (30), 11061-11066</Feld596><PubVol>111</PubVol><PubIss>30</PubIss><StrtPage>11061</StrtPage><EndPage>11066</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Rack PG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Ni J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Payumo AY" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Nguyen V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Crapster JA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hovestadt V" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Kool M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Jones DT" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Mich JK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Firestone AJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Pfister SM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Cho YJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Chen JK" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25024229</PMID><DOI>10.1073/pnas.1322362111</DOI><KST>B060</KST><KST>B062</KST><KEYWORD>CEREBELLUM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SONIC HEDGEHOG</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MECHANISM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHWAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTRAFLAGELLAR TRANSPORT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GTPASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>medulloblastoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENETIC PROFILES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PRIMARY CILIUM</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52164</publishedID><Artikel>Sequence-resolved free energy profiles of stress-bearing vimentin intermediate filaments</Artikel><Journal>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</Journal><ABSTr>Intermediate filaments (IFs) are key to the mechanical strength of metazoan cells. Their basic building blocks are dimeric coiled coils mediating hierarchical assembly of the full-length filaments. Here we use single-molecule force spectroscopy by optical tweezers to assess the folding and stability of coil 2B of the model IF protein vimentin. The coiled coil was unzipped from its N and C termini. When pulling from the C terminus, we observed that the coiled coil was resistant to force owing to the high stability of the C-terminal region. Pulling from the N terminus revealed that the N-terminal half is considerably less stable. The mechanical pulling assay is a unique tool to study and control seed formation and structure propagation of the coiled coil. We then used rigorous theory-based deconvolution for a model-free extraction of the energy landscape and local stability profiles. The data obtained from the two distinct pulling directions complement each other and reveal a tripartite stability of the coiled coil: a labile N-terminal half, followed by a medium stability section and a highly stable region at the far C-terminal end. The different stability regions provide important insight into the mechanics of IF assembly.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>111 (31), 11359-11364</Feld596><PubVol>111</PubVol><PubIss>31</PubIss><StrtPage>11359</StrtPage><EndPage>11364</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ramm B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Stigler J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Hinczewski M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Thirumalai D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Herrmann H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Woehlke G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Rief M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25049381</PMID><DOI>10.1073/pnas.1403122111</DOI><KST>B065</KST><KEYWORD>OLIGOMERIZATION STATE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ROD DOMAIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOLECULAR ARCHITECTURE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STABILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ATOMIC-STRUCTURE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HELICAL COILED-COILS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISTINCT STAGES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SALT-BRIDGES</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52165</publishedID><Artikel>Bead-based multiplex sexually transmitted infection profiling</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Infection</Journal><ABSTr>OBJECTIVES: Sexually transmitted infections are a significant cause of genital disease, infertility and hospital admissions. The economic impact is high. An accurate diagnosis is often difficult and time consuming. We report the development and validation of a novel bead-based multiplex sexually transmitted infection profiling (STIP) assay that detects 18 sexually transmitted infections using a multiplex PCR followed by Luminex bead-based hybridisation. METHODS: STIP was validated using urogenital samples pretested by commercially available quantitative PCR, microscopy or by culturing methods. RESULTS: STIP specifically detects Chlamydia trachomatis, Herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, Treponema pallidum, Trichomonas vaginalis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Mycoplasma (M.) genitalium, M. hominis, M. pneumonia, M. spermatophilum, Ureaplasma urealyticum and U. parvum, and quantifies bacterial vaginosis-associated Atopobium vaginae and Gardnerella vaginalis as well as three Candida species and normal genital flora-associated Lactobacillus species. STIP reached an overall concordance of 95-100% with commercially available quantitative PCR tests. Compared to Nugent score, STIP reached a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 86% for bacterial vaginosis detection. Candida specimens, pretested by direct culturing, were identified with a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 99%. CONCLUSIONS: STIP is a powerful high-throughput tool in assessing a broad spectrum of urogenital infections.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>69 (2), 123-133</Feld596><PubVol>69</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>123</StrtPage><EndPage>133</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schmitt M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Depuydt C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Stalpaert M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Pawlita M" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24814157</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.jinf.2014.04.006</DOI><KST>F020</KST><KEYWORD>BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GARDNERELLA-VAGINALIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEISSERIA-GONORRHOEAE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MYCOPLASMA-HOMINIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REACTION ASSAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CERVICAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>real-time PCR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POLYMERASE-CHAIN-REACTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VIRAL LOAD</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>papillomaviruses</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52166</publishedID><Artikel>Nucleosome repositioning links DNA (de)methylation and differential CTCF binding during stem cell development</Artikel><Journal>Genome Research</Journal><ABSTr>During differentiation of embryonic stem cells, chromatin reorganizes to establish cell type-specific expression programs. Here, we have dissected the linkages between DNA methylation (5mC), hydroxymethylation (5hmC), nucleosome repositioning, and binding of the transcription factor CTCF during this process. By integrating MNase-seq and ChIP-seq experiments in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC) and their differentiated counterparts with biophysical modeling, we found that the interplay between these factors depends on their genomic context. The mostly unmethylated CpG islands have reduced nucleosome occupancy and are enriched in cell type-independent binding sites for CTCF. The few remaining methylated CpG dinucleotides are preferentially associated with nucleosomes. In contrast, outside of CpG islands most CpGs are methylated, and the average methylation density oscillates so that it is highest in the linker region between nucleosomes. Outside CpG islands, binding of TET1, an enzyme that converts 5mC to 5hmC, is associated with labile, MNase-sensitive nucleosomes. Such nucleosomes are poised for eviction in ESCs and become stably bound in differentiated cells where the TET1 and 5hmC levels go down. This process regulates a class of CTCF binding sites outside CpG islands that are occupied by CTCF in ESCs but lose the protein during differentiation. We rationalize this cell type-dependent targeting of CTCF with a quantitative biophysical model of competitive binding with the histone octamer, depending on the TET1, 5hmC, and 5mC state.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>24 (8), 1285-1295</Feld596><PubVol>24</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>1285</StrtPage><EndPage>1295</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Teif VB" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Beshnova DA" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Vainshtein Y" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Marth C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Mallm JP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hoefer T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Rippe K" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24812327</PMID><DOI>10.1101/gr.164418.113</DOI><KST>B066</KST><KST>B086</KST><KEYWORD>ISLANDS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR-BINDING</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHROMATIN ACCESSIBILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REVEALS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ARCHITECTURE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METHYLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MODEL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PLURIPOTENT CELLS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52167</publishedID><Artikel>MicroRNA-519a is a novel oncomir conferring tamoxifen resistance by targeting a network of tumour-suppressor genes in ER+ breast cancer</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Pathology</Journal><ABSTr>Tamoxifen is an endocrine therapy which is administered to up to 70% of all breast cancer patients with oestrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) expression. Despite the initial response, most patients eventually acquire resistance to the drug. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs which have the ability to post-transcriptionally regulate genes. Although the role of a few miRNAs has been described in tamoxifen resistance at the single gene/target level, little is known about how concerted actions of miRNAs targeting biological networks contribute to resistance. Here we identified the miRNA cluster, C19MC, which harbours around 50 mature miRNAs, to be up-regulated in resistant cells, with miRNA-519a being the most highly up-regulated. We could demonstrate that miRNA-519a regulates tamoxifen resistance using gain- and loss-of-function testing. By combining functional enrichment analysis and prediction algorithms, we identified three central tumour-suppressor genes (TSGs) in PI3K signalling and the cell cycle network as direct target genes of miR-519a. Combined expression of these target genes correlated with disease-specific survival in a cohort of tamoxifen-treated patients. We identified miRNA-519a as a novel oncomir in ER+ breast cancer cells as it increased cell viability and cell cycle progression as well as resistance to tamoxifen-induced apoptosis. Finally, we could show that elevated miRNA-519a levels were inversely correlated with the target genes' expression and that higher expression of this miRNA correlated with poorer survival in ER+ breast cancer patients. Hence we have identified miRNA-519a as a novel oncomir, co-regulating a network of TSGs in breast cancer and conferring resistance to tamoxifen. Using inhibitors of such miRNAs may serve as a novel therapeutic approach to combat resistance to therapy as well as proliferation and evasion of apoptosis in breast cancer.

Recently, we demonstrated the ability of a broad-spectrum sunscreen to prevent UV-induced damage both in patients with CLE and healthy controls (HCs). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the UV-dependent activation of interferon (IFN)-driven inflammation in CLE can also be prevented by application of the sunscreen. In 20 patients with different subtypes of CLE and 10 HCs, defined areas on the upper back were treated with a broad-spectrum liposomal sunscreen 20 min prior to a combined standardized UVA/UVB irradiation. Immunohistological analyses using antibodies directed against MxA, CD11c, CD123 and CD68 were performed from skin biopsies taken from areas before UV irradiation as well as from sunscreen-treated and sunscreen-untreated areas 24 and 72 h after UV irradiation. The expression of MxA was completely prevented by the sunscreen applied prior to UV irradiation in CLE patients and HCs. Additionally, sunscreen protection significantly diminished the number of the CD11c- and CD123-positive dendritic cells, which are suggested to be a major source of type I/III IFNs, in UV-irradiated skin of patients with CLE. Moreover, the application of the sunscreen prevented the increase in CD68-positive macrophages in both groups 72 h after UV irradiation. The data of this study demonstrate that UV protection reduces lesional tissue damage and inhibits the typical IFN-driven inflammatory response in CLE.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (7), 516-518</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>516</StrtPage><EndPage>518</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Zahn S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Graef M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Patsinakidis N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Landmann A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Surber C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Wenzel J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Kuhn A" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24758584</PMID><DOI>10.1111/exd.12428</DOI><KST>D030</KST><KEYWORD>LESIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52173</publishedID><Artikel>Toll-like receptor genetic variants and colorectal cancer</Artikel><Journal>OncoImmunology</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>3 (1), e27763-</Feld596><PubVol>3</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>e27763</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Weber,A.N.R."

QT prolongation is a risk factor for ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD) and could indicate the presence of the potentially lethal mendelian long-QT syndrome (LQTS). Using a genome-wide association and replication study in up to 100,000 individuals, we identified 35 common variant loci associated with QT interval that collectively explain similar to 8-10% of QT-interval variation and highlight the importance of calcium regulation in myocardial repolarization. Rare variant analysis of 6 new QT interval-associated loci in 298 unrelated probands with LQTS identified coding variants not found in controls but of uncertain causality and therefore requiring validation. Several newly identified loci encode proteins that physically interact with other recognized repolarization proteins. Our integration of common variant association, expression and orthogonal protein-protein interaction screens provides new insights into cardiac electrophysiology and identifies new candidate genes for ventricular arrhythmias, LQTS and SCD.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>46 (8), 826-836</Feld596><PubVol>46</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>826</StrtPage><EndPage>836</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Arking,D.E."

Abnormal eating behavior is thought to be a developmental trajectory to obesity. The Eating Pattern Inventory for Children (EPI-C) has not been used for children as young as eight years, and possible associations with body weight have not yet been established. Five hundred and twenty-one children of the Ulm Birth Cohort Study (UBCS; age eight) filled out the EPI-C and BMI was assessed. Adequacy of the scales was tested with confirmatory factor analysis and a MANOVA and cluster analysis established associations between eating patterns and BMI.

There is substantial evidence suggesting that diet markedly affects the composition of the intestinal microbiota. Moreover, there is now unequivocal evidence linking dysbiosis to cancer development. However, the mechanisms by which high-fat diet (HFD)-mediated changes in the microbial community affect the severity of tumorigenesis in the gut remain to be determined. Here we demonstrate that an HFD promotes tumour progression in the small intestine of genetically susceptible, K-rasG12Dint, mice independently of obesity. HFD consumption, in conjunction with K-ras mutation, mediated a shift in the composition of the gut microbiota, and this shift was associated with a decrease in Paneth-cell-mediated antimicrobial host defence that compromised dendritic cell recruitment and MHC class II molecule presentation in the gut-associated lymphoid tissues. When butyrate was administered to HFD-fed K-rasG12Dint mice, dendritic cell recruitment in the gut-associated lymphoid tissues was normalized, and tumour progression was attenuated. Importantly, deficiency in MYD88, a signalling adaptor for pattern recognition receptors and Toll-like receptors, blocked tumour progression. The transfer of faecal samples from HFD-fed mice with intestinal tumours to healthy adult K-rasG12Dint mice was sufficient to transmit disease in the absence of an HFD. Furthermore, treatment with antibiotics completely blocked HFD-induced tumour progression, suggesting that distinct shifts in the microbiota have a pivotal role in aggravating disease. Collectively, these data underscore the importance of the reciprocal interaction between host and environmental factors in selecting a microbiota that favours carcinogenesis, and they suggest that tumorigenesis is transmissible among genetically predisposed individuals.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>514 (7523), 508-512</Feld596><PubVol>514</PubVol><PubIss>7523</PubIss><StrtPage>508</StrtPage><EndPage>512</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schulz MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Atay C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Heringer J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Romrig FK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schwitalla S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Aydin B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Ziegler PK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Varga J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Reindl W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Pommerenke C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Salinas-Riester G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Bock A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Alpert C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Blaut M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Polson SC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Brandl L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Kirchner T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="17" name="Greten FR" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="18" name="Polson SW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Arkan MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25174708</PMID><DOI>10.1038/nature13398</DOI><KST>L401</KST><KST>L701</KST><KEYWORD>INTERFACE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SEQUENCES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METABOLISM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>inflammation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INNATE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROBE LEVEL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MICROBIAL ECOLOGY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GUT MICROBIOME</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52251</publishedID><Artikel>Heterogeneous Antibody-Based Activity Assay for Lysine Specific Demethylase 1 (LSD1) on a Histone Peptide Substrate</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Biomolecular Screening</Journal><ABSTr>Posttranslational modifications of histone tails are very important for epigenetic gene regulation. The lysine-specific demethylase LSD1 (KDM1A/AOF2) demethylates in vitro predominantly mono- and dimethylated lysine 4 on histone 3 (H3K4) and is a promising target for drug discovery. We report a heterogeneous antibody-based assay, using dissociation-enhanced lanthanide fluorescent immunoassay (DELFIA) for the detection of LSD1 activity. We used a biotinylated histone 3 peptide (amino acids 1-21) with monomethylated lysine 4 (H3K4me) as the substrate for the detection of LSD1 activity with antibody-mediated quantitation of the demethylated product. We have successfully used the assay to measure the potency of reference inhibitors. The advantage of the heterogeneous format is shown with cumarin-based LSD1 inhibitor candidates that we have identified using virtual screening. They had shown good potency in an established LSD1 screening assay. The new heterogeneous assay identified them as false positives, which was verified using mass spectrometry.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>19 (6), 973-978</Feld596><PubVol>19</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>973</StrtPage><EndPage>978</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schmitt ML" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Ladwein KI" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Carlino L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schulz-Fincke J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Willmann D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Metzger E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Schilcher P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Imhof A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Schuele R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Sippl W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Jung M" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24687155</PMID><KST>L601</KST></row><row><publishedID>52252</publishedID><Artikel>Sustained focal antitumor activity of bevacizumab in recurrent glioblastoma</Artikel><Journal>Neurology</Journal><ABSTr>OBJECTIVES: To investigate the relevance of bevacizumab (BEV)-induced diffusion-restricted lesions and T1-hyperintense lesions in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. METHODS: We prospectively screened 74 BEV-treated patients with recurrent glioblastoma for (1) diffusion-restricted lesions and/or, (2) lesions with a hyperintense signal on precontrast T1-weighted images. We further evaluated overall survival (OS), histopathology of the lesions, and patterns of progression. RESULTS: Twenty-five of 74 patients (34%) developed T1-hyperintense lesions, whereas diffusion-restricted lesions could be detected in 35 of 74 patients (47%). In 21 of 74 patients (28%), the lesions displayed both features ("double-positive"). OS for patients with double-positive lesions was 13.0 months; patients with neither of these lesions had an OS of 6.6 months (p &lt; 0.005). Histologic evaluation of double-positive lesions revealed extensive calcified necrosis in 4 of 4 patients. Notably, these double-positive lesions were rarely involved in further tumor progression. However, they were associated with an increase in distant recurrences at BEV failure. CONCLUSIONS: BEV-induced double-positive MRI lesions are a predictive imaging marker associated with a substantial survival benefit and with improved local control in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. Our data suggest that these lesions are the result of a sustained focal antitumor activity of BEV.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>83 (3), 227-234</Feld596><PubVol>83</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>227</StrtPage><EndPage>234</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Baehr O" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Harter PN" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Weise LM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="You SJ" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Mittelbronn M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Ronellenfitsch MW" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Rieger J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Steinbach JP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Hattingen E" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24928118</PMID><DOI>10.1212/WNL.0000000000000594</DOI><KST>L501</KST></row><row><publishedID>52253</publishedID><Artikel>Comparison of Somatostatin Receptor Agonist and Antagonist for Peptide Receptor Radionuclide Therapy: A Pilot Study</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Nuclear Medicine</Journal><ABSTr>Preclinical and clinical studies have indicated that somatostatin receptor (sst)-expressing tumors demonstrate higher uptake of radiolabeled sst antagonists than of sst agonists. In 4 consecutive patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors, we evaluated whether treatment with 177Lu-labeled sst antagonists is feasible. METHODS: After injection of approximately 1 GBq of 177Lu-DOTA-[Cpa-c(DCys-Aph(Hor)-DAph(Cbm)-Lys-Thr-Cys)-DTyr-NH2] (177Lu-DOTA-JR11) and 177Lu-DOTATATE, 3-dimensional voxel dosimetry analysis based on SPECT/CT was performed. A higher tumor-to-organ dose ratio for 177Lu-DOTA-JR11 than for 177Lu-DOTATATE was the prerequisite for treatment with 177Lu-DOTA-JR11. RESULTS: Reversible minor adverse effects of 177Lu-DOTA-JR11 were observed. 177Lu-DOTA-JR11 showed a 1.7-10.6 times higher tumor dose than 177Lu-DOTATATE. At the same time, the tumor-to-kidney and tumor-to-bone marrow dose ratio was 1.1-7.2 times higher. All 4 patients were treated with 177Lu-DOTA-JR11, resulting in partial remission in 2 patients, stable disease in 1 patient, and mixed response in the other patient. CONCLUSION: Treatment of neuroendocrine tumors with radiolabeled sst antagonists is clinically feasible and may have a significant impact on peptide receptor radionuclide therapy.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>55 (8), 1248-1252</Feld596><PubVol>55</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>1248</StrtPage><EndPage>1252</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Wild D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Fani M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Fischer R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Del Pozzo L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kaul F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Krebs S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Fischer R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Rivier JE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Reubi JC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Maecke HR" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Weber WA" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24963127</PMID><KST>L601</KST></row><row><publishedID>52254</publishedID><Artikel>Increased microtubule assembly rates influence chromosomal instability in colorectal cancer cells</Artikel><Journal>Nature Cell Biology</Journal><ABSTr>Chromosomal instability (CIN) is defined as the perpetual missegregation of whole chromosomes during mitosis and represents a hallmark of human cancer. However, the mechanisms influencing CIN and its consequences on tumour growth are largely unknown. We identified an increase in microtubule plus-end assembly rates as a mechanism influencing CIN in colorectal cancer cells. This phenotype is induced by overexpression of the oncogene AURKA or by loss of the tumour suppressor gene CHK2, a genetic constitution found in 73% of human colorectal cancers. Increased microtubule assembly rates are associated with transient abnormalities in mitotic spindle geometry promoting the generation of lagging chromosomes and influencing CIN. Reconstitution of proper microtubule assembly rates by chemical or genetic means suppresses CIN and thereby, unexpectedly, accelerates tumour growth in vitro and in vivo. Thus, we identify a fundamental mechanism influencing CIN in cancer cells and reveal its adverse consequence on tumour growth.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>16 (8), 779-791</Feld596><PubVol>16</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>779</StrtPage><EndPage>791</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ertych N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Stolz A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Stenzinger A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Weichert W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kaulfuss S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Burfeind P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Aigner A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Wordeman L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Bastians H" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24976383</PMID><DOI>10.1038/ncb2994</DOI><KST>L101</KST></row><row><publishedID>52255</publishedID><Artikel>A vaccine targeting mutant IDH1 induces antitumour immunity</Artikel><Journal>Nature</Journal><ABSTr>Monoallelic point mutations of isocitrate dehydrogenase type 1 (IDH1) are an early and defining event in the development of a subgroup of gliomas and other types of tumour. They almost uniformly occur in the critical arginine residue (Arg 132) in the catalytic pocket, resulting in a neomorphic enzymatic function, production of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), genomic hypermethylation, genetic instability and malignant transformation. More than 70% of diffuse grade II and grade III gliomas carry the most frequent mutation, IDH1(R132H) (ref. 3). From an immunological perspective, IDH1(R132H) represents a potential target for immunotherapy as it is a tumour-specific potential neoantigen with high uniformity and penetrance expressed in all tumour cells. Here we demonstrate that IDH1(R132H) contains an immunogenic epitope suitable for mutation-specific vaccination. Peptides encompassing the mutated region are presented on major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) class II and induce mutation-specific CD4(+) T-helper-1 (TH1) responses. CD4(+) TH1 cells and antibodies spontaneously occurring in patients with IDH1(R132H)-mutated gliomas specifically recognize IDH1(R132H). Peptide vaccination of mice devoid of mouse MHC and transgenic for human MHC class I and II with IDH1(R132H) p123-142 results in an effective MHC class II-restricted mutation-specific antitumour immune response and control of pre-established syngeneic IDH1(R132H)-expressing tumours in a CD4(+) T-cell-dependent manner. As IDH1(R132H) is present in all tumour cells of these slow-growing gliomas, a mutation-specific anti-IDH1(R132H) vaccine may represent a viable novel therapeutic strategy for IDH1(R132H)-mutated tumours.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>512 (7514), 324-327</Feld596><PubVol>512</PubVol><PubIss>7514</PubIss><StrtPage>324</StrtPage><EndPage>327</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schumacher, T."

Response to the treatment, overall survival and recurrence show inter-individual variation.

Methods: In this study we employed a strategy to search eQTL variants influencing the expression of a large number of genes. We identified four single nucleotide polymorphisms, defined as master regulators of transcription, and genotyped them in a set of 218 colorectal cancer patients undergoing adjuvant 5-FU based therapy.

Results: Our results showed that the minor allele variant of the rs4846126 polymorphism was associated with poor overall and progression-free survival. Patients that were homozygous for the variant allele showed an over two fold increased risk of death (HR 2.20 95%CI 1.05-4.60) and progression (HR 2.88, 95% 1.47-5.63). The integration of external information from publicly available gene expression repositories suggested that the rs4846126 polymorphism deserves further investigation. This variant potentially regulates the gene expression of 273 genes with some of them possibly associated to the patient's response to 5-FU treatment or colorectal cancer.

Conclusions: Present results show that mining of public data repositories in combination with own data can be a fruitful approach to identify markers that affect therapy outcome. In particular, a genetic screen of master regulators may help in order to search for the polymorphisms involved in treatment response in cancer patients.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>766 (), 7-13</Feld596><PubVol>766</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>7</StrtPage><EndPage>13</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Pardini,B."

We propose extending the number of imaging channels by using chemical reactions, controlling the emissive state of fluorescent dyes. As proof of concept, we reversibly switch a fluorescent copper sensor to enable successive imaging of two different structures in the same spectral channel. We also show that this chemical multiplexing is orthogonal to existing methods. By using two different dyes, we combine chemical with spectral multiplexing for the simultaneous imaging of four different structures with only two spectrally different channels.

Allowing the continuous localization of medical instruments and patient anatomy, it is a prerequisite for providing instrument guidance to subsurface anatomical structures. The only widely used technique that enables real-time tracking of small objects without line-of-sight restrictions is electromagnetic (EM) tracking. While EM tracking has been the subject of many research efforts, clinical applications have been slow to emerge. The aim of this review paper is therefore to provide insight into the future potential and limitations of EM tracking for medical use. We describe the basic working principles of EM tracking systems, list the main sources of error, and summarize the published studies on tracking accuracy, precision and robustness along with the corresponding validation protocols proposed. State-of-the-art approaches to error compensation are also reviewed in depth. Finally, an overview of the clinical applications addressed with EM tracking is given. Throughout the paper, we report not only on scientific progress, but also provide a review on commercial systems. Given the continuous debate on the applicability of EM tracking in medicine, this paper provides a timely overview of the state-of-the-art in the field.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>33 (8), 1702-1725</Feld596><PubVol>33</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>1702</StrtPage><EndPage>1725</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Franz AM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Haidegger T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Birkfellner W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Cleary K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Peters TM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Maier-Hein L" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24816547</PMID><DOI>10.1109/TMI.2014.2321777</DOI><KST>E130</KST><KST>E131</KST><KEYWORD>FIELD-BASED NAVIGATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY PROCEDURES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ULTRASOUND-GUIDED INTERVENTIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TIME VIRTUAL SONOGRAPHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MAGNETIC NAVIGATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LOCALIZATION SYSTEM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACCURACY ASSESSMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STANDARDIZED ASSESSMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASSESSMENT PROTOCOL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RADIOFREQUENCY ABLATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52277</publishedID><Artikel>The novel centriolar satellite protein SSX2IP targets Cep290 to the ciliary transition zone</Artikel><Journal>Molecular Biology of the Cell</Journal><ABSTr>In differentiated human cells, primary cilia fulfill essential functions in converting mechanical or chemical stimuli into intracellular signals. Formation and maintenance of cilia require multiple functions associated with the centriole-derived basal body, from which axonemal microtubules grow and which assembles a gate to maintain the specific ciliary proteome. Here we characterize the function of a novel centriolar satellite protein, synovial sarcoma X breakpoint-interacting protein 2 (SSX2IP), in the assembly of primary cilia. We show that SSX2IP localizes to the basal body of primary cilia in human and murine ciliated cells. Using small interfering RNA knockdown in human cells, we demonstrate the importance of SSX2IP for efficient recruitment of the ciliopathy-associated satellite protein Cep290 to both satellites and the basal body. Cep290 takes a central role in gating proteins to the ciliary compartment. Consistent with that, loss of SSX2IP drastically reduces entry of the BBSome, which functions to target membrane proteins to primary cilia, and interferes with efficient accumulation of the key regulator of ciliary membrane protein targeting, Rab8. Finally, we show that SSX2IP knockdown limits targeting of the ciliary membrane protein and BBSome cargo, somatostatin receptor 3, and significantly reduces axoneme length. Our data establish SSX2IP as a novel targeting factor for ciliary membrane proteins cooperating with Cep290, the BBSome, and Rab8.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>25 (4), 495-507</Feld596><PubVol>25</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>495</StrtPage><EndPage>507</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Klinger M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Wang W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kuhns S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Barenz F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Drager-Meurer S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Pereira G" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Gruss OJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24356449</PMID><DOI>10.1091/mbc.E13-09-0526</DOI><KST>A180</KST><KEYWORD>MEMBRANE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMPLEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ciliogenesis</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PRIMARY CILIUM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTRAFLAGELLAR TRANSPORT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>centrosome</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SENSORY ORGANELLE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLS ANTENNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BASAL BODIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BBS PROTEINS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52280</publishedID><Artikel>Determinants of newly diagnosed comorbidities among breast cancer survivors</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Cancer Survivorship</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: Comorbid conditions have become increasingly relevant for breast cancer care given the large numbers of long-term survivors.

Tumor and therapy data were extracted from medical records. Determinants potentially associated with incident diagnoses of hypertension, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and osteoporosis were assessed using multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models. RESULTS: Follow-up interview was completed by 2,542 women (76.4 % of eligible patients). A diagnosis of hypertension was significantly associated with age, higher education (hazard ratio (HR) 0.54, CI 0.37-0.79), baseline body mass index (BMI; &gt;/=30 kg/m(2); HR, 1.90; CI, 1.24-2.90), and trastuzumab medication (HR, 2.16; CI, 1.09-4.33). An increased risk for CVD was associated with age, BMI, and intake of aromatase inhibitors (AI; HR, 1.42; CI, 1.09-1.84). Risk of osteoporosis was also positively associated with AI treatment (HR, 2.15; CI, 1.64-2.82) but inversely associated with a higher BMI (&gt;/=30 kg/m(2); HR, 0.50; CI, 0.31-0.79). CONCLUSION: In breast cancer survivors, treatment with AI constituted a risk factor for incident CVD and osteoporosis. Besides known risk factors, patients who were treated with trastuzumab may have an increased risk for hypertension. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Reducing overweight and regular sport/cycling activities may help to prevent CVD after breast cancer. Patients should be monitored for risk factors and advised on possible cardiac side effects of AI and trastuzumab.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>8 (3), 384-393</Feld596><PubVol>8</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>384</StrtPage><EndPage>393</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Obi N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Gornyk D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Heinz J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Vrieling A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Seibold P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Chang-Claude J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Flesch-Janys D" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24570215</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s11764-013-0338-y</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>ADJUVANT ENDOCRINE THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AROMATASE INHIBITORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEART-FAILURE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METAANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRASTUZUMAB</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COHORT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEALTH</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52281</publishedID><Artikel>Isolation, structural analyses and biological activity assays against chronic lymphocytic leukemia of two novel cytochalasins - sclerotionigrin A and B</Artikel><Journal>Molecules</Journal><ABSTr>Two new cytochalasins, sclerotionigrin A (1) and B (2) were isolated together with the known proxiphomin (3) from the filamentous fungus Aspergillus sclerotioniger.

Increasing the antileukemic efficacy of the pretransplant conditioning regimen may be a strategy to increase remission rates and duration. We therefore investigated the antiproliferative effects of nilotinib in combination with drugs that are usually used for conditioning: the alkylating agents mafosfamide, treosulfan, and busulfan.

Drug combinations were tested in vitro in different imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL-positive cell lines. A tetrazolium-based MTT assay was used for the assessment and quantification of growth inhibition after exposure to alkylating agents alone or to combinations with nilotinib. Drug interaction was analyzed using the median-effect method of Chou and Talalay, and combination index (CI) values were calculated according to the classic isobologram equation.

Treatment of imatinib-sensitive, BCR-ABL-positive K562 and LAMA84 cells with nilotinib in combination with mafosfamide, treosulfan, or busulfan resulted in synergistic (CI &lt; 1), additive (CI similar to 1), and predominantly antagonistic (CI &gt; 1) effects, respectively. In imatinib-resistant K562-R and LAMA84-R cells, all applied drug combinations were synergistic (CI &lt; 1) at higher growth inhibition levels.

Our in vitro data warrant further investigation and may provide the basis for nilotinib-supplemented conditioning regimens for allo-SCT in advanced-phase CML.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>74 (2), 427-432</Feld596><PubVol>74</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>427</StrtPage><EndPage>432</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Radujkovic A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Luft T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Dreger P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Ho AD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Zeller J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Fruehauf S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Topaly J" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25038611</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00280-014-2533-6</DOI><KST>G402</KST><KEYWORD>SYNERGISTIC ACTIVITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MANAGEMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BCR-ABL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMATINIB-RESISTANT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>KINASE INHIBITOR STI571</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TOXICITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHRONIC MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STEM-CELL TRANSPLANTATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52283</publishedID><Artikel>DENR-MCT-1 promotes translation re-initiation downstream of uORFs to control tissue growth</Artikel><Journal>Nature</Journal><ABSTr>During cap-dependent eukaryotic translation initiation, ribosomes scan messenger RNA from the 5' end to the first AUG start codon with favourable sequence context. For many mRNAs this AUG belongs to a short upstream open reading frame (uORF), and translation of the main downstream ORF requires re-initiation, an incompletely understood process. Re-initiation is thought to involve the same factors as standard initiation. It is unknown whether any factors specifically affect translation re-initiation without affecting standard cap-dependent translation. Here we uncover the non-canonical initiation factors density regulated protein (DENR) and multiple copies in T-cell lymphoma-1 (MCT-1; also called MCTS1 in humans) as the first selective regulators of eukaryotic re-initiation. mRNAs containing upstream ORFs with strong Kozak sequences selectively require DENR-MCT-1 for their proper translation, yielding a novel class of mRNAs that can be co-regulated and that is enriched for regulatory proteins such as oncogenic kinases. Collectively, our data reveal that cells have a previously unappreciated translational control system with a key role in supporting proliferation and tissue growth.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>512 (7513), 208-212</Feld596><PubVol>512</PubVol><PubIss>7513</PubIss><StrtPage>208</StrtPage><EndPage>212</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schleich S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Strassburger K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Janiesch PC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Koledachkina T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Miller KK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Haneke K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Cheng YS" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Kuechler K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Stoecklin G" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Duncan KE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Teleman AA" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25043021</PMID><DOI>10.1038/nature13401</DOI><KST>A200</KST><KST>B140</KST><KEYWORD>MAMMALIAN-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Drosophila</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DOSAGE COMPENSATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OPEN READING FRAMES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INSULIN-RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MSL-2 MESSENGER-RNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANDIDATE ONCOGENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SEX-LETHAL</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52285</publishedID><Artikel>HLA-C -35kb Expression SNP Is Associated with Differential Control of beta-HPV Infection in Squamous Cell Carcinoma Cases and Controls</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 35 kb upstream of the HLA-C gene is associated with HLA-C expression, and the high expressing genotype (CC) has been associated with HIV-I control. HLA-C is unique among the classical MHC class I molecules for its role in the control of viral infections and recognition of abnormal or missing self. This immunosurveillance is central to the pathogenesis of non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), and of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in particular. While sun exposure is a major risk factor for these cancers, cutaneous infections with genus beta-HPV have been implicated in the development of SCC. We hypothesized that the high expression HLA-C genotype is associated with beta-HPV infections. Therefore, we investigated the association between beta-HPV serology and the -35 kb SNP (rs9264942) in a population-based case-control study of 510 SCC cases and 608 controls. Among controls, the high expression -35 kb SNP genotype (CC) reduced the likelihood of positive serology for multiple (&gt;/=2) beta-HPV infections (OR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.25-0.97), and beta-HPV species 2 infection (OR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.23-0.79). However, no association with beta-HPV status was observed among SCC cases. Our findings suggest that underlying immunogenotype plays an important role in differential control of beta-HPV in SCC cases and controls.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (8), e103710-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>e103710</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Vineretsky KA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Karagas MR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kuriger-Laber JK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Waterboer T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Pawlita M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Nelson HH" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25083782</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0103710</DOI><KST>F020</KST><KEYWORD>HLA-C</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMMUNE-SURVEILLANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPIDERMODYSPLASIA-VERRUCIFORMIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SKIN-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>glutathione-S-transferase</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BASAL-CELL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS INFECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POPULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SYSTEM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DELTA T-CELLS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52288</publishedID><Artikel>Seroprevalence of 8 oncogenic human papillomavirus genotypes and acquired immunity against reinfection</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Infectious Diseases</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Natural human papillomavirus (HPV) antibody titers have shown protection against subsequent HPV infection, but previous studies were restricted to few HPV genotypes. We examined the association of naturally occurring antibodies against 8 carcinogenic HPV types with subsequent infections. METHODS: A total of 2302 women enrolled in the Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance/Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion Triage Study provided blood samples at baseline. Serum samples were tested for antibodies against 8 carcinogenic HPV genotypes (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 45, 52, and 58) using a multiplex serology assay. We analyzed the relationship between HPV antibodies and HPV infection during 2 years of follow-up among women negative for the specific HPV type at baseline. RESULTS: Baseline seroprevalence for HPV16 L1 was associated with decreased risk of DNA positivity for HPV16 (odds ratio, 0.39 [95% confidence interval, .18-.86]) at &gt;/=2 follow-up visits. We observed similar but nonsignificant decreased risks for HPV18 and 31. These findings were restricted to women reporting a new sex partner during follow-up. There was no association between baseline seroprevalence and detection of precancer during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Seroprevalence conferred protection against subsequent HPV infection for HPV16 and indicated possible protection for 2 other genotypes, suggesting that this effect is common to several HPV genotypes.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>210 (3), 448-455</Feld596><PubVol>210</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>448</StrtPage><EndPage>455</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Wilson L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Pawlita M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Castle PE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Waterboer T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Sahasrabuddhe V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Gravitt PE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Schiffman M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Wentzensen N" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24569064</PMID><DOI>10.1093/infdis/jiu104</DOI><KST>F020</KST><KEYWORD>NATURAL-HISTORY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VIRUS-LIKE PARTICLES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>UNDETERMINED SIGNIFICANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>QUADRIVALENT VACCINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>glutathione-S-transferase</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HPV INFECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>YOUNG-WOMEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SQUAMOUS INTRAEPITHELIAL LESION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASCUS-LSIL TRIAGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA DETECTION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52322</publishedID><Artikel>A standardized staining protocol for L1CAM on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues using automated platforms</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Biological Markers</Journal><ABSTr>The L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) is overexpressed in many human cancers and can serve as a biomarker for prognosis in most of these cancers (including type I endometrial carcinomas).

Particularly in adolescence, asthma may be under-diagnosed and undertreated or poorly managed. Therefore, we aimed to determine the association between childhood wheezing phenotypes rather than asthma and adolescent HRQoL in children aged 10-17yr.

MethodsWe analyzed the data from two prospective population-based cohort studies (n=604 and n=1804) conducted in southern Germany with baseline assessments in 2000 and 2006 and follow-ups at frequent intervals. Parent-reported wheeze was categorized into never, early transient, persistent, and late-onset wheeze. We assessed child-reported HRQoL in seven scales using the validated KINDL-R. Multivariate linear regression models were computed.

ResultsParticipants with late-onset wheeze had significantly lower values in all HRQoL scales, but physical well-being compared to never wheezers. Early transient wheeze was negatively associated with three HRQoL scales only (family, school, and total). These effects were confined to the oldest age group (13.5yr) in one study. Persistent wheeze was not associated with HRQoL.

ConclusionsIn teenagers, late-onset wheezers seem to be particularly vulnerable for impairments in psychosocial aspects of health-related quality of life. They may therefore require particular attention with regard to education about asthma management and potentially family-based psychosocial intervention.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>25 (8), 781-787</Feld596><PubVol>25</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>781</StrtPage><EndPage>787</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Braig S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Brandt S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Wabitsch M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Florath I" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Rothenbacher D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Genuneit J" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25229563</PMID><DOI>10.1111/pai.12280</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>PRESCHOOL-CHILDREN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHILDHOOD</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BIRTH COHORT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>asthma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MANAGEMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BODY-MASS INDEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENDER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SCHOOL-CHILDREN</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52351</publishedID><Artikel>PNPLA3 in end-stage liver disease: Alcohol consumption, hepatocellular carcinoma development, and transplantation-free survival</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology</Journal><ABSTr>Background and Aims: The rs738409 variant (I148M) of the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) gene is associated with several liver malfunctions. Its impact on end-stage liver disease has not been addressed yet.

Methods: The I148M polymorphism was genotyped in a well-characterized cohort of 421 Caucasian patients and retrospectively analyzed from the time of enrollment at Eurotransplant.

Results: The G allele of the I148M variant was significantly overrepresented in patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD, P &lt; 0.001) and associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development (odds ratio [OR] = 2.399; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.292-4.455; P = 0.008) while not affecting the other liver disease entities. Time until hydropic decompensation (P = 0.04) and hepatic encephalopathy (P = 0.043) was significantly impaired for ALD patients carrying either one or two mutated G alleles. Actuarial survival free of liver transplantation was further reduced for ALD carriers of the I148M variant (CC = 30.7 months +/- 7.9, 95% CI: 15.1-46.2 vs CG/GG: 17.1 months +/- 3.3, 95% CI: 3.3-10.6; P = 0.012) compared with wild-type patients. Cox multivariate analysis identified the PNPLA3 I148M genotype as an independent predictor actuarial survival free of liver transplantation (OR = 1.77; 95% CI: 1.27-2.47; P = 0.001).

Conclusions: In end-stage liver disease patients, we identified ALD to be predominantly affected by the PNPLA3 I148M variant resulting in an increased risk of HCC and reduced transplantation free survival. Genetic testing of the I148M genotype in ALD patients awaiting liver transplantation might be beneficial for these patients.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>29 (7), 1477-1484</Feld596><PubVol>29</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>1477</StrtPage><EndPage>1484</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Friedrich,K."

Protein translocation is constrained due to the cellular organization into subcompartments that impose diffusion barriers and guide enzymatic activities to their targets. Here, we introduce an approach to retrieve structural features from the scale-dependent mobility of green fluorescent protein monomer and multimers in human cells. We measure protein transport simultaneously between hundreds of positions by multi-scale fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy using a line-illuminating confocal microscope. From these data we derive a quantitative model of the intracellular architecture that resembles a random obstacle network for diffusing proteins. This topology partitions the cellular content and increases the dwell time of proteins in their local environment. The accessibility of obstacle surfaces depends on protein size. Our method links multi-scale mobility measurements with a quantitative description of intracellular structure that can be applied to evaluate how drug-induced perturbations affect protein transport and interactions.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>5 (), Art.

At present, the enzymatic activity of the protein has been the main topic in investigating its physiological function, but its signaling pathway allocation was unsuccessful. Interestingly, proteins regulated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling, are among the top downregulated genes in gliomas associated with high percentage of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations. The aim of this study was to investigate a hypothetical relation between IDH1 and PI3K signaling. METHODS: The presence of mutant IDH1 and markers for active PI3K/Akt signaling, present as phosphorylated Akt and podoplanin (PDPN), were investigated in a discovery cohort of 354 patients with glioma. In vitro experiments were used to confirm functional links. RESULTS: This study shows an inverse correlation between mutant IDH1 and markers for active PI3K/Akt signaling.

So far, a variety of surrogate markers have been proposed to enrich these cells, emphasizing the need to devise new characterization methods. Here, we screen a large panel of glioblastoma cultures (n = 21) cultivated under stem cell-permissive conditions and identify several cell lines with enhanced self-renewal capacity. These cell lines are capable of matrix-independent growth and form fast-growing, orthotopic tumours in mice. Employing isolation, re-plating, and label-retention techniques, we show that self-renewal potential of individual cells is partitioned asymmetrically between daughter cells in a robust and cell line-specific fashion. This yields populations of fast- and slow-cycling cells, which differ in the expression of cell cycle-associated transcripts. Intriguingly, fast-growing cells keep their slow-cycling counterparts in a reversible state of quiescence associated with high chemoresistance. Our results suggest that two different subpopulations of tumour cells contribute to aberrant growth and tumour recurrence after therapy in glioblastoma.

METHODS: A population-based cohort (Swedish Family-Cancer Database) of 14,267 RCC patients diagnosed in 1990-2010 was followed for cancer incidence. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for subsequent cancers in RCC survivors and in RCC survivors with a family history of subsequent cancer. Familial risk of subsequent cancer was calculated for individuals with family history of specific cancer, compared to those without. RESULTS: For subsequent hemangioblastoma (HB) in RCC survivors, drastically elevated risk was observed for the effect of family history of HB [SIR=777 (95% confidence interval (CI): 160-2270)] and of family history of RCC [378 (46-1367)]. Colorectal, lung, prostate and RCCs favoured additive interactions between risk of subsequent cancers in RCC survivors and familial risk, while endocrine glands, nervous system and urinary bladder cancers favoured multiplicative interactions. CONCLUSIONS: Risks of subsequent HB in RCC survivors were tremendously modified by family history of RCC or HB, which may resemble characteristics of von Hippel-Lindau syndrome and show the power of present approach to detect heritable cancer clusters. Additive or multiplicative interactions found for colorectal, lung, prostate, endocrine glands, nervous system, urinary bladder and RCCs might raise awareness among clinicians and RCC survivors with a family history of seven cancers about elevated risks of subsequent those cancers.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>50 (12), 2108-2118</Feld596><PubVol>50</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>2108</StrtPage><EndPage>2118</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Chen T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Fallah M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Sundquist K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Liu H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Hemminki K" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24923229</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.ejca.2014.05.003</DOI><KST>C050</KST><KEYWORD>END</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SWEDISH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NORDIC COUNTRIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>KIDNEY-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STRATEGIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DATABASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BLADDER-CANCER</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52359</publishedID><Artikel>Vitamin D and cancer: an overview on epidemiological studies</Artikel><Journal>Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>810 (), 17-32</Feld596><PubVol>810</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>17</StrtPage><EndPage>32</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ordonez Mena JM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25207358</PMID><KST>C070</KST></row><row><publishedID>52361</publishedID><Artikel>Inherited variation in the PARP1 gene and survival from melanoma</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>We report the association of an inherited variant located upstream of the poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) gene (rs2249844), with survival in 11 BioGenoMEL melanoma cohorts. The gene encodes a protein involved in a number of cellular processes including single-strand DNA repair. Survival analysis was conducted for each cohort using proportional hazards regression adjusting for factors known to be associated with survival. Survival was measured as overall survival (OS) and, where available, melanoma-specific survival (MSS). Results were combined using random effects meta-analysis. Evidence for a role of the PARP1 protein in melanoma ulceration and survival was investigated by testing gene expression levels taken from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumors. A significant association was seen for inheritance of the rarer variant of PARP1, rs2249844 with OS (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.16 per allele, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.28, p = 0.005, eleven cohorts) and MSS (HR = 1.20 per allele, 95% CI 1.01-1.39, p = 0.03, eight cohorts). We report bioinformatic data supportive of a functional effect for rs2249844. Higher levels of PARP1 gene expression in tumors were shown to be associated with tumor ulceration and poorer OS.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>135 (7), 1625-1633</Feld596><PubVol>135</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>1625</StrtPage><EndPage>1633</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Davies JR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Jewell R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Affleck P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Anic GM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Randerson-Moor J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Ozola A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Egan KM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Elliott F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Garcia-Casado Z" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Hansson J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Harland M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Hoiom V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Jian G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Jonsson G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Kumar R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Nagore E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Wendt J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Olsson H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Park JY" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Patel P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Pjanova D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Puig S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Schadendorf D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Sivaramakrishna Rachakonda P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="24" name="Snowden H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Stratigos AJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Bafaloukos D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Ogbah Z" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Sucker A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Van den Oord JJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Van Doorn R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Walker C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Okamoto I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Wolter P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Barrett JH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Timothy Bishop D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Newton-Bishop J" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24535833</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28796</DOI><KST>C050</KST><KEYWORD>chemotherapy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>sensitivity</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CUTANEOUS MELANOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANDIDATE GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POLYMERASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOME BROWSER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SNP SELECTION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52362</publishedID><Artikel>Dairy products and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma: the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Intake of dairy products has been associated with risk of some cancers, but findings are often inconsistent and information on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk is limited, particularly from prospective settings. The aim of our study was to investigate the association between consumption of total and specific dairy products (milk/cheese/yogurt) and their components (calcium/vitamin D/fats/protein), with first incident HCC (N(cases) = 191) in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort, including a nested case-control subset (N(cases) = 122) with the assessment of hepatitis B virus/hepatitis C virus infections status, liver damage and circulating insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I levels. For cohort analyses, multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). For nested case-control analyses, conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95% CI. A total of 477,206 participants were followed-up for an average of 11 years (person-years follow-up = 5,415,385). In the cohort study, a significant positive HCC risk association was observed for total dairy products (highest vs. lowest tertile, HR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.13-2.43; p(trend) = 0.012), milk (HR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.02-2.24; p(trend) = 0.049), and cheese (HR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.02-2.38; p(trend) = 0.101), but not yogurt (HR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.65-1.35). Dietary calcium, vitamin D, fat and protein from dairy sources were associated with increased HCC risk, whereas the same nutrients from nondairy sources showed inverse or null associations. In the nested case-control study, similar results were observed among hepatitis-free individuals. Results from this large prospective cohort study suggest that higher consumption of dairy products, particularly milk and cheese, may be associated with increased HCC risk. Validation of these findings in other populations is necessary. Potential biologic mechanisms require further exploration.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>135 (7), 1662-1672</Feld596><PubVol>135</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>1662</StrtPage><EndPage>1672</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Duarte-Salles T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Fedirko V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Stepien M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Bamia C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Lagiou P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Lukanova A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Trepo E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Halkjaer J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Boutron-Ruault MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Racine A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Cadeau C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Kuehn T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Aleksandrova K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Trichopoulos D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Tsiotas K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Boffetta P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Palli D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Pala V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Sacerdote C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Panico S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Dik VK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Peeters PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Torhild Gram I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Hjartaker A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Ramon Quiros J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Fonseca-Nunes A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Molina-Montes E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Dorronsoro M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Navarro Sanchez C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Barricarte A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Lindkvist B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Sonestedt E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Johansson I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Wennberg M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Wareham N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Travis RC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Romieu I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="44" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="45" name="Jenab M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24615266</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28812</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>EPIC PROJECT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IGF-I</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IGFBP-3</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEPATITIS-B</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METAANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH-FACTOR-I</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COHORT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PRIMARY LIVER-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIET</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52363</publishedID><Artikel>Pre-diagnostic anthropometry and survival after colorectal cancer diagnosis in Western European populations</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>General and abdominal adiposity are associated with a high risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC), but the role of these exposures on cancer survival has been less studied. The association between pre-diagnostic anthropometric characteristics and CRC-specific and all-cause death was examined among 3,924 men and women diagnosed with CRC between 1992 and 2009 in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Over a mean follow-up period of 49 months, 1,309 deaths occurred of which 1,043 (79.7%) were due to CRC. In multivariable analysis, pre-diagnostic BMI &gt;/=30 kg/m(2) was associated with a high risk for CRC-specific (HR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.04-1.52) and all-cause (HR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.12-1.56) death relative to BMI &lt;25 kg/m(2) . Every 5 kg/m(2) increase in BMI was associated with a high risk for CRC-specific (HR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.02-1.19) and all-cause death (HR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.05-1.20); and every 10 cm increase in waist circumference was associated with a high risk for CRC-specific (HR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.02-1.16) and all-cause death (HR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.05-1.18). Similar associations were observed for waist-to-hip and waist-to-height ratios. Height was not associated with CRC-specific or all-cause death. Associations tended to be stronger among men than in women. Possible interactions by age at diagnosis, cancer stage, tumour location, and hormone replacement therapy use among postmenopausal women were noted. Pre-diagnostic general and abdominal adiposity are associated with lower survival after CRC diagnosis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>135 (8), 1949-1960</Feld596><PubVol>135</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>1949</StrtPage><EndPage>1960</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Fedirko V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Romieu I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Aleksandrova K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Pischon T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Trichopoulos D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Peeters PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Romaguera-Bosch D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Dahm CC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Chirlaque MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Johansen C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Bidstrup PE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Dalton SO" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Gunter MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Wark PA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Norat T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Halkjaer J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Dik VK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Siersema PD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Boutron-Ruault MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Dossus L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Bastide N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Kuehn T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="25" name="Kaaks R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="26" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Klinaki E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Katsoulis M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Pala V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Panico S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Palli D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Vineis P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Skeie G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Gonzalez CA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Sanchez MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Barricarte A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Amiano P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Quiros JR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Manjer J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Jirstrom K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="44" name="Ljuslinder I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="45" name="Palmqvist R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="46" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="47" name="Wareham N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="48" name="Bradbury KE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="49" name="Stepien M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="50" name="Duarte-Salles T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="51" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="52" name="Jenab M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24623514</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28841</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>OBESITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLON-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>nutrition</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BODY-MASS INDEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATIENT SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TREATMENT-RELATED TOXICITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VISCERAL ADIPOSITY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52364</publishedID><Artikel>EGFR, HER2 and HER3 dimerization patterns guide targeted inhibition in two histotypes of esophageal cancer</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are in the focus of targeted therapy for epithelial tumors. Our study addressed the role of EGFR, HER2 and HER3 expression and dimerization in esophageal cancers in situ and in vitro in the context of therapeutic EGFR and HER2 inhibitors. In archival pretreatment biopsies of esophageal carcinomas (n = 110), EGFR was preferentially expressed in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs) (22.4%; p = 0.088) and HER2 (34.4%; p &lt; 0.001) with HER3 (91.5%; p &lt; 0.001) in esophageal (Barrett's) adenocarcinomas (EACs). In situ proximity ligation assays revealed mainly EGFR and HER2 homodimers in ESCC and EAC cases, respectively. However, EAC cases also exhibited HER2/HER3 heterodimers. In vitro ESCC (OE21) cells displayed a significant response to erlotinib, gefitinib and lapatinib, with loss of AKT phosphorylation, G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. In EAC cells (OE19, OE33 and SK-GT-4), lapatinib was similarly effective in strongly HER2-positive (mainly HER2 homodimers and some HER2/EGFR heterodimers) OE19 and OE33 cells. The HER2-targeting antibodies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab) given alone were largely ineffective in ESCC and EAC cells. However, both antibodies significantly induced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in EAC (OE19 and OE33) cells upon co-culture with peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The study reveals that overexpression of EGFR and HER2 predominantly results in homodimers in ESCCs and EACs, respectively. Still, some EACs also show HER2 dimerization plasticity, e.g., with HER3. Such RTK dimerization patterns affect responses to EGFR and HER2 targeting inhibitors in ESCC and EAC cells in vitro and hence may influence future prediction for particularly HER2-targeting inhibitors in EACs.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>135 (7), 1517-1530</Feld596><PubVol>135</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>1517</StrtPage><EndPage>1530</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Fichter CD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Timme S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Braun JA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Gudernatsch V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schopflin A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Bogatyreva L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Geddert H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Faller G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Klimstra D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Tang L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Hauschke D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Werner M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Lassmann S" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24510732</PMID><KST>L601</KST><KEYWORD>HER-2/NEU GENE AMPLIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LABEL PHASE-3 TRIAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ESOPHAGOGASTRIC CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>JUNCTION CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>II TRIAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ARBEITSGEMEINSCHAFT INTERNISTISCHE ONKOLOGIE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BARRETTS-ESOPHAGUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH-FACTOR RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GASTRIC-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SQUAMOUS-CELL CARCINOMA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52365</publishedID><Artikel>A generalization of the bond fluctuation model to viscoelastic environments</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Physics / Condensed Matter</Journal><ABSTr>A lattice-based simulation method for polymer diffusion in a viscoelastic medium is presented.

In this contribution, we provide a theoretical assessment of this effect and compare the results to experimental data. A distinct distribution of polarization is found, which shares some features with experimental data and, interestingly, does not directly correspond to the loss of the singlet order of para-H2 . We derived expressions for the magnetic field and para-H2 -substrate interaction time, for which the polarization transfer is maximal. This work sheds light onto the effect of continuous hyperpolarization and elucidates the underlying mechanism, which may facilitate the development of an optimized catalyst. As an application, continuous hyperpolarization may enable highly sensitive nuclear magnetic resonance at very low magnetic fields, for example, for the cost-efficient screening of drugs.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>15 (12), 2451-2457</Feld596><PubVol>15</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>2451</StrtPage><EndPage>2457</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hoevener JB" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Knecht S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Schwaderlapp N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Hennig J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="von Elverfeldt D" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25079961</PMID><KST>L601</KST><KEYWORD>NMR-SPECTROSCOPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MRI</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>conversion</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ORDER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HYDROGEN INDUCED POLARIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CATALYSTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RESONANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REVERSIBLE EXCHANGE SABRE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HIGH MAGNETIC-FIELD</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SIGNAL AMPLIFICATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52368</publishedID><Artikel>Coexpressed auxiliary subunits exhibit distinct modulatory profiles on AMPA receptor function</Artikel><Journal>Neuron</Journal><ABSTr>Gating properties and surface trafficking of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are modulated by auxiliary subunits. Here we studied the function of coexpressed auxiliary subunits belonging to two different classes. We focused on TARP gamma-8 and CKAMP44 in dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells, since both subunits are highly expressed in this cell type. TARP gamma-8 and CKAMP44 decrease the rate of deactivation but have an opposing influence on receptor desensitization, which accounts for their differential modulation of synaptic short-term plasticity. Furthermore, long-term plasticity (LTP) requires TARP gamma-8 but not CKAMP44. The coexpression of both auxiliary subunits is necessary for the efficient targeting of AMPARs to the cell surface of DG granule cells. Finally, electrophysiological and biochemical evidence support the notion that CKAMP44 and TARP gamma-8 can be contained in the same AMPAR complex.

There is considerable molecular heterogeneity among colorectal tumors, which appears to arise as polyps progress to cancer. This heterogeneity results in different pathways to tumorigenesis. Although epigenetic and genetic alterations have been detected in conventional tubular adenomas, little is known about how these affect progression to CRC. We compared methylomes of normal colon mucosa, tubular adenomas, and colorectal cancers to determine how epigenetic alterations might contribute to cancer formation. METHODS: We conducted genome-wide array-based studies and comprehensive data analyses of aberrantly methylated loci in 41 normal colon tissue, 42 colon adenomas, and 64 cancers using HumanMethylation450 arrays. RESULTS: We found genome-wide alterations in DNA methylation in the nontumor colon mucosa and cancers. Three classes of cancers and 2 classes of adenomas were identified based on their DNA methylation patterns. The adenomas separated into classes of high-frequency methylation and low-frequency methylation. Within the high-frequency methylation adenoma class a subset of adenomas had mutant KRAS. Additionally, the high-frequency methylation adenoma class had DNA methylation signatures similar to those of cancers with low or intermediate levels of methylation, and the low-frequency methylation adenoma class had methylation signatures similar to that of nontumor colon tissue. The CpG sites that were differentially methylated in these signatures are located in intragenic and intergenic regions. CONCLUSIONS: Genome-wide alterations in DNA methylation occur during early stages of progression of tubular adenomas to cancer. These findings reveal heterogeneity in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer, even at the adenoma step of the process.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>147 (2), 418-29.e8</Feld596><PubVol>147</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>418</StrtPage><EndPage>29.e8</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Luo Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Wong CJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kaz AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Dzieciatkowski S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Carter KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Morris SM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Wang J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Willis JE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Makar KW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Ulrich CM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Lutterbaugh JD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Shrubsole MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Zheng W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Markowitz SD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Grady WM" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24793120</PMID><DOI>10.1053/j.gastro.2014.04.039</DOI><KST>G110</KST><KEYWORD>PHENOTYPE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LESIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHOGENESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>microsatellite instability</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HYPERMETHYLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN COLON</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POLYPS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CPG ISLAND METHYLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BRAF mutation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SERRATED PATHWAY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52370</publishedID><Artikel>Disialoganglioside GD3-synthase over expression inhibits survival and angiogenesis of pancreatic cancer cells through cell cycle arrest at S-phase and disruption of integrin-beta1-mediated anchorage</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Biochemistry and Cell Biology</Journal><ABSTr>Gangliosides play important roles in the development, differentiation and proliferation of mammalian cells. They bind to other cell membrane components through their terminal sialic acids. Different gangliosides influence cellular functions based on the positions and linkages of sialic acids. Expression of gangliosides mainly depends on the status of sialic acid-modulatory enzymes, such as different types of sialyltransferases and sialidases. One such sialyltransferase, disialoganglioside GD3 synthase, is specifically responsible for the production of GD3. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, making up more than 90% of pancreatic cancers, is a fatal malignancy with poor prognosis. Despite higher sialylation status, the disialoganglioside GD3 level is very low in this cancer. However, the exact status and function of this disialoganglioside is still unknown. Here, we intended to study the intracellular mechanism of disialoganglioside GD3-induced apoptosis and its correlation with the adhesion and angiogenic pathways in pancreatic cancer. We demonstrated that disialoganglioside GD3 synthase-transfected cells showed enhanced apoptosis and it caused the arrest of these cells in the S-phase of the cell cycle. Integrins, a family of transmembrane proteins play important role in cell-cell recognition, invasion, adhesion and migration. disialoganglioside GD3 co-localised with integrin-beta1 and thereby inhibited it's downstream signalling in transfected cells. Transfected cells exhibited inhibition of cell adhesion with extracellular matrix proteins. Enhanced GD3 expression down regulated angiogenesis-regulatory proteins and inhibited epidermal growth factor/vascular endothelial growth factor-driven angiogenic cell growth in these cells. Taken together, our study provides support for the GD3-induced cell cycle arrest, disruption of integrin-beta1-mediated anchorage, inhibition of angiogenesis and thereby induced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>53 (), 162-173</Feld596><PubVol>53</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>162</StrtPage><EndPage>173</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Mandal C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Sarkar S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Chatterjee U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schwartz-Albiez R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Mandal C" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24842107</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.biocel.2014.05.015</DOI><KST>D015</KST><KEYWORD>HUMAN T</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SIALATE-O-ACETYLTRANSFERASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ganglioside GD3</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ROLES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SIALIC ACIDS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LYMPHOCYTES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>acetylation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC-LEUKEMIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INDUCED APOPTOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATED PROTEIN-KINASE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52371</publishedID><Artikel>High-risk HPV types and head and neck cancer</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Although HPV16 has been strongly implicated in oropharyngeal carcinogenesis, the role of other high-risk HPV types in the etiology of head and neck cancer remains unclear. To date, few data exist addressing the nature of the association between antibodies to oncogenic proteins of non-HPV16 HPVs in relation to head and neck cancer. We examined the relationship between multiple HPV types (HPV6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, 58) and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in a large population-based case-control study (1069 cases and 1107 controls). Serological measures for HPV types included antibodies to L1, E6 and/or E7. In a secondary analysis, we excluded HPV16 seropositive subjects to examine independent associations with other high-risk HPVs. All analyses were adjusted for age, race, sex, education, smoking and alcohol consumption. Statistically significant associations were observed for HPV16, 18, 33 and 52 and risk of HNSCC after mutually adjusting for HPV types. Among HPV16 seronegative subjects, elevated risks of HNSCC were observed for HPV18 E6 (OR = 4.19, 95% CI = 1.26-14.0), HPV33 E6 (OR = 7.96, 95% CI = 1.56-40.5) and HPV52 E7 (OR = 3.40, 95% CI = 1.16-9.99). When examined by tumor type, associations with HPV18 and HPV33 remained statistically significant for oropharyngeal cancer, and HPV52 was associated with oral cancer. In addition, magnitude of associations for HNSCC increased markedly with increasing number of seropositive high-risk HPV infections. High-risk HPV types, other than HPV16, are likely to be involved in the etiology of HNSCC.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>135 (7), 1653-1661</Feld596><PubVol>135</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>1653</StrtPage><EndPage>1661</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Michaud DS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Langevin SM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Eliot M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Nelson HH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Pawlita M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="McClean MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Kelsey KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24615247</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28811</DOI><KST>F020</KST><KEYWORD>ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IDENTIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CERVICAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SQUAMOUS-CELL CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>UNITED-STATES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRENDS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ONCOPROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ORAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS INFECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MULTIPLE IMPUTATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52372</publishedID><Artikel>Reassessing cellular glutathione homoeostasis: novel insights revealed by genetically encoded redox probes</Artikel><Journal>Biochemical Society Transactions</Journal><ABSTr>Glutathione is the most abundant small molecule thiol in nearly all eukaryotes. Whole-cell levels of oxidized (GSSG) and reduced (GSH) glutathione are variable and responsive to genetic and chemical manipulations, which has led to their relative levels being widely used as a marker of the 'cellular redox state' and to indicate the level of 'oxidative stress' experienced by cells, tissues and organisms. However, the applicability of glutathione as a marker for a generalized 'cellular redox state' is questionable, especially in the light of recent observations in yeast cells. In yeast, whole-cell GSSG changes are almost completely dependent upon the activity of an ABC-C (ATP-binding cassette-C) transporter, Ycf1 (yeast cadmium factor 1), which mediates sequestration of GSSG to the vacuole. In the absence of Ycf1 whole-cell GSSG content is strongly decreased and extremely robust to perturbation. These observations are consistent with highly specific redox-sensitive GFP probe-based measurements of the cytosolic glutathione pool and indicate that cytosolic GSSG reductive systems are easily able to reduce nearly all GSSG formed, even following treatment with large concentrations of oxidant. In the present paper, I discuss the consequences of these new findings for our understanding of glutathione homoeostasis in the eukaryotic cell.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>42 (4), 979-984</Feld596><PubVol>42</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>979</StrtPage><EndPage>984</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Morgan B" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25109989</PMID><DOI>10.1042/BST20140101</DOI><KST>A160</KST><KEYWORD>ASTROCYTES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MITOCHONDRIAL INTERMEMBRANE SPACE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OXIDIZED GLUTATHIONE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OXIDATIVE STRESS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUPEROXIDE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEIN S-GLUTATHIONYLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISULFIDE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52373</publishedID><Artikel>Engineering light-inducible nuclear localization signals for precise spatiotemporal control of protein dynamics in living cells</Artikel><Journal>Nature Communications</Journal><ABSTr>The function of many eukaryotic proteins is regulated by highly dynamic changes in their nucleocytoplasmic distribution.

LINuS is a small, versatile tag, customizable for different proteins and cell types. LINuS-mediated nuclear import is fast and reversible, and can be tuned at different levels, for instance, by introducing mutations that alter AsLOV2 domain photo-caging properties or by selecting nuclear localization signals (NLSs) of various strengths. We demonstrate the utility of LINuS in mammalian cells by controlling gene expression and entry into mitosis with blue light.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>5 (), 4404-</Feld596><PubVol>5</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>4404</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Niopek D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Benzinger D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Roensch J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Draebing T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Wehler P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Eils R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Di Ventura B" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25019686</PMID><DOI>10.1038/ncomms5404</DOI><KST>B080</KST><KEYWORD>DOMAIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SEQUENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BIOLOGY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SYSTEM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>p53</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>YEAST</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52374</publishedID><Artikel>Plasma methionine, choline, betaine, and dimethylglycine in relation to colorectal cancer risk in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)</Artikel><Journal>Annals of Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Disturbances in one carbon metabolism may contribute to carcinogenesis by affecting methylation and synthesis of DNA. Choline and its oxidation product betaine are involved in this metabolism and can serve as alternative methyl group donors when folate status is low. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a case-control study nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), to investigate plasma concentrations of the methyl donors methionine, choline, betaine (trimethylglycine), and dimethylglycine (DMG) in relation to colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. Our study included 1367 incident CRC cases (965 colon and 402 rectum) and 2323 controls matched by gender, age group, and study center. Multivariate-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for CRC risk were estimated by conditional logistic regression, comparing the fifth to the first quintile of plasma concentrations. RESULTS: Overall, methionine (OR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.63-0.99, P-trend = 0.05), choline (OR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.60-0.99, P-trend = 0.07), and betaine (OR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.66-1.09, P-trend = 0.06) concentrations were inversely associated with CRC risk of borderline significance. In participants with folate concentration below the median of 11.3 nmol/l, high betaine concentration was associated with reduced CRC risk (OR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.50-1.00, P-trend = 0.02), which was not observed for those having a higher folate status. Among women, but not men, high choline concentration was associated with decreased CRC risk (OR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.43-0.88, P-trend = 0.01). Plasma DMG was not associated with CRC risk. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with high plasma concentrations of methionine, choline, and betaine may be at reduced risk of CRC.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>25 (8), 1609-1615</Feld596><PubVol>25</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>1609</StrtPage><EndPage>1615</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Nitter M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Norgard B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="de Vogel S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Eussen SJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Meyer K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Ulvik A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Ueland PM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Nygard O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Vollset SE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Bjorge T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Hansen L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Boutron-Ruault M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Racine A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Cottet V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Kaaks R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="16" name="Kuehn T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="17" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Bamia C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Naska A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Grioni S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Palli D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Panico S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Vineis P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="van Kranen H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Peeters PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Dorronsoro M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Jakszyn P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Sanchez M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Arguelles M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Huerta JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Barricarte A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Johansson M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Ljuslinder I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Khaw K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Wareham N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Freisling H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Duarte-Salles T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Stepien M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Gunter MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24827130</PMID><DOI>10.1093/annonc/mdu185</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>HEALTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WOMEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REQUIREMENTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPIDEMIOLOGY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ESTROGEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ONE-CARBON METABOLISM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>B-vitamin</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FOLATE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENETIC-VARIANTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIETARY CHOLINE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52375</publishedID><Artikel>Hypoxia as a biomarker for radioresistant cancer stem cells</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Radiation Biology</Journal><ABSTr>Abstract Background: Tumor initiation, growth and relapse after therapy are thought to be driven by a population of cells with stem cell characteristics, named cancer stem cells (CSC). The regulation of their radiation resistance and their maintenance is poorly understood. CSC are believed to reside preferentially in special microenvironmental niches located within tumor tissues. The features of these niches are of crucial importance for CSC self-renewal, metastatic potential and therapy resistance. One of the characteristics of solid tumors is occurrence of less oxygenated (hypoxic regions), which are believed to serve as so-called hypoxic niches for CSC. PURPOSE: The purpose of this review was the critical discussion of the supportive role of hypoxia and hypoxia-related pathways during cancer progression and radiotherapy resistance and the relevance for therapeutic implications in the clinic. CONCLUSION: It is generally known since decades that hypoxia inside solid tumors impedes chemo- and radiotherapy. However, there is limited evidence to date that targeting hypoxic regions during conventional therapy is effective. Nonetheless improved hypoxia-imaging technologies and image guided individualized hypoxia targeted therapy in conjunction with the development of novel molecular targets may be able to challenge the protective effect on the tumor provided by hypoxia.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>90 (8), 636-652</Feld596><PubVol>90</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>636</StrtPage><EndPage>652</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Peitzsch C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Perrin R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Hill RP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Dubrovska A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kurth I" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24844374</PMID><DOI>10.3109/09553002.2014.916841</DOI><KST>L301</KST><KEYWORD>INDUCIBLE FACTOR-I</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEMATOPOIETIC-STEM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR HYPOXIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPITHELIAL-MESENCHYMAL TRANSITIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SOLID TUMORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NECK-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATED PROTEIN-KINASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NF-KAPPA-B</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH-FACTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52377</publishedID><Artikel>Direct acute tubular damage contributes to Shigatoxin-mediated kidney failure</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Pathology</Journal><ABSTr>The pathogenesis and therapy of Shigatoxin 2 (Stx2)-mediated kidney failure remain controversial. Our aim was to test whether, during an infection with Stx2-producing E. coli (STEC), Stx2 exerts direct effects on renal tubular epithelium and thereby possibly contributes to acute renal failure. Mice represent a suitable model because they, like humans, express the Stx2-receptor Gb3 in the tubular epithelium but, in contrast to humans, not in glomerular endothelia, and are thus free of glomerular thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). In wild-type mice, Stx2 caused acute tubular dysfunction with consequent electrolyte disturbance, which was most likely the cause of death. Tubule-specific depletion of Gb3 protected the mice from acute renal failure. In vitro, Stx2 induced secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and apoptosis in human tubular epithelial cells, thus implicating a direct effect of Stx2 on the tubular epithelium. To correlate these results to human disease, kidney biopsies and outcome were analysed in patients with Stx2-associated kidney failure (n = 11, aged 22-44 years). The majority of kidney biopsies showed different stages of an ongoing TMA; however, no glomerular complement activation could be demonstrated. All biopsies, including those without TMA, showed severe acute tubular damage. Due to these findings, patients were treated with supportive therapy without complement-inhibiting antibodies (eculizumab) or immunoadsorption. Despite the severity of the initial disease [creatinine 6.34 (1.31-17.60) mg/dl, lactate dehydrogenase 1944 (753-2792) U/l, platelets 33 (19-124)/nl and haemoglobin 6.2 (5.2-7.8) g/dl; median (range)], all patients were discharged after 33 (range 19-43) days with no neurological symptoms and no dialysis requirement [creatinine 1.39 (range 0.84-2.86) mg/dl]. The creatinine decreased further to 0.90 (range 0.66-1.27) mg/dl after 24 months. Based on these data, one may surmise that acute tubular damage represents a separate pathophysiological mechanism, importantly contributing to Stx2-mediated acute kidney failure. Specifically in young adults, an excellent outcome can be achieved by supportive therapy only. (c) 2014 The Authors.

Twenty-seven and 38 patients received AZA and LD-Ara-C, respectively. The median patient age was 71 yr. Patient and disease characteristics did not differ between the treatment groups, except for BM blast counts, and peripheral leukocyte and blast counts which were significantly higher in the LD-Ara-C group. AZA and LD-Ara-C were first-line treatment in 12 (44%) and 17 patients (45%), respectively. Response and hematologic improvement rates were low and similar in both treatment groups. In both treatment groups, most common non-hematologic toxicities included febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, and bleedings without significant differences regarding frequencies. Estimated 1-yr survival rates were 15% (95% CI 8-22) and 13% (95% CI 7-19) in the AZA and LD-Ara-C groups, respectively, without statistically significant difference. In multivariate analysis (n = 65), previous treatment (HR 2.27, 95% CI 1.00-5.22, P = 0.05) and adverse cytogenetics (HR 2.50, 95% CI 1.20-5.22, P = 0.02) were independent predictors of poor survival. In our center and within the limitations of a retrospective study, both treatment regimens showed similar but limited efficacy in palliative patients with AML and high BM blast counts.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>93 (2), 112-117</Feld596><PubVol>93</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>112</StrtPage><EndPage>117</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Radujkovic A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Dietrich S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bochtler T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kraemer A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schoening T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Ho AD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Dreger P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Luft T" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24628527</PMID><DOI>10.1111/ejh.12308</DOI><KST>G330</KST><KEYWORD>AML PATIENTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTERNATIONAL WORKING GROUP</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ARA-C</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONVENTIONAL CARE REGIMENS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RESPONSE CRITERIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTENSIVE CHEMOTHERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OLDER PATIENTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHASE-III</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AGE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52379</publishedID><Artikel>Molecular characterization of long-term survivors of glioblastoma using genome- and transcriptome-wide profiling</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>The prognosis of glioblastoma, the most malignant type of glioma, is still poor, with only a minority of patients showing long-term survival of more than three years after diagnosis. To elucidate the molecular aberrations in glioblastomas of long-term survivors, we performed genome- and/or transcriptome-wide molecular profiling of glioblastoma samples from 94 patients, including 28 long-term survivors with &gt;36 months overall survival (OS), 20 short-term survivors with &lt;12 months OS and 46 patients with intermediate OS. Integrative bioinformatic analyses were used to characterize molecular aberrations in the distinct survival groups considering established molecular markers such as isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 or 2 (IDH1/2) mutations, and O(6) -methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation. Patients with long-term survival were younger and more often had IDH1/2-mutant and MGMT-methylated tumors. Gene expression profiling revealed over-representation of a distinct (proneural-like) expression signature in long-term survivors that was linked to IDH1/2 mutation. However, IDH1/2-wildtype glioblastomas from long-term survivors did not show distinct gene expression profiles and included proneural, classical and mesenchymal glioblastoma subtypes. Genomic imbalances also differed between IDH1/2-mutant and IDH1/2-wildtype tumors, but not between survival groups of IDH1/2-wildtype patients. Thus, our data support an important role for MGMT promoter methylation and IDH1/2 mutation in glioblastoma long-term survival and corroborate the association of IDH1/2 mutation with distinct genomic and transcriptional profiles. Importantly, however, IDH1/2-wildtype glioblastomas in our cohort of long-term survivors lacked distinctive DNA copy number changes and gene expression signatures, indicating that other factors might have been responsible for long survival in this particular subgroup of patients.(c) 2014 UICC.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>135 (8), 1822-1831</Feld596><PubVol>135</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>1822</StrtPage><EndPage>1831</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Reifenberger G" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Weber RG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Riehmer V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kaulich K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Willscher E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Wirth H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Gietzelt J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Hentschel B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Westphal M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Simon M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Schackert G" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Schramm J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Matschke J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Sabel MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Gramatzki D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Felsberg J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="16" name="Hartmann C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="17" name="Steinbach JP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="18" name="Schlegel U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Wick W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="20" name="Radlwimmer B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="21" name="Pietsch T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Tonn JC" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="23" name="von Deimling A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="24" name="Binder H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Weller M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="26" name="Loeffler M" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24615357</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28836</DOI><KST>B060</KST><KST>G380</KST><KST>G370</KST><KST>L301</KST><KST>L401</KST><KST>L501</KST><KST>L701</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>UNITED-STATES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HYBRIDIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>brain</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MULTIFORME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLIOMAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>temozolomide</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IDH2 MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CODON 132 MUTATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52380</publishedID><Artikel>Wnt-Fzd signaling sensitizes peripheral sensory neurons via distinct noncanonical pathways</Artikel><Journal>Neuron</Journal><ABSTr>Wnt signaling represents a highly versatile signaling system, which plays diverse and critical roles in various aspects of neural development. Sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia require Wnt signaling for initial cell-fate determination as well as patterning and synapse formation. Here we report that Wnt signaling pathways persist in adult sensory neurons and play a functional role in their sensitization in a pathophysiological context. We observed that Wnt3a recruits the Wnt-calcium signaling pathway and the Wnt planar cell polarity pathway in peripheral nerves to alter pain sensitivity in a modality-specific manner and we elucidated underlying mechanisms. In contrast, biochemical, pharmacological, and genetic studies revealed lack of functional relevance for the classical canonical beta-catenin pathway in peripheral sensory neurons in acute modulation of nociception. Finally, this study provides proof-of-concept for a translational potential for Wnt3a-Frizzled3 signaling in alleviating disease-related pain hypersensitivity in cancer-associated pain in vivo.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>83 (1), 104-121</Feld596><PubVol>83</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>104</StrtPage><EndPage>121</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Simonetti M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Agarwal N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Stosser S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Bali KK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Karaulanov E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Kamble R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Pospisilova B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Kurejova M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Birchmeier W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Niehrs C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Heppenstall P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Kuner R" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24991956</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.neuron.2014.05.037</DOI><KST>A050</KST><KEYWORD>CATENIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>mechanisms</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECEPTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BEHAVIOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHOGENESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONDITIONAL GENE DELETION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BONE CANCER PAIN</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52381</publishedID><Artikel>Cancer stem cell characteristics of circulating tumor cells</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Radiation Biology</Journal><ABSTr>Abstract Purpose: To review the results from previous studies aiming at the molecular characterization of circulating tumor cells (CTC), to specifically address the role of epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) and stemness features of CTC in their contribution to tumor progression and to summarize potential interference of CTC with the efficacy of radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of CTC has been reported for most epithelial tumors and has been associated with an increased risk of local and regional recurrence as well as the development of distant metastases. Given a causal relationship between the presence of CTC and tumor progression at the primary or distant sites, several distinct features have to be postulated for these cells: First, a change from an epithelial to a mesenchymal cell-like phenotype which should alleviate the disconnection of individual tumor cells from tight cell-to-cell junctions within the epithelial cell layer and endow single tumor cells with the capacity to migrate into blood vessels; secondly, the presence of stem-cell properties which contribute to the re-establishment of bulk tumor tissue at the primary or metastatic site upon tumor recurrence or distant progression, respectively. Indeed, EMT and stem-cell features were frequently observed in CTC and the phenotype of CTC was established as a stronger predictor of outcome than sole enumeration of CTC in a defined volume of blood. The exploitation of CTC above their use as prognostic marker is still a subject of many ongoing investigations as are the identification of suitable therapeutic targets for this small cell subpopulation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>90 (8), 622-627</Feld596><PubVol>90</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>622</StrtPage><EndPage>627</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Tinhofer I" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Saki M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Niehr F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Keilholz U" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Budach V" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24460132</PMID><DOI>10.3109/09553002.2014.886798</DOI><KST>L201</KST><KEYWORD>EPITHELIAL-MESENCHYMAL-TRANSITION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROSTATE-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RADIATION-THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BONE-MARROW</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGNOSTIC VALUE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LUNG-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>liver metastasis</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METASTATIC BREAST-CANCER</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52382</publishedID><Artikel>American association for cancer research - AACR congress 2014</Artikel><Journal>Oncologie</Journal><ABSTr>This year the American association for cancer research meeting was held in San Diego.

This year was undoubtedly the year of immunotherapy and immunology of tumors. With the aim of sharing the data presented at this congress, AERIO (Association d'Enseignement et de Recherche des Internes d'Oncologie) and Oncologie joined to propose a digest of this outstanding congress. Of course, exhaustivity is not an objective of this type of digest which reflects the choices of young researchers and physicians, with the help of the editorial board, among the multiple themes and researches presented and discussed during this meeting. Tumor immunology and immunotherapy data from the congress are reported. Moreover, autophagy, microbiome, liquid biopsy, tumoral heterogeneity, and cancer stem cells data from this congress are reported, as a reflection of the diversity of this meeting and cancer research. From a clinical point of view, new targets and molecules and the new design of clinical trial are also reported.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>16 (7-8), 341-366</Feld596><PubVol>16</PubVol><PubIss>7-8</PubIss><StrtPage>341</StrtPage><EndPage>366</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Vaccheli,E."

In particular, members of the protein tyrosine phosphatase family are known to undergo reversible oxidation of their active site cysteine. The thiol oxidation step requires activation of colocalized NADPH oxidases and is mediated by locally produced reactive oxygen species, in particular H2 O2 . How oxidized phosphatases are returned to the reduced active state is less well studied. Both major thiol reductive systems, the thioredoxin and the glutathione systems, have been implicated in the reactivation of phosphatases. Here, we show that the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B and the dual-specificity phosphatase PTEN are preferentially reactivated by the thioredoxin system. We show that inducible depletion of thioredoxin 1(TRX1) slows PTEN reactivation in intact living cells. Finally, using a mechanism-based trapping approach, we demonstrate direct thiol disulphide exchange between the active sites of thioredoxin and either phosphatase. The application of thioredoxin trapping mutants represents a complementary approach to direct assays of PTP oxidation in elucidating the significance of redox regulation of PTP function in the control of cell signaling.

Using a GFP reporter driven by the promoter of the nuclear receptor tailless (Tlx), we demonstrate that Tlx(+) cells in primary brain tumors are mostly quiescent. Lineage tracing demonstrates that single Tlx(+) cells can self-renew and generate Tlx(-) tumor cells in primary tumors, suggesting that they are brain tumor stem cells (BTSCs). After introducing a BTSC-specific knock-out of the Tlx gene in primary mouse tumors, we observed a loss of self-renewal of BTSCs and prolongation of animal survival, accompanied by induction of essential signaling pathways mediating cell-cycle arrest, cell death, and neural differentiation. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of targeting glioblastomas and indicates the suitability of BTSCs as therapeutic targets, thereby supporting the CSC hypothesis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>15 (2), 185-198</Feld596><PubVol>15</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>185</StrtPage><EndPage>198</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Zhu Z" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Khan MA" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Weiler M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Blaes J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Jestaedt L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Geibert M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Zou P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Gronych J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Bernhardt O" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Korshunov A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Bugner V" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Lichter P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Radlwimmer B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Heiland S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Bendszus M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Wick W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="16" name="Liu HK*" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="17" name="(* corresponding author" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Highlighted in Nature Reviews Cancer: cancer stem cell knockout" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="highlighted in Cell Stem Cell" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name=": The tailless root of glioma: cancer stem cells)" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24835569</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.stem.2014.04.007</DOI><KST>B060</KST><KST>G380</KST><KST>G370</KST><KST>A240</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>GLIOMAGENESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>transcription</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IDENTIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLIOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOUSE MODELS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TLX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NUCLEAR RECEPTOR TAILLESS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52442</publishedID><Artikel>Long Noncoding RNA TARID Directs Demethylation and Activation of the Tumor Suppressor TCF21 via GADD45A</Artikel><Journal>Molecular Cell</Journal><ABSTr>DNA methylation is a dynamic and reversible process that governs gene expression during development and disease. Several examples of active DNA demethylation have been documented, involving genome-wide and gene-specific DNA demethylation. How demethylating enzymes are targeted to specific genomic loci remains largely unknown. We show that an antisense lncRNA, termed TARID (for TCF21 antisense RNA inducing demethylation), activates TCF21 expression by inducing promoter demethylation. TARID interacts with both the TCF21 promoter and GADD45A (growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible, alpha), a regulator of DNA demethylation. GADD45A in turn recruits thymine-DNA glycosylase for base excision repair-mediated demethylation involving oxidation of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in the TCF21 promoter by ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase proteins. The results reveal a function of lncRNAs, serving as a genomic address label for GADD45A-mediated demethylation of specific target genes.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>55 (4), 604-614</Feld596><PubVol>55</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>604</StrtPage><EndPage>614</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Arab K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Park YJ" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Lindroth AM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schaefer A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Oakes C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Weichenhan D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Lukanova A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Lundin E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Risch A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Meister M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Dienemann H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Dyckhoff G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Herold-Mende C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Grummt I" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="14" name="Niehrs C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Plass C" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25087872</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.molcel.2014.06.031</DOI><KST>C010</KST><KST>A050</KST><KST>A030</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>TET PROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLYCOSYLASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>5-HYDROXYMETHYLCYTOSINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MAMMALIAN DNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVE DNA DEMETHYLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>5-methylcytosine</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXCISION-REPAIR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROMOTER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METHYLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LUNG</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52443</publishedID><Artikel>COX2 expression in neuroblastoma increases tumorigenicity but does not affect cell death in response to the COX2 inhibitor celecoxib</Artikel><Journal>Clinical and Experimental Metastasis</Journal><ABSTr>COX2 is an inducible cyclooxygenase implicated in the metastasis and migration of tumour cells. In neuroblastoma, COX2 expression has been detected in both cell lines and tumours. The treatment of neuroblastoma cells in vitro with celecoxib, a COX2 inhibitor, induces apoptosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of COX2 in neuroblastoma tumour biology by creating a cell line in which COX2 could be conditionally expressed. Xenograft studies showed that the conditional expression of COX2 enhanced tumour growth and malignancy. Elevated COX2 expression enhanced the proliferation and migration of neuroblastoma cells in vitro. However, elevated COX2 expression or variation between cell lines did not affect sensitivity to the COX2 inhibitor celecoxib, indicating that celecoxib does not promote cell death through COX2 inhibition. These data show that increased COX2 expression alone can enhance the tumorigenic properties of neuroblastoma cells; however, high levels of COX2 may not be a valid biomarker of sensitivity to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as celecoxib.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>31 (6), 651-659</Feld596><PubVol>31</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>651</StrtPage><EndPage>659</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Bell E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Ponthan F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Whitworth C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Tweddle DA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Lunec J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Redfern CP" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24859418</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s10585-014-9656-3</DOI><KST>B087</KST><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>APOPTOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LINES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INVOLVEMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CYCLOOXYGENASE-2</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BONE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BREAST-CANCER METASTASIS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52444</publishedID><Artikel>Assessing Treatment Response of Osteolytic Lesions by Manual Volumetry, Automatic Segmentation, and RECIST in Experimental Bone Metastases</Artikel><Journal>Academic Radiology</Journal><ABSTr>RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Aim of the study was to compare between volumetric and unidimensional approaches for treatment response monitoring in a nude rat model of experimental bone metastases. For the volumetric approach, an automated segmentation algorithm of osteolytic lesions was introduced and compared to manual volumetry. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Nude rats bearing osteolytic metastases were treated with zoledronate and sunitinib and compared to controls. Treatment response was assessed longitudinally in vivo using flat-panel volumetric computed tomography at days 30, 35, 45, and 55 after tumor cell inoculation. The mean sizes and volumes of osteolytic lesions were determined according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) and by automated and manual volumetry (software: MITK [The Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit, Heidelberg, Germany] and VIRTUOS, Heidelberg, Germany). RESULTS: In contrary to RECIST, the manual volumetric approach indicated a significant decrease in osteolytic lesion volume in response to treatment. The presented automatic segmentation algorithm for treatment monitoring identified bone metastases adequately and assessed changes in the osteolytic lesion volume over time according to manual volumetry. CONCLUSIONS: In an animal model, volumetric treatment response assessment of osteolytic bone metastases is superior to unidimensional measurements, and automated volumetric segmentation may be a valuable alternative to manual volume determination.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>21 (9), 1177-1184</Feld596><PubVol>21</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>1177</StrtPage><EndPage>1184</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Bretschi M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Fraenzle A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Merz M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Hillengass J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Semmler W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Bendl R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Baeuerle T" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24998693</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.acra.2014.04.011</DOI><KST>E020</KST><KST>E040</KST><KST>E013</KST><KEYWORD>TUMOR RESPONSE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RAT MODEL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTEROBSERVER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CRITERIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHASE-II</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SOLID TUMORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VARIABILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACCURACY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CT</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52445</publishedID><Artikel>Lack of CD24 expression in mice reduces the number of leukocytes in the colon</Artikel><Journal>Immunology Letters</Journal><ABSTr>CD24 is an extensively glycosylated membrane protein that is linked to the membrane via a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor. In mice, CD24 is expressed by hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells. CD24-/- mice do not have gross immunological defects, but detailed analysis revealed strongly reduced responses in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model and a massive proliferation of T cells under lymphopenic conditions. It was also demonstrated that preB cells from CD24-/- mice are impaired in alpha4-integrin-mediated cell binding. Here we report that CD24-/- mice have strongly reduced numbers of leukocytes in the colon compared to wildtype mice. The reduction comprized all subpopulations. Leukocyte counts in spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes or small intestine were not significantly different. We find that beside leukocytes, CD24 is widely expressed in EpCAM+ epithelial and CD31+ endothelial cells of colon and small intestine. However, in CD24-/- mice the number of CD31+ endothelial cells in colons was strongly reduced and the number of epithelial cells was augmented. Leukocyte transfer experiments provided evidence that the CD24 status of recipient mice, rather than of the transferred cells, is crucial for leukocyte recruitment to the colon. We hypothesize that CD24 on colonic epithelial and endothelial cells is required for the retention and positioning of leukocytes most likely by affecting integrin function.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>161 (1), 140-148</Feld596><PubVol>161</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>140</StrtPage><EndPage>148</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Bretz NP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Salnikov AV" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Doberstein K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Garbi N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kloess V" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Joumaa S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Naumov I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Boon L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Moldenhauer G" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Arber N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Altevogt P" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24956310</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.imlet.2014.06.004</DOI><KST>D015</KST><KEYWORD>T-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>P-SELECTIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PRECURSORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AUTOIMMUNE-DISEASES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEAT-STABLE ANTIGEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>B-LYMPHOCYTES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COSTIMULATORY MOLECULE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52446</publishedID><Artikel>European Federation of Organisations for Medical Physics (EFOMP) Policy Statement 12.1: Recommendations on Medical Physics Education and Training in Europe 2014</Artikel><Journal>Physica Medica : European Journal of Medical Physics</Journal><ABSTr>In 2010, EFOMP issued Policy Statement No. 12: "The present status of Medical Physics Education and Training in Europe. New perspectives and EFOMP recommendations" to be applied to education and training in Medical Physics within the context of the developments in the European Higher Education Area arising from the Bologna Declaration and with a view to facilitate the free movement of Medical Physics professionals within Europe. Concurrently, new recommendations regarding qualifications frameworks were published by the European Parliament and Council which introduced new terminology and a new qualifications framework - the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) for lifelong learning. In addition, a new European directive involving the medical use of ionizing radiations and set to replace previous directives in this area was in the process of development. This has now been realized as Council Directive 2013/59/Euratom of 5 December 2013 which has repealed directive 97/43/Euratom. In this regard, a new document was developed in the context of the EC financed project "European Guidelines on the Medical Physics Expert" and published as RP174. Among other items, these guidelines refer to the mission statement, key activities, qualification framework and curricula for the specialty areas of Medical Physics relating to radiological devices and protection from ionizing radiation. These developments have made necessary an update of PS12; this policy statement provides the necessary update.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>30 (6), 598-603</Feld596><PubVol>30</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>598</StrtPage><EndPage>603</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Caruana CJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Christofides S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Hartmann GH" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24954923</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.ejmp.2014.06.001</DOI><KST>E040</KST></row><row><publishedID>52448</publishedID><Artikel>PCNA and Msh2-Msh6 activate an Mlh1-Pms1 endonuclease pathway required for Exo1-independent mismatch repair</Artikel><Journal>Molecular Cell</Journal><ABSTr>Genetic evidence has implicated multiple pathways in eukaryotic DNA mismatch repair (MMR) downstream of mispair recognition and Mlh1-Pms1 recruitment, including Exonuclease 1 (Exo1)-dependent and -independent pathways. We identified 14 mutations in POL30, which encodes PCNA in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, specific to Exo1-independent MMR. The mutations identified affected amino acids at three distinct sites on the PCNA structure. Multiple mutant PCNA proteins had defects either in trimerization and Msh2-Msh6 binding or in activation of the Mlh1-Pms1 endonuclease that initiates excision during MMR. The latter class of mutations led to hyperaccumulation of repair intermediate Mlh1-Pms1 foci and were enhanced by an msh6 mutation that disrupted the Msh2-Msh6 interaction with PCNA. These results reveal a central role for PCNA in the Exo1-independent MMR pathway and suggest that Msh2-Msh6 localizes PCNA to repair sites after mispair recognition to activate the Mlh1-Pms1 endonuclease for initiating Exo1-dependent repair or for driving progressive excision in Exo1-independent repair.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>55 (2), 291-304</Feld596><PubVol>55</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>291</StrtPage><EndPage>304</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Goellner EM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Smith CE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Campbell CS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Hombauer H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Desai A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Putnam CD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Kolodner RD" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24981171</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.molcel.2014.04.034</DOI><KST>A310</KST><KEYWORD>C-TERMINAL DOMAIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL NUCLEAR ANTIGEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NONPOLYPOSIS COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VITRO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE EXO1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA-POLYMERASE-DELTA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FUNCTIONAL INTERACTIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXONUCLEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTL-ALPHA ENDONUCLEASE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52449</publishedID><Artikel>Human chimera-type galectin-3: defining the critical tail length for high-affinity glycoprotein/cell surface binding and functional competition with galectin-1 in neuroblastoma cell growth regulation</Artikel><Journal>Biochimie</Journal><ABSTr>Many human proteins have a modular design with receptor and structural domains.

Genetic engineering with sophisticated mass spectrometric product analysis provided the tools for biotesting, i.e. eight protein variants with different degrees of tail truncation. Evidently,various aspects of galectin-3 activity (cis binding and cell bridging) are affected by tail shortening in a different manner. Thus, this combined approach reveals an unsuspected complexity of structure-function relationship, encouraging further application beyond this chimera-type galectin.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>104 (), 90-99</Feld596><PubVol>104</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>90</StrtPage><EndPage>99</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kopitz J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Vertesy S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Andre S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Fiedler S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schnoelzer M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Gabius HJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24909114</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.biochi.2014.05.010</DOI><KST>B100</KST><KST>G105</KST><KEYWORD>PANCREATIC-CARCINOMA MODEL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SELF-ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DOWN-REGULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NUCLEAR-LOCALIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CARBOHYDRATE-RECOGNITION DOMAIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>fetuin</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANIMAL LECTINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUGAR CODE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUBSTRATE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52450</publishedID><Artikel>Tumour-induced immune suppression: role of inflammatory mediators released by myelomonocytic cells</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Internal Medicine</Journal><ABSTr>Tumour-induced immune dysfunction is a serious challenge to immunotherapy for cancer, and intact adaptive and innate cellular immunity is key to its success. Myelomonocytic cells have a central role in this immune suppression, and tumour-associated macrophages, eosinophils, neutrophils and myeloid-derived suppressor cells have all been shown to be of major importance. These myelomonocytic cells secrete a broad repertoire of inflammatory mediators providing them with powerful tools to inhibit tumour-reactive T cells and natural killer cells; free oxygen radicals including reactive oxygen species and NO, arginase, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, prostaglandins, the pro-inflammatory heterodimer S100A8/9 and cytokines, such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and transforming growth factor-beta, have proven particularly potent in suppressing antitumour cellular immunity. Determining which of these factors prevail in individual cancer patients and designing methods aimed at neutralization or inhibition of their effects on target tissues have the potential to greatly enhance the clinical efficacy of immunotherapy.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>276 (2), 154-170</Feld596><PubVol>276</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>154</StrtPage><EndPage>170</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Mao Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Poschke I" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kiessling R" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24597954</PMID><DOI>10.1111/joim.12229</DOI><KST>G180</KST><KEYWORD>REGULATORY T-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADVANCED COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLONY-STIMULATING FACTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GM-CSF</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NATURAL-KILLER-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NITRIC-OXIDE SYNTHASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROINFLAMMATORY S100 PROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TERM DIETARY SUPPLEMENTATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LOW-DOSE RADIOTHERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CSF GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52451</publishedID><Artikel>A pro-inflammatory signalome is constitutively activated by C33Y mutant TNF receptor 1 in TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS)</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Immunology</Journal><ABSTr>Mutations in TNFRSF1A encoding TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) cause the autosomal dominant TNF receptor-associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS): a systemic autoinflammatory disorder. Misfolding, intracellular aggregation, and ligand-independent signaling by mutant TNFR1 are central to disease pathophysiology. Our aim was to understand the extent of signaling pathway perturbation in TRAPS. A prototypic mutant TNFR1 (C33Y), and wild-type TNFR1 (WT), were expressed at near physiological levels in an SK-Hep-1 cell model. TNFR1-associated signaling pathway intermediates were examined in this model, and in PBMCs from C33Y TRAPS patients and healthy controls. In C33Y-TNFR1-expressing SK-Hep-1 cells and TRAPS patients' PBMCs, a subtle, constitutive upregulation of a wide spectrum of signaling intermediates and their phosphorylated forms was observed; these were associated with a proinflammatory/antiapoptotic phenotype. In TRAPS patients' PBMCs, this upregulation of proinflammatory signaling pathways was observed irrespective of concurrent treatment with glucocorticoids, anakinra or etanercept, and the absence of overt clinical symptoms at the time that the blood samples were taken. This study reveals the pleiotropic effect of a TRAPS-associated mutant form of TNFR1 on inflammatory signaling pathways (a proinflammatory signalome), which is consistent with the variable and limited efficacy of cytokine-blocking therapies in TRAPS. It highlights new potential target pathways for therapeutic intervention.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>44 (7), 2096-2110</Feld596><PubVol>44</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>2096</StrtPage><EndPage>2110</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Negm OH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Mannsperger HA" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="McDermott EM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Drewe E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Powell RJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Todd I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Fairclough LC*" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Tighe PJ*" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="(∗These authors contributed equally to this work)" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24668260</PMID><DOI>10.1002/eji.201344328</DOI><KST>B050</KST><KEYWORD>FEVER SYNDROME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NF-KAPPA-B</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR-NECROSIS-FACTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>transcription</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>compartmentalization</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WILD-TYPE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURFACE EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTERLEUKIN-6</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>JNK ACTIVATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52454</publishedID><Artikel>Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with concurrent chemotherapy as definitive treatment of locally advanced esophageal cancer</Artikel><Journal>Radiation Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: To report our experience with increased dose intensity-modulated radiation and concurrent systemic chemotherapy as definitive treatment of locally advanced esophageal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 27 consecutive patients with histologically proven esophageal cancer, who were treated with increased-dose IMRT as part of their definitive therapy. The majority of patients had T3/4 and/or N1 disease (93%). Squamous cell carcinoma was the dominating histology (81%). IMRT was delivered in step-and-shoot technique in all patients using an integrated boost concept. The boost volume was covered with total doses of 56-60 Gy (single dose 2-2.14 Gy), while regional nodal regions received 50.4 Gy (single dose 1.8 Gy) in 28 fractions. Concurrent systemic therapy was scheduled in all patients and administered in 26 (96%). 17 patients received additional adjuvant systemic therapy. Loco-regional control, progression-free and overall survival as well as acute and late toxicities were retrospectively analyzed. In addition, quality of life was prospectively assessed according to the EORTC QLQs (QLQ-OG25, QLQ-H&amp;N35 and QLQ-C30). RESULTS: Radiotherapy was completed as planned in all but one patient (96%), and 21 patients received more than 80% of the planned concurrent systemic therapy. We observed ten locoregional failures, transferring into actuarial 1-, 2- and 3-year-locoregional control rates of 77%, 65% and 48%. Seven patients developed distant metastases, mainly to the lung (71%). The actuarial 1-, 2- and 3-year-disease free survival rates were 58%, 48% and 36%, and overall survival rates were 82%, 61% and 56%. The concept was well tolerated, both in the clinical objective examination and also according to the subjective answers to the QLQ questionnaire. 14 patients (52%) suffered from at least one acute CTC grade 3/4 toxicity, mostly hematological side effects or dysphagia. Severe late toxicities were reported in 6 patients (22%), mostly esophageal strictures and ulcerations. Severe side effects to skin, lung and heart were rare. CONCLUSION: IMRT with concurrent systemic therapy in the definitive treatment of esophageal cancer using an integrated boost concept with doses up to 60 Gy is feasible and yields good results with acceptable acute and late overall toxicity and low side effects to skin, lung and heart.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (), 191-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>191</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Roeder F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Nicolay NH" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Nguyen T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Saleh-Ebrahimi L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Askoxylakis V" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Bostel T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Zwicker F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Debus J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Timke C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Huber PE" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25175056</PMID><DOI>10.1186/1748-717X-9-191</DOI><KST>E050</KST><KST>E055</KST><KEYWORD>3D conformal radiotherapy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>chemoradiation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RADIATION-THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RANDOMIZED-TRIAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SQUAMOUS-CELL CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>adenocarcinoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURGERY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEOADJUVANT CHEMORADIOTHERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DOSE RADIATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52455</publishedID><Artikel>Initiation of an inflammatory response in resident intestinal lamina propria cells -use of a human organ culture model</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>Resident human lamina propria immune cells serve as powerful effectors in host defense. Molecular events associated with the initiation of an intestinal inflammatory response in these cells are largely unknown. Here, we aimed to characterize phenotypic and functional changes induced in these cells at the onset of intestinal inflammation using a human intestinal organ culture model. In this model, healthy human colonic mucosa was depleted of epithelial cells by EDTA treatment. Following loss of the epithelial layer, expression of the inflammatory mediators IL1B, IL6, IL8, IL23A, TNFA, CXCL2, and the surface receptors CD14, TLR2, CD86, CD54 was rapidly induced in resident lamina propria cells in situ as determined by qRT-PCR and immunohistology. Gene microarray analysis of lamina propria cells obtained by laser-capture microdissection provided an overview of global changes in gene expression occurring during the initiation of an intestinal inflammatory response in these cells. Bioinformatic analysis gave insight into signalling pathways mediating this inflammatory response. Furthermore, comparison with published microarray datasets of inflamed mucosa in vivo (ulcerative colitis) revealed a significant overlap of differentially regulated genes underlining the in vivo relevance of the organ culture model. Furthermore, genes never been previously associated with intestinal inflammation were identified using this model. The organ culture model characterized may be useful to study molecular mechanisms underlying the initiation of an intestinal inflammatory response in normal mucosa as well as potential alterations of this response in inflammatory bowel disease.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (5), e97780-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>e97780</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Schroeder-Braunstein J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Gras J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Brors B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schwarz S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Szikszai T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Lasitschka F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Wabnitz G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Heidtmann A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Lee YS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Schiessling S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Leowardi C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Al-Saeedi M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Ulrich A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Engelke A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Winter J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Samstag Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Giese T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Meuer S" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24841635</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0097780</DOI><KST>B080</KST><KST>G200</KST><KEYWORD>BOWEL-DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN GUT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NF-KAPPA-B</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MACROPHAGES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>T-LYMPHOCYTES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPITHELIAL-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ULCERATIVE-COLITIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CROHNS-DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM STRESS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUCOSAL</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52456</publishedID><Artikel>The onset of p53 loss of heterozygosity is differentially induced in various stem cell types and may involve the loss of either allele</Artikel><Journal>Cell Death and Differentiation</Journal><ABSTr>p53 loss of heterozygosity (p53LOH) is frequently observed in Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) patients who carry a mutant (Mut) p53 germ-line mutation.

Although adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) robustly underwent p53LOH, p53LOH in induced embryonic pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) was significantly attenuated. Only SCs that underwent p53LOH induced malignant tumors in mice. These results may explain why LFS patients develop normally, yet acquire tumors in adulthood. Surprisingly, an analysis of single-cell sub-clones of iPSCs, MSCs and ex vivo bone marrow (BM) progenitors revealed that p53LOH is a bi-directional process, which may result in either the loss of wild-type (WT) or Mut p53 allele. Interestingly, most BM progenitors underwent Mutp53LOH. Our results suggest that the bi-directional p53LOH process may function as a cell-fate checkpoint. The loss of Mutp53 may be regarded as a DNA repair event leading to genome stability. Indeed, gene expression analysis of the p53LOH process revealed upregulation of a specific chromatin remodeler and a burst of DNA repair genes. However, in the case of loss of WTp53, cells are endowed with uncontrolled growth that promotes cancer.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>21 (9), 1419-1431</Feld596><PubVol>21</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>1419</StrtPage><EndPage>1431</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Shetzer Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Kagan S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Koifman G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Sarig R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kogan-Sakin I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Charni M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Kaufman T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Zapatka M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Molchadsky A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Rivlin N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Dinowitz N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Levin S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Landan G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Goldstein I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Goldfinger N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Peer D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Radlwimmer B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="17" name="Lichter P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="18" name="Rotter V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Aloni-Grinstein R" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24832469</PMID><DOI>10.1038/cdd.2014.57</DOI><KST>B060</KST><KEYWORD>STATE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LI-FRAUMENI-SYNDROME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSFORMATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COPY NUMBER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REPAIR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DUAL ROLE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MODEL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VITRO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52458</publishedID><Artikel>The frequency of re-planning and its variability dependent on the modification of the re-planning criteria and IGRT correction strategy in head and neck IMRT</Artikel><Journal>Radiation Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: To analyse the frequency of re-planning and its variability dependent on the IGRT correction strategy and on the modification of the dosimetric criteria for re-planning for the spinal cord in head and neck IG-IMRT. METHODS: Daily kV-control-CTs of six head and neck patients (=175 CTs) were analysed. All volumes of interest were re-contoured using deformable image registration. Three IGRT correction strategies were simulated and the resulting dose distributions were computed for all fractions. Different sets of criteria with varying dose thresholds for re-planning were investigated. All sets of criteria ensure equivalent target coverage of both CTVs, but vary in the tolerance threshold of the spinal cord. RESULTS: The variations of the D95 and D2 in respect to the planned values ranged from -7% to +3% for both CTVs, and -2% to +6% for the spinal cord. Despite different correction vectors of the three IGRT strategies, the dosimetric differences were small. The number of fractions not requiring re-planning varied between 0% and 11% dependent on the applied IGRT correction strategy. In contrast, this number ranged between 32% and 70% dependent on the dosimetric thresholds, even though these thresholds were only gently modified. CONCLUSIONS: The more precise the planned dose needs to be maintained over the treatment course, the more frequently re-planning is required. The influence of different IGRT correction strategies, even though geometrically notable, was found to be of only limited relevance for the re-planning frequency. In contrast, the definition and modification of thresholds for re-planning have a major impact on the re-planning frequency.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (), Art.Nr.: 175-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>Art.Nr.: 175</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Stoll M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Giske K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Debus J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Bendl R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Stoiber EM" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25112458</PMID><DOI>10.1186/1748-717X-9-175</DOI><KST>E050</KST><KST>E040</KST><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALGORITHM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RADIATION-THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>UNCERTAINTIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>adaptive radiotherapy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DEFORMABLE IMAGE REGISTRATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SETUP ERRORS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52459</publishedID><Artikel>Cytokine-Regulated GADD45G Induces Differentiation and Lineage Selection in Hematopoietic Stem Cells</Artikel><Journal>Stem Cell Reports</Journal><ABSTr>The balance of self-renewal and differentiation in long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSC) must be strictly controlled to maintain blood homeostasis and to prevent leukemogenesis. Hematopoietic cytokines can induce differentiation in LT-HSCs; however, the molecular mechanism orchestrating this delicate balance requires further elucidation. We identified the tumor suppressor GADD45G as an instructor of LT-HSC differentiation under the control of differentiation-promoting cytokine receptor signaling. GADD45G immediately induces and accelerates differentiation in LT-HSCs and overrides the self-renewal program by specifically activating MAP3K4-mediated MAPK p38. Conversely, the absence of GADD45G enhances the self-renewal potential of LT-HSCs. Videomicroscopy-based tracking of single LT-HSCs revealed that, once GADD45G is expressed, the development of LT-HSCs into lineage-committed progeny occurred within 36 hr and uncovered a selective lineage choice with a severe reduction in megakaryocytic-erythroid cells. Here, we report an unrecognized role of GADD45G as a central molecular linker of extrinsic cytokine differentiation and lineage choice control in hematopoiesis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>3 (1), 34-43</Feld596><PubVol>3</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>34</StrtPage><EndPage>43</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Thalheimer FB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Wingert S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="De Giacomo P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Haetscher N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Rehage M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Brill B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Theis FJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Hennighausen L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Schroeder T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Rieger MA" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25068120</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.stemcr.2014.05.010</DOI><KST>L501</KST><KEYWORD>GADD45-GAMMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SELF-RENEWAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPANSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>p38 MAPK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STRESS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>KINASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52460</publishedID><Artikel>p53-dependent Nestin regulation links tumor suppression to cellular plasticity in liver cancer</Artikel><Journal>Cell</Journal><ABSTr>The p53 tumor suppressor coordinates a series of antiproliferative responses that restrict the expansion of malignant cells, and as a consequence, p53 is lost or mutated in the majority of human cancers. Here, we show that p53 restricts expression of the stem and progenitor-cell-associated protein nestin in an Sp1/3 transcription-factor-dependent manner and that Nestin is required for tumor initiation in vivo. Moreover, loss of p53 facilitates dedifferentiation of mature hepatocytes into nestin-positive progenitor-like cells, which are poised to differentiate into hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) or cholangiocarcinomas (CCs) in response to lineage-specific mutations that target Wnt and Notch signaling, respectively. Many human HCCs and CCs show elevated nestin expression, which correlates with p53 loss of function and is associated with decreased patient survival. Therefore, transcriptional repression of Nestin by p53 restricts cellular plasticity and tumorigenesis in liver cancer.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>158 (3), 579-592</Feld596><PubVol>158</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>579</StrtPage><EndPage>592</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Tschaharganeh DF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Xue W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Calvisi DF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Evert M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Michurina TV" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Dow LE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Banito A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Katz SF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Kastenhuber ER" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Weissmueller S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Huang CH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Lechel A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Andersen JB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Capper D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="14" name="Zender L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Longerich T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Enikolopov G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Lowe SW" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25083869</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.cell.2014.05.051</DOI><KST>G380</KST><KEYWORD>MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIFFERENTIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>p53</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STEM-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTERMEDIATE-FILAMENT NESTIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DEDIFFERENTIATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52488</publishedID><Artikel>Evidence that breast cancer risk at the 2q35 locus is mediated through IGFBP5 regulation</Artikel><Journal>Nature Communications</Journal><ABSTr>GWAS have identified a breast cancer susceptibility locus on 2q35. Here we report the fine mapping of this locus using data from 101,943 subjects from 50 case-control studies. We genotype 276 SNPs using the 'iCOGS' genotyping array and impute genotypes for a further 1,284 using 1000 Genomes Project data. All but two, strongly correlated SNPs (rs4442975 G/T and rs6721996 G/A) are excluded as candidate causal variants at odds against &gt;100:1. The best functional candidate, rs4442975, is associated with oestrogen receptor positive (ER+) disease with an odds ratio (OR) in Europeans of 0.85 (95% confidence interval = 0.84 - 0.87; P = 1.7 x 10(-43)) per t-allele. This SNP flanks a transcriptional enhancer that physically interacts with the promoter of IGFBP5 (encoding insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 5) and displays allele-specific gene expression, FOXA1 binding and chromatin looping. Evidence suggests that the g-allele confers increased breast cancer susceptibility through relative downregulation of IGFBP5, a gene with known roles in breast cell biology.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>4 (), Art.

We overcome these limitations by utilizing low flip angle, variable rate selective excitation (VERSE) algorithm saturation pulses. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-five neurosurgical patients (male n = 8, female n = 17; average age 49.64 years; range 26-70 years) with different intracranial vascular pathologies were enrolled in this trial. All patients were examined with a 7 Tesla (Magnetom 7 T, Siemens) whole body scanner system utilizing a dedicated 32-channel head coil. For venous saturation pulses a 35 degrees flip angle was applied. Two neuroradiologists evaluated the delineation of arterial vessels in the Circle of Willis, delineation of vascular pathologies, presence of artifacts, vessel-tissue contrast and overall image quality of TOF MRA scans in consensus on a five-point scale. Normalized signal intensities in the confluence of venous sinuses, M1 segment of left middle cerebral artery and adjacent gray matter were measured and vessel-tissue contrasts were calculated. RESULTS: Ratings for the majority of patients ranged between good and excellent for most of the evaluated features. Venous saturation was sufficient for all cases with minor artifacts in arteriovenous malformations and arteriovenous fistulas. Quantitative signal intensity measurements showed high vessel-tissue contrast for confluence of venous sinuses, M1 segment of left middle cerebral artery and adjacent gray matter. CONCLUSION: The use of novel low flip angle VERSE algorithm pulses for saturation of venous vessels can overcome SAR limitations in 7 Tesla ultra-high-resolution TOF MRA. Our protocol is suitable for clinical application with excellent image quality for delineation of various intracranial vascular pathologies.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (9), e106697-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>e106697</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Wrede KH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Johst S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Dammann P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Ozkan N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Monninghoff C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Kraemer M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Maderwald S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Ladd ME" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Sure U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Umutlu L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Schlamann M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25232868</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0106697</DOI><KST>E020</KST><KEYWORD>CONTRAST</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FOLLOW-UP</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>brain</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIGITAL-SUBTRACTION-ANGIOGRAPHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MR-ANGIOGRAPHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INITIAL-EXPERIENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTRACRANIAL ANEURYSMS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LENTICULOSTRIATE ARTERIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>1.5T</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PRESATURATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52493</publishedID><Artikel>Molecular characterization of common fragile sites as a strategy to discover cancer susceptibility genes</Artikel><Journal>Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences</Journal><ABSTr>The cytogenetic hypothesis that common fragile sites (cFSs) are hotspots of cancer breakpoints is increasingly supported by recent data from whole-genome profiles of different cancers. cFSs are components of the normal chromosome structure that are particularly prone to breakage under conditions of replication stress. In recent years, cFSs have become of increasing interest in cancer research, as they not only appear to be frequent targets of genomic alterations in progressive tumors, but also already in precancerous lesions. Despite growing evidence of their importance in disease development, most cFSs have not been investigated at the molecular level and most cFS genes have not been identified. In this review, we summarize the current data on molecularly characterized cFSs, their genetic and epigenetic characteristics, and put emphasis on less-studied cFS genes as potential contributors to cancer development.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>71 (23), 4561-4575</Feld596><PubVol>71</PubVol><PubIss>23</PubIss><StrtPage>4561</StrtPage><EndPage>4575</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Savelyeva L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Brueckner LM" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25231336</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00018-014-1723-z</DOI><KST>B087</KST><KEYWORD>REPLICATION DYNAMICS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN-CHROMOSOME 7</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PREFERENTIAL INTEGRATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VIRAL INTEGRATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MULTIPLE-MYELOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COPY NUMBER CHANGES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RENAL-CELL CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA-DAMAGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN GENOME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52497</publishedID><Artikel>Co-expression of MET and CD47 is a novel prognosticator for survival of luminal breast cancer patients</Artikel><Journal>Oncotarget</Journal><ABSTr>Although luminal-type primary breast cancer can be efficiently treated, development of metastatic disease remains a significant clinical problem. We have previously shown that luminal-type circulating tumor cells (CTCs) co-expressing the tyrosine-kinase MET and CD47, a ligand involved in cancer cell evasion from macrophage scavenging, are able to initiate metastasis in xenografts. Here, we investigated the clinical relevance of MET-CD47 co-expression in 255 hormone receptor positive breast tumors by immunohistochemistry and found a 10.3- year mean overall-survival difference between MET-CD47 double-positive and double-negative patients (p&lt;0.001) MET-CD47 co-expression defined a novel independent prognosticator for overall-survival by multivariate analysis (Cox proportional hazards model: HR: 4.1, p&lt;0.002) and CD47 expression alone or in combination with MET was strongly associated with lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, flow cytometric analysis of metastatic patient blood revealed consistent presence of MET+CD47+ CTCs (range 0.8 - 33.3% of CTCs) and their frequency was associated with increased metastatic spread. Finally, primary uncultured CTCs with high MET+CD47+ content showed an enhanced capacity to initiate metastasis in mice. Detection and targeting of MET and CD47 may thus provide a rational basis for risk stratification and treatment of patients with luminal-type breast cancer.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>5 (18), 8147-8160</Feld596><PubVol>5</PubVol><PubIss>18</PubIss><StrtPage>8147</StrtPage><EndPage>8160</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Baccelli I" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Stenzinger A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Vogel V" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Pfitzner BM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Klein C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Wallwiener M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Scharpff M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Saini M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Holland-Letz T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Sinn HP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Schneeweiss A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Denkert C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Weichert W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Trumpp A" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25230070</PMID><KST>A010</KST><KST>C060</KST><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LUNG-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CIRCULATING TUMOR-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>C-MET</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THERAPEUTIC TARGET</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LEUKEMIA STEM-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SIRP-ALPHA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TIVANTINIB</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52499</publishedID><Artikel>Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms Within the Thrombomodulin Gene (THBD) Predict Mortality in Patients With Graft-Versus-Host Disease</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Clinical Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: Steroid-refractory graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major and often fatal complication after allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (alloSCT). Although the pathophysiology of steroid refractoriness is not fully understood, evidence is accumulating that endothelial cell stress is involved, and endothelial thrombomodulin (THBD) plays a role in this process. Here we assess whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the THBD gene predict outcome after alloSCT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seven SNPs within the THBD gene were studied (rs1962, rs1042579, rs1042580, rs3176123, rs3176124, rs3176126, and rs3176134) in a training cohort of 306 patients. The relevant genotypes were then validated in an independent cohort (n = 321). RESULTS: In the training cohort, an increased risk of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was associated with three of seven SNPs tested: rs1962, rs1042579 (in linkage disequilibrium with rs3176123), and rs1042580. When patients were divided into risk groups (one v no high-risk SNP), a strong correlation with NRM was observed (hazard ratio [HR], 2.31; 95% CI, 1.36 to 3.95; P = .002). More specifically, NRM was predicted by THBD SNPs in patients who later developed GVHD (HR, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.61 to 5.68; P &lt; .001) but not in patients without GVHD. In contrast, THBD SNPs did not predict incidence of acute GVHD. Multivariable analyses adjusting for clinical variables confirmed the independent effect of THBD SNPs on NRM. All findings could be reproduced in the validation cohort. CONCLUSION: THBD SNPs predict mortality of manifest GVHD but not the risk of acquiring GVHD, supporting the hypothesis that endothelial vulnerability contributes to GVHD refractoriness.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>32 (30), 3421-3427</Feld596><PubVol>32</PubVol><PubIss>30</PubIss><StrtPage>3421</StrtPage><EndPage>3427</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Rachakonda SP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Penack O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Dietrich S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Blau O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Blau IW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Radujkovic A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Isermann B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Ho AD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Uharek L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Dreger P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Kumar R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Luft T" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25225421</PMID><DOI>10.1200/JCO.2013.54.4056</DOI><KST>C050</KST><KEYWORD>ACTIVATED PROTEIN-C</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALA455VAL POLYMORPHISM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PLASMA THROMBOMODULIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DYSFUNCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMPETING RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HAPLOTYPE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POPULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52500</publishedID><Artikel>De Novo proteome analysis of genetically modified tumor cells by a metabolic labeling/azide-alkyne cycloaddition approach</Artikel><Journal>Molecular and Cellular Proteomics</Journal><ABSTr>Activin receptor type II (ACVR2) is a member of the transforming growth factor type II receptor (TGFBR2) family and controls cell growth and differentiation thereby acting as a tumor suppressor. ACVR2 inactivation is known to drive colorectal tumorigenesis. We used an ACVR2-deficient microsatellite unstable colon cancer cell line (HCT116) to set up a novel experimental design for comprehensive analysis of proteomic changes associated with such functional loss of a tumor suppressor. To this end we combined two existing technologies. First, the ACVR2 gene was reconstituted in an ACVR2-deficient colorectal cancer cell line by Recombinase Mediated Cassette Exchange (RMCE), resulting in the generation of an inducible expression system, which allows the regulation of ACVR2 gene expression in a doxycycline-dependent manner. Functional expression in the induced cells was explicitly proven. Second, we used the methionine analogue azidohomoalanine for metabolic labeling of newly synthesized proteins in our cell line model. Labeled proteins were tagged with biotin by a Click-it chemistry approach enabling specific extraction of labeled proteins by streptavidin-coated beads. Tryptic on-bead digestion of captured proteins and subsequent UPLC-coupled LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometry identified 513 proteins, 25 of them being differentially expressed between ACVR2-deficient and -proficient cells. Among these, several candidates that have already been linked to colorectal cancer (CRC) or play a key role in cell growth or apoptosis control were identified thereby proving the utility of the presented experimental approach. In principle, this strategy can be adapted to analyze any gene of interest and its effect on the cellular de novo proteome.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>13 (12), 3446-3456</Feld596><PubVol>13</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>3446</StrtPage><EndPage>3456</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ballikaya S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Lee J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Warnken U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schnoelzer M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Gebert J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Kopitz J" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25225355</PMID><DOI>10.1074/mcp.M113.036665</DOI><KST>B100</KST><KST>G105</KST></row><row><publishedID>52501</publishedID><Artikel>Plakophilins 1 and 3 bind to FXR1 and thereby influence the mRNA stability of desmosomal proteins</Artikel><Journal>Molecular and Cellular Biology</Journal><ABSTr>Plakophilins 1 and 3 (PKP1/3) are members of the arm-repeat family of catenin proteins and serve as structural components of desmosomes important for cell-cell-adhesion. In addition, PKP1/3 occur as soluble proteins outside of desmosomes, yet their role in the cytoplasm is not known so far. We found that cytoplasmic PKP1/3 were co-precipitated with the RNA-binding proteins FXR1, G3BP, PABPC1 and UPF1 and these PKP1/3 complexes also comprised desmoplakin and PKP2 mRNAs. Moreover, we showed that the interaction of PKP1/3 with G3BP, PABPC1 and UPF1 but not with FXR1 was RNase-sensitive. To address the cytoplasmic function of PKP1/3 we performed gain and loss of function studies. Both PKP1 and PKP3 knock down cell lines showed reduced protein and mRNA levels for desmoplakin and PKP2. Whereas global rates of translation were unaffected, desmoplakin and PKP2 mRNA were destabilized. Furthermore, binding of PKP1/3 to FXR1 was RNA-independent, and both PKP3 and FXR1 stabilized PKP2 mRNA. Our results demonstrate that cytoplasmic PKP1/3 are components of mRNA ribonucleoprotein particles and act as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>34 (23), 4244-4256</Feld596><PubVol>34</PubVol><PubIss>23</PubIss><StrtPage>4244</StrtPage><EndPage>4256</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Fischer-Keso R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Breuninger S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Hofmann S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Henn M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Roehrig T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Strobel P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Stoecklin G" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Hofmann I" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25225333</PMID><DOI>10.1128/MCB.00766-14</DOI><KST>A190</KST><KST>A200</KST><KEYWORD>CELL-ADHESION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPITHELIAL-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PLAQUE PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POLY(A)-BINDING PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EUKARYOTIC TRANSLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STRESS GRANULES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXON JUNCTION COMPLEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STIMULATE TRANSLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR-PROGRESSION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52503</publishedID><Artikel>KATP channels modulate intrinsic firing activity of immature entorhinal cortex layer III neurons</Artikel><Journal>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience</Journal><ABSTr>Medial temporal lobe structures are essential for memory formation which is associated with coherent network oscillations. During ontogenesis, these highly organized patterns develop from distinct, less synchronized forms of network activity. This maturation process goes along with marked changes in intrinsic firing patterns of individual neurons. One critical factor determining neuronal excitability is activity of ATP-sensitive K(+) channels (KATP channels) which coupled electrical activity to metabolic state. Here, we examined the role of KATP channels for intrinsic firing patterns and emerging network activity in the immature medial entorhinal cortex (mEC) of rats. Western blot analysis of Kir6.2 (a subunit of the KATP channel) confirmed expression of this protein in the immature entorhinal cortex. Neuronal activity was monitored by field potential (fp) and whole-cell recordings from layer III (LIII) of the mEC in horizontal brain slices obtained at postnatal day (P) 6-13. Spontaneous fp-bursts were suppressed by the KATP channel opener diazoxide and prolonged after blockade of KATP channels by glibenclamide. Immature mEC LIII principal neurons displayed two dominant intrinsic firing patterns, prolonged bursts or regular firing activity, respectively. Burst discharges were suppressed by the KATP channel openers diazoxide and NN414, and enhanced by the KATP channel blockers tolbutamide and glibenclamide. Activity of regularly firing neurons was modulated in a frequency-dependent manner: the diazoxide-mediated reduction of firing correlated negatively with basal frequency, while the tolbutamide-mediated increase of firing showed a positive correlation. These data are in line with an activity-dependent regulation of KATP channel activity. Together, KATP channels exert powerful modulation of intrinsic firing patterns and network activity in the immature mEC.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>8 (), Art.Nr.: 255-</Feld596><PubVol>8</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>Art.Nr.: 255</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Lemak MS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Voloshanenko O" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Draguhn A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Egorov AV" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25221474</PMID><DOI>10.3389/fncel.2014.00255</DOI><KST>B110</KST><KEYWORD>SENSITIVE POTASSIUM CHANNELS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GIANT DEPOLARIZING POTENTIALS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TEMPORAL ASSOCIATION MEMORY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HIPPOCAMPAL CA1 NEURONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PYRAMIDAL NEURONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXCITATORY ACTIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CORTICAL-NEURONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RAT HIPPOCAMPUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CEREBRAL-CORTEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VITRO</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52504</publishedID><Artikel>Glioblastoma Recurrence Patterns After Radiation Therapy With Regard to the Subventricular Zone</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: We evaluated the influence of tumor location and tumor spread in primary glioblastoma (GBM), with respect to the subventricular zone (SVZ), on recurrence behavior, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). METHODS AND MATERIALS: 607 patients (376 male and 231 female) with a median age of 61.3 years (range, 3.0-87.9 years) and primary GBM treated with radiation therapy (RT) from 2004 to 2012 at a single institution were included in this retrospective study. Preoperative images and follow-up examination results were assessed to evaluate tumor location. Tumors were classified according to the tumor location in relation to the SVZ. RESULTS: The median PFS of the study population was 5.2 months (range, 1-91 months), and the median OS was 13.8 months (range, 1-102 months). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that tumor location in close proximity to the SVZ was associated with a significant decline in PFS and OS (4.8 and 12.3 months, respectively; each P&lt;.001). Furthermore, in cases where tumors were involved with the SVZ, distant cerebral progression (43.8%; P=.005) and multifocal progression (39.8%; P=.008) were more common. Interestingly, opening of the ventricle during the previous surgery showed no impact on PFS and OS. CONCLUSION: GBM in close proximity to the SVZ was associated with decreased survival and had a higher risk of multifocal or distant progression. Ventricle opening during surgery had no effect on survival rates.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>90 (4), 886-893</Feld596><PubVol>90</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>886</StrtPage><EndPage>893</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Adeberg S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Koenig L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bostel T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Harrabi S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Welzel T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Debus J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Combs SE" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25220720</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.ijrobp.2014.07.027</DOI><KST>E050</KST><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>radiotherapy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGNOSTIC-FACTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>temozolomide</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEURAL STEM-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MALIGNANT GLIOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECURSIVE PARTITIONING ANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MULTIFORME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEWLY-DIAGNOSED GLIOBLASTOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADULT BRAIN</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52505</publishedID><Artikel>Studies on molecular properties prediction and histamine H receptor affinities of novel ligands with uracil-based motifs</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry</Journal><ABSTr>The histamine H3 receptor (H3R) plays a role in cognitive and memory processes and is involved in different neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and narcolepsy.

However, many other promising candidates failed due to their pharmacokinetic profile, mostly because of their strong lipophilicity accompanied with low solubility. Analysis of previous potential H3R selective antagonists/inverse agonists, e.g. pitolisant, revealed promising results concerning physicochemical properties and drug-likeness. Herein, a series of new hH3R ligands 8-20 consisting of piperidin-1-yl or piperidin-1-yl-propoxyphenyl coupled to different uracil, thymine, and 5,6-dimethyluracil related moieties, were synthesized, evaluated on their binding properties at the hH3R and the estimation of different physicochemical and drug-likeness properties. Due to the coupling to various positions at pyrimidine-2,4-(1H,3H)-dione, affinity at hH3Rs and drug-likeness parameters have been improved. For instance, compound 9 showed in addition to high affinity at the hH3R (pKi (hH3R) = 8.14) clog S, clog P, LE, LipE, and drug-likeness score values of -4.36, 3.47, 0.34, 4.63, and 1.54, respectively.

A few studies have evaluated their association with non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), but the results are inconsistent. In the current study, we aim to assess the impact of XRCC1 R399Q and XRCC3 T241M polymorphisms on the risk of NMSC associated with sunlight and arsenic exposure. Study participants consist of 618 new cases of NMSC and 527 hospital-based controls frequency matched on age, sex, and county of residence from Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia. Adjusted effects are estimated using multivariable logistic regression. The results indicate an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) for the homozygous variant genotype of XRCC1 R399Q (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.14-5.65) and a protective effect against basal cell carcinoma (BCC) for the homozygous variant genotype of XRCC3 T241M (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.41-0.92), compared with the respective homozygous common genotypes. Significant interactions are detected between XRCC3 T241M and sunlight exposure at work, and between XRCC3 T241M and exposure to arsenic in drinking water (p-value for interaction &lt;0.10). In conclusion, the current study demonstrates that polymorphisms in XRCC genes may modify the associations between skin cancer risk and exposure to sunlight or arsenic. Given the high prevalence of genetic polymorphisms modifying the association between exposure to environmental carcinogens and NMSC, these results are of substantial relevance to public health.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>134C (), 382-389</Feld596><PubVol>134C</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>382</StrtPage><EndPage>389</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Surdu S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Fitzgerald EF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bloom MS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Boscoe FP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Carpenter DO" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Haase RF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Gurzau E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Rudnai P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Koppova K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Vahter M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Leonardi G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Goessler W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Kumar R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Fletcher T" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25218703</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.envres.2014.08.020</DOI><KST>C050</KST><KEYWORD>SLOVAKIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>mechanisms</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUSCEPTIBILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VARIANTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METAANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISMS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUN EXPOSURE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ULTRAVIOLET-RADIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BASAL-CELL CARCINOMA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52507</publishedID><Artikel>Vascular importance of the miR-212/132 cluster</Artikel><Journal>European Heart Journal</Journal><ABSTr>RATIONALE: Many processes in endothelial cells including angiogenic responses are regulated by microRNAs. However, there is limited information available about their complex cross-talk in regulating certain endothelial functions. AIM: The objective of this study is to identify endothelial functions of the pro-hypertrophic miR-212/132 cluster and its cross-talk with other microRNAs during development and disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: We here show that anti-angiogenic stimulation by transforming growth factor-beta activates the microRNA-212/132 cluster by derepression of their transcriptional co-activator cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) which is a novel target of a previously identified pro-angiogenic miRNA miR-30a-3p in endothelial cells. Surprisingly, despite having the same seed-sequence, miR-212 and miR-132 exerted differential effects on endothelial transcriptome regulation and cellular functions with stronger endothelial inhibitory effects caused by miR-212. These differences could be attributed to additional auxiliary binding of miR-212 to its targets. In vivo, deletion of the miR-212/132 cluster increased endothelial vasodilatory function, improved angiogenic responses during postnatal development and in adult mice. CONCLUSION: Our results identify (i) a novel miRNA-cross-talk involving miR-30a-3p and miR-212, which led to suppression of important endothelial genes such as GAB1 and SIRT1 finally culminating in impaired endothelial function; and (ii) microRNAs may have different biological roles despite having the same seed sequence.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>35 (45), 3224-3231</Feld596><PubVol>35</PubVol><PubIss>45</PubIss><StrtPage>3224</StrtPage><EndPage>3231</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kumarswamy R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Volkmann I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Beermann J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Napp LC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Jabs O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Bhayadia R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Melk A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Ucar A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Chowdhury K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Lorenzen JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Gupta SK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Batkai S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Thum T" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25217442</PMID><DOI>10.1093/eurheartj/ehu344</DOI><KST>D090</KST><KEYWORD>MicroRNAs</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTEGRITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONTRIBUTES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FACTOR-BETA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSFORMING-GROWTH-FACTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EFFICACY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STABILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHWAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANGIOGENESIS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52508</publishedID><Artikel>Fc-Optimized NKG2D-Fc Constructs Induce NK Cell Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity against Breast Cancer Cells Independently of HER2/neu Expression Status</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Immunology</Journal><ABSTr>The ability of NK cells to mediate Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) largely contributes to the clinical success of antitumor Abs, including trastuzumab, which is approved for the treatment of breast cancer with HER2/neu overexpression. Notably, only approximately 25% of breast cancer patients overexpress HER2/neu. Moreover, HER2/neu is expressed on healthy cells, and trastuzumab application is associated with side effects. In contrast, the ligands of the activating immunoreceptor NKG2D (NKG2DL) are selectively expressed on malignant cells. In this study, we took advantage of the tumor-associated expression of NKG2DL by using them as target Ags for NKG2D-IgG1 fusion proteins optimized by amino acid exchange S239D/I332E in their Fc part. Compared to constructs with wild-type Fc parts, fusion proteins carrying the S239D/I332E modification (NKG2D-Fc-ADCC) mediated highly enhanced degranulation, ADCC, and IFN-gamma production of NK cells in response to breast cancer cells. NKG2D-Fc-ADCC substantially enhanced NK reactivity also against HER2/neu-low targets that were unaffected by trastuzumab, as both compounds mediated their immunostimulatory effects in strict dependence of target Ag expression levels. Thus, in line with the hierarchically organized potential of the various activating receptors governing NK reactivity and due to its highly increased affinity to CD16, NKG2D-Fc-ADCC potently enhances NK cell reactivity despite the inevitable reduction of activating signals upon binding to NKG2DL. Due to the tumor-restricted expression of NKG2DL, NKG2D-Fc-ADCC may constitute an attractive means for immunotherapy especially of HER2/neu-low or -negative breast cancer.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>193 (8), 4261-4272</Feld596><PubVol>193</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>4261</StrtPage><EndPage>4272</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Raab S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Steinbacher J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Schmiedel BJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kousis PC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Steinle A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Jung G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Grosse-Hovest L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Salih HR" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25217158</PMID><DOI>10.4049/jimmunol.1400872</DOI><KST>L801</KST><KEYWORD>THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIGAND</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MHC CLASS-I</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NATURAL-KILLER-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>leukemia</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>rituximab</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATING RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRASTUZUMAB</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECEPTOR POLYMORPHISMS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52509</publishedID><Artikel>Hypofractionated IMRT of the Prostate Bed After Radical Prostatectomy: Acute Toxicity in the PRIAMOS-1 Trial</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: Hypofractionated radiation therapy as primary treatment for prostate cancer is currently being investigated in large phase 3 trials. However, there are few data on postoperative hypofractionation. The Radiation therapy for the Prostate Bed With or Without the Pelvic Lymph Nodes (PRIAMOS 1) trial was initiated as a prospective phase 2 trial to assess treatment safety and toxicity of a hypofractionated intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) of the prostate bed. METHODS AND MATERIALS: From February to September 2012, 40 patients with indications for adjuvant or salvage radiation therapy were enrolled. One patient dropped out before treatment. Patients received 54 Gy in 18 fractions to the prostate bed with IMRT and daily image guidance. Gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicities (according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0) were recorded weekly during treatment and 10 weeks after radiation therapy. RESULTS: Overall acute toxicity was favorable, with no recorded adverse events grade &gt;/=3. Acute GI toxicity rates were 56.4% (grade 1) and 17.9% (grade 2). Acute GU toxicity was recorded in 35.9% of patients (maximum grade 1). Urinary stress incontinence was not influenced by radiation therapy. The incidence of grade 1 urinary urge incontinence increased from 2.6% before to 23.1% 10 weeks after therapy, but grade 2 urge incontinence remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative hypofractionated IMRT of the prostate bed is tolerated well, with no severe acute side effects.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>90 (4), 926-933</Feld596><PubVol>90</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>926</StrtPage><EndPage>933</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Katayama S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Striecker T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kessel K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Sterzing F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Habl G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Edler L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Debus J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Herfarth K" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25216858</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.ijrobp.2014.07.015</DOI><KST>E050</KST><KST>E040</KST><KEYWORD>SALVAGE RADIOTHERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FRACTIONATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXTERNAL-BEAM RADIOTHERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADJUVANT RADIOTHERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POSTOPERATIVE RADIOTHERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RADIATION-THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTENSITY-MODULATED RADIOTHERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RANDOMIZED-TRIAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52510</publishedID><Artikel>tRNAs: new tricks from old dogs</Artikel><Journal>EMBO Journal</Journal><ABSTr>tRNA biology has lately seen a revival with the discovery of tRNA cleavage products as mediators of stress responses.

Here, we describe a system that enables pooled shRNA screening directly in mouse hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) in vivo to identify genes likely to be involved in therapy resistance. Using a focused shRNA library targeting genes located within focal genomic amplifications of human HCC, we screened for genes whose inhibition increased the therapeutic efficacy of the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib. Both shRNA-mediated and pharmacological silencing of Mapk14 (p38alpha) were found to sensitize mouse HCC to sorafenib therapy and prolong survival by abrogating Mapk14-dependent activation of Mek-Erk and Atf2 signaling. Elevated Mapk14-Atf2 signaling predicted poor response to sorafenib therapy in human HCC, and sorafenib resistance of p-Mapk14-expressing HCC cells could be reverted by silencing Mapk14. Our results suggest that a combination of sorafenib and Mapk14 blockade is a promising approach to overcoming therapy resistance of human HCC.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>20 (10), 1138-1146</Feld596><PubVol>20</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>1138</StrtPage><EndPage>1146</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Rudalska R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Dauch D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Longerich T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="McJunkin K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Wuestefeld T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Kang TW" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Hohmeyer A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Pesic M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Leibold J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="von Thun A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Schirmacher P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Zuber J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Weiss KH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Powers S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Malek NP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Eilers M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Sipos B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="17" name="Lowe SW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Geffers R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Laufer S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Zender L" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25216638</PMID><DOI>10.1038/nm.3679</DOI><KST>L801</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>ADVANCED HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MAP KINASES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTEGRATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>KINASE INHIBITORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>senescence</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>sensitivity</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STRATEGIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHWAYS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>JAK/STAT</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52512</publishedID><Artikel>Measuring genetic interactions in human cells by RNAi and imaging</Artikel><Journal>Nature Protocols</Journal><ABSTr>Observation of how genetic interactions modulate phenotypes is a powerful method for dissecting their underlying molecular and functional networks.

METHODS: Principal investigators of prospective studies on circulating fatty acids and prostate cancer were invited to collaborate. Investigators provided individual participant data on circulating fatty acids (weight percent) and other characteristics of prostate cancer cases and controls. Prostate cancer risk by study-specific fifths of 14 fatty acids was estimated using multivariable-adjusted conditional logistic regression. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Five thousand and ninety-eight case patients and 6649 control patients from seven studies with an average follow-up of 5.1 (SD = 3.3) years were included. Stearic acid (18:0) was inversely associated with total prostate cancer (odds ratio [OR] Q5 vs Q1 = 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.78 to 1.00, P trend = .043). Prostate cancer risk was, respectively, 14% and 16% greater in the highest fifth of eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.29, Ptrend = .001) and docosapentaenoic acid (22:5n-3) (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.33, P trend = .003), but in each case there was heterogeneity between studies (P = .022 and P &lt; .001, respectively). There was heterogeneity in the association between docosapentaenoic acid and prostate cancer by grade of disease (P = .006); the association was statistically significant for low-grade disease but not high-grade disease. The remaining 11 fatty acids were not statistically associated with total prostate cancer risk. CONCLUSION: There was no strong evidence that circulating fatty acids are important predictors of prostate cancer risk. It is not clear whether the modest associations of stearic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosapentaenoic acid are causal.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>106 (9), -</Feld596><PubVol>106</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage/><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Crowe FL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Appleby PN" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Travis RC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Barnett M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Brasky TM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Chajes V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Chavarro JE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Chirlaque MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="English DR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Gibson RA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Giles GG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Goodman GE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Henning SM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Kaaks R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="King IB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Kolonel LN" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Kristal AR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Neuhouser ML" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Park SY" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Severi G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Siddiq A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Stampfer MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Stattin P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Tangen CM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Trichopoulos D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Wilkens LR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Key TJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Allen NE" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25210201</PMID><DOI>10.1093/jnci/dju240</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>PROGRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRIAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>C-REACTIVE PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SMOKERS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BLOOD</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MORTALITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BIOMARKERS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HORMONES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>insulin</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PLASMA PHOSPHOLIPIDS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52514</publishedID><Artikel>RPPanalyzer Toolbox: An improved R package for analysis of reverse phase protein array data</Artikel><Journal>Biotechniques</Journal><ABSTr>Analysis of large-scale proteomic data sets requires specialized software tools, tailored toward the requirements of individual approaches.

This population-based high resolution study from Germany aims at providing data on the usage of BRC treatment, the extent of adherence to CPG and, as a novelty, survival of BRC patients according to major recommended treatment options. Methods: Data from the Saarland Cancer Registry including women diagnosed with invasive BRC without distant metastasis and followed up between 2000 and 2009 were used. Provision of cancer care according to major treatment options is presented by age, clinical subtypes of BRC, and over time. Conventional and modeled period analysis was used to derive estimates of most up-to-date 5-year relative survival (RS) and the effect of non-adherence to CPG on relative excess risk of death (RER). Results: The study revealed increasing guideline adherence, with high levels already seen for local treatment (e.g. 67% of the BRC patients in 2008/09 received breast conserving surgery), and substantial progress since the millennium change with regard to sentinel node dissection (SND) and adjuvant systemic treatments (e. g. SND and chemotherapy provided to 62% of all patients and 79% of the patients with nodal positive or hormone receptor negative BRC in 2008/09, respectively). It further demonstrated increased cancer related mortality among patients without guideline compliant cancer treatment (e. g. patients with nodal positive and hormone receptor negative BRC who were not treated with chemotherapy had a 5-year RS of 29% (RER: 2.89, 95% CI: 1.46-5.71) compared to 54% for patients obtaining chemotherapy). Conclusions: This study provides data on the implementation of CPG in a highly developed European country and extends available population-based survival data of BRC patients and may provide evidence of increased cancer related excess mortality, if BRC patients do not receive guideline compatible treatment</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>14 (), Art.

Previous studies have used a single 'baseline' measurement and such analyses cannot account for possible changes in these which may lead to a biased estimation of risk. Using four cohorts from CHANCES which had repeated measures in participants 50 years and older, multivariate time-dependent Cox proportional hazards was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) to examine the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and CRP with all-cause mortality and CVD. Being overweight (a parts per thousand yen25-&lt; 30 kg/m(2)) or moderately obese (a parts per thousand yen30-&lt; 35) tended to be associated with a lower risk of mortality compared to normal (a parts per thousand yen18.5-&lt; 25): ESTHER, HR (95 % CI) 0.69 (0.58-0.82) and 0.78 (0.63-0.97); Rotterdam, 0.86 (0.79-0.94) and 0.80 (0.72-0.89). A similar relationship was found, but only for overweight in Glostrup, HR (95 % CI) 0.88 (0.76-1.02); and moderately obese in Tromso, HR (95 % CI) 0.79 (0.62-1.01). Associations were not evident between repeated measures of BMI and CVD. Conversely, increasing CRP concentrations, measured on more than one occasion, were associated with an increasing risk of mortality and CVD. Being overweight or moderately obese is associated with a lower risk of mortality, while CRP, independent of BMI, is positively associated with mortality and CVD risk. If inflammation links CRP and BMI, they may participate in distinct/independent pathways. Accounting for independent changes in risk factors over time may be crucial for unveiling their effects on mortality and disease morbidity.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>29 (12), 887-897</Feld596><PubVol>29</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>887</StrtPage><EndPage>897</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="O’Doherty MG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Jørgensen T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Borglykke A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schöttker B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Wilsgaard T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Siganos G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Kavousi M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Hughes M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Müezzinler A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Holleczek B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Franco OH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Hofman A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Boffetta P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Kee F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="on behalf of the CHANCES consortium" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25421782</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s10654-014-9954-8</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>RISK MARKER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OLDER-ADULTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ARTERY-DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OVERWEIGHT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METAANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WEIGHT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OBESITY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52521</publishedID><Artikel>Focal delivery of AAV2/1-transgenes into the rat brain by localized ultrasound-induced BBB Opening</Artikel><Journal>Annals of Neurosciences</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>21 (1), 22-</Feld596><PubVol>21</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>22</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Alonso A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Reinz E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Leuchs B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kleinschmidt J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Fatar M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Geers B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Lentacker I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Hennerici MG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="de Smedt SC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Meairs S" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25206050</PMID><DOI>10.5214/ans.0972.7531.210107</DOI><KST>F010</KST></row><row><publishedID>52523</publishedID><Artikel>Protection against malaria by immunization with non-attenuated sporozoites under single-dose piperaquine-tetraphosphate chemoprophylaxis</Artikel><Journal>Vaccine</Journal><ABSTr>Experimental whole-parasite immunization through concurrent administration of infectious Plasmodium sporozoites with drugs that prevent pathogenic blood-stage infection represents the current benchmark in malaria vaccine development. Key questions concerning translation remain, including the requirement for single-dose drug regimens that can reliably prevent breakthrough infections. We assessed the feasibility and efficacy of immunization with single-dose piperaquine chemoprophylaxis and concurrent sporozoite administration (PPQ-CPS) in the murine P. berghei ANKA/C57BL/6 infection model. We demonstrate that PPQ-CPS is protective with an efficacy comparable to previous findings using whole-parasite immunization under chloroquine chemoprophylaxis. PPQ-CPS immunization resulted in an expansion of intrahepatic and intrasplenic effector memory CD8+ T cells. In summary, PPQ-CPS appears to be a safe and efficacious immunization regimen in the rodent malaria model and may thus become an important improvement regarding the translation of whole-parasite immunization toward a human malaria vaccine.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>32 (45), 6005-6011</Feld596><PubVol>32</PubVol><PubIss>45</PubIss><StrtPage>6005</StrtPage><EndPage>6011</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Pfeil J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Sepp KJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Heiss K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Meister M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Mueller AK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Borrmann S" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25203450</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.07.112</DOI><KST>D050</KST><KEYWORD>EFFICACY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMMUNITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHARMACOKINETICS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VACCINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHILDREN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>chloroquine</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PLASMODIUM-BERGHEI</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIVER STAGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIHYDROARTEMISININ-PIPERAQUINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>UNCOMPLICATED MALARIA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52525</publishedID><Artikel>Volumetry may predict early renal function after nephron sparing surgery in solitary kidney patients</Artikel><Journal>SpringerPlus</Journal><ABSTr>We investigate the impact of the residual kidney volume measured by tumor volumetry on preoperative imaging in predicting post-operative renal function. Nephron sparing surgery (NSS) in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the standard treatment for T1 kidney tumors. Resection of kidney tumors in solidary kidneys needs precise preoperative counseling of patients regarding post-operative renal function. Patients planned for renal tumor surgery who underwent prior nephrectomy on the contralateral side were included. We identified 35 patients in our database that underwent NSS in solitary kidneys and met the inclusion criteria. Tumor volumetry was performed on computer tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit (MITK). Clinical and pathological data were assessed. Follow-up data included renal function over 3 years. Mean age was 64 +/- 8.1 years. Mean tumor volume on imaging was 27.5 +/- 48.6 cc. Mean kidney volume was 195.2 +/- 62.8 cc and mean residual kidney volume was 173.4 +/- 65.3 cc. We found a correlation between renal function (MDRD) and residual kidney volume on imaging 1-week post-surgery (p = 0.038). Mid- and long-term renal function was not associated with residual kidney volume. In conclusion, renal volumetry may predict early renal function after NSS.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>3 (), Art. Nr.: 488-</Feld596><PubVol>3</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>Art.

Here, we investigated the roles of different CaMKII isoforms and splice variants in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury by the use of new genetic CaMKII mouse models. Although CaMKIIdeltaC was upregulated 1 day after I/R injury, cardiac damage 1 day after I/R was neither affected in CaMKIIdelta-deficient mice, CaMKIIdelta-deficient mice in which the splice variants CaMKIIdeltaB and C were re-expressed, nor in cardiomyocyte-specific CaMKIIdelta/gamma double knockout mice (DKO). In contrast, 5 weeks after I/R, DKO mice were protected against extensive scar formation and cardiac dysfunction, which was associated with reduced leukocyte infiltration and attenuated expression of members of the chemokine (C-C motif) ligand family, in particular CCL3 (macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, MIP-1alpha). Intriguingly, CaMKII was sufficient and required to induce CCL3 expression in isolated cardiomyocytes, indicating a cardiomyocyte autonomous effect. We propose that CaMKII-dependent chemoattractant signaling explains the effects on post-I/R remodeling. Taken together, we demonstrate that CaMKII is not critically involved in acute I/R-induced damage but in the process of post-infarct remodeling and inflammatory processes.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>6 (10), 1231-1245</Feld596><PubVol>6</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>1231</StrtPage><EndPage>1245</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Weinreuter M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Kreusser MM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Beckendorf J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schreiter FC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Leuschner F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Lehmann LH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Hofmann KP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Rostosky JS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Diemert N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Xu C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Volz HC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Jungmann A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Nickel A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Sticht C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Gretz N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Maack C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Schneider MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Groene HJ" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="18" name="Mueller OJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Katus HA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Backs J" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25193973</PMID><DOI>10.15252/emmm.201403848</DOI><KST>G130</KST><KEYWORD>PRESSURE-OVERLOAD</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INDEPENDENT ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INHIBITION PROTECTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEART-FAILURE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DEPENDENT PROTEIN-KINASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ISCHEMIA-REPERFUSION INJURY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CARDIAC-HYPERTROPHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSGENIC MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52528</publishedID><Artikel>A molecular signaling map and its application</Artikel><Journal>Cellular Signalling</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Cancer research over the past decades has revealed a number of molecular, biochemical, and cellular events that reflect progressive transformation of normal human cells into their malignant derivatives. These findings help to better understand the complexity of human tumorigenesis. RESULTS: In our study, molecular information is organized to chart a comprehensive map of the signaling network for human cancer. It includes transcriptional and translational regulation and diverse feedback-control loops. It is demonstrated that applying this signaling network map allows predicting the effect of targeted therapy before it can be applied into practice to reduce clinical trial risks. CONCLUSIONS: Hence, the proposed map with a prognosticating potential effect might become part of drug discovery programs for targeted therapy. Applied in individual patient care it helps to reduce the current reliance of cancer treatment on chemotherapies with low therapeutic indices. This study also demonstrates that continuing elucidation of tumorigenesis will not only need heterotypic organ culture systems in vitro and increasingly refined animal models in vivo, but also computationally calculable virtual cell models in silico.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>26 (12), 2834-2842</Feld596><PubVol>26</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>2834</StrtPage><EndPage>2842</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Li J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Mansmann UR" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25192909</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.cellsig.2014.08.022</DOI><KST>L701</KST></row><row><publishedID>52529</publishedID><Artikel>No evidence of gene-calcium interactions from genome-wide analysis of colorectal cancer risk</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers and Prevention</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (12), 2971-2976</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>2971</StrtPage><EndPage>2976</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Du M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Zhang X" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Hoffmeister M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schoen RE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Baron J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Berndt SI" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Carlson CS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Casey G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Chan AT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Curtis KR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Duggan D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Gauderman WJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Giovannucci EL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Gong J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Harrison TA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Hayes RB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Henderson BE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Hopper JL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Hsu L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Hudson TJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Hutter CM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Jenkins MA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Jiao S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Kocarnik JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Kolonel LN" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Le Marchand L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Lin Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Newcomb PA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Rudolph A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="30" name="Seminara D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Thornquist M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Ulrich CM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="33" name="White E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Wu K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Zanke BW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Campbell PT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Slattery ML" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Peters U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Chang-Claude J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="40" name="Potter JD" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25192705</PMID><KST>C020</KST><KST>C070</KST><KST>G110</KST></row><row><publishedID>52566</publishedID><Artikel>Colorectal cancers mimic structural organization of normal colonic crypts</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>Colonic crypts are stereotypical structures with distinct stem cell, proliferating, and differentiating compartments. Colorectal cancers derive from colonic crypt epithelia but, in contrast, form morphologically disarrayed glands. In this study, we investigated to which extent colorectal cancers phenocopy colonic crypt architecture and thus preserve structural organization of the normal intestinal epithelium. A subset of colon cancers showed crypt-like compartments with high WNT activity and nuclear beta-Catenin at the leading tumor edge, adjacent proliferation, and enhanced Cytokeratin 20 expression in most differentiated tumor epithelia of the tumor center. This architecture strongly depended on growth conditions, and was fully reproducible in mouse xenografts of cultured and primary colon cancer cells. Full crypt-like organization was associated with low tumor grade and was an independent prognostic marker of better survival in a collection of 221 colorectal cancers. Our findings suggest that full activation of preserved intestinal morphogenetic programs in colon cancer requires in vivo growth environments. Furthermore, crypt-like architecture was linked with less aggressive tumor biology, and may be useful to improve current colon cancer grading schemes.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (8), e104284-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>e104284</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Cernat L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Blaj C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Jackstadt R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Brandl L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Engel J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hermeking H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Jung A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Kirchner T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Horst D" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25111606</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0104284</DOI><KST>L701</KST><KEYWORD>proliferation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR PROGRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>microenvironment</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGNOSTIC-SIGNIFICANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STEM-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>beta-catenin</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>E-cadherin</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMORIGENESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WNT ACTIVITY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52567</publishedID><Artikel>Electrostatic effect of H1-histone protein binding on nucleosome repeat length</Artikel><Journal>Physical Biology</Journal><ABSTr>Within a simple biophysical model we describe the effect of electrostatic binding of H1 histone proteins on the nucleosome repeat length in chromatin. The length of wrapped DNA optimizes its binding energy to the histone core and the elastic energy penalty of DNA wrapping. The magnitude of the effect predicted from our model is in agreement with the systematic experimental data on the linear variation of nucleosome repeat lengths with H1/nucleosome ratio (Woodcock C L et al 2006 Chromos. Res. 14 17-25). We compare our model to the data for different cell types and organisms, with a widely varying ratio of bound H1 histones per nucleosome. We underline the importance of this non-specific histone-DNA charge-balance mechanism in regulating the positioning of nucleosomes and the degree of compaction of chromatin fibers in eukaryotic cells.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>11 (4), Art.

VEGF-A stimulates signal transduction pathways that modulate endothelial outputs such as cell migration, proliferation, tubulogenesis, and cell-cell interactions. Multiple VEGF-A isoforms exist, but the biological significance of this is unclear. Here we analyzed VEGF-A isoform-specific stimulation of VCAM-1 gene expression, which controls endothelial-leukocyte interactions, and show that this is dependent on both ERK1/2 and activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2). VEGF-A isoforms showed differential ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK phosphorylation kinetics. A key feature of VEGF-A isoform-specific ERK1/2 activation and nuclear translocation was increased phosphorylation of ATF-2 on threonine residue 71 (T71). Using reverse genetics, we showed ATF-2 to be functionally required for VEGF-A-stimulated endothelial VCAM-1 gene expression. ATF-2 knockdown blocked VEGF-A-stimulated VCAM-1 expression and endothelial-leukocyte interactions. ATF-2 was also required for other endothelial cell outputs, such as cell migration and tubulogenesis. In contrast, VCAM-1 was essential only for promoting endothelial-leukocyte interactions. This work presents a new paradigm for understanding how soluble growth factor isoforms program complex cellular outputs and responses by modulating signal transduction pathways.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>25 (16), 2509-2521</Feld596><PubVol>25</PubVol><PubIss>16</PubIss><StrtPage>2509</StrtPage><EndPage>2521</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Fearnley GW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Odell AF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Latham AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Mughal NA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Bruns AF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Burgoyne NJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Homer-Vanniasinkam S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Zachary IC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Hollstein MC" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Wheatcroft SB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Ponnambalam S" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24966171</PMID><DOI>10.1091/mbc.E14-05-0962</DOI><KST>C016</KST><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VITRO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH-FACTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANGIOGENESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>KINASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>KAPPA-B</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL-ADHESION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>E-SELECTIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR-GROWTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52569</publishedID><Artikel>Evidence of inappropriate cardiovascular risk assessment in middle-age women based on recommended cut-points for waist circumference</Artikel><Journal>Nutrition, Metabolism and Cardiovascular Diseases</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Diverse waist circumference thresholds for assessment of metabolic and cardiovascular risk in Caucasians are recommended by different health professional organizations. We aimed to determine optimal sex-specific thresholds for anthropometric measures showing the strongest association with cardiovascular risk factors in a cohort of middle-aged Germans. METHODS AND RESULTS: Statistical analyses are based on data from 426 mothers and 267 fathers of participants of the Ulm Birth Cohort Study undergoing a clinical follow-up examination in 2008 (median age 41 years) using logistic regression analyses. The prevalence of many cardiometabolic risk factors was significantly higher in men than in women; hypertension: 45%/17% (p &lt; 0.0001), apolipoprotein ratio B/A1 &gt; 0.72: 35%/9% (&lt;0.0001), hyperglycemia: 11%/14% (p = 0.3), which is in contrast to the predicted cardiovascular risk of 52%/70% and 24%/36% based on thresholds for waist circumference proposed by International Diabetes Federation and American Heart Association, respectively. We determined optimal thresholds for waist circumference between 90 and 95 cm for men and women. Using a threshold of 92 cm the prevalence of abdominal obesity was 59% in men and 24% in women, which was in agreement with the higher prevalence of overweight and obesity in men than in women (Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 25: 64%/35%). The prediction of cardiometabolic risk factors by waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio did not outperform the prediction by BMI. In contrast to BMI, waist circumference was correlated with body height independent of sex. CONCLUSION: Currently proposed thresholds for waist circumference spuriously overestimate the cardiovascular risk in women, but not in men in a German population.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>24 (10), 1112-1119</Feld596><PubVol>24</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>1112</StrtPage><EndPage>1119</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Florath I" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Brandt S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Weck MN" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Moss A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Gottmann P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Rothenbacher D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Wabitsch M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24932537</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.numecd.2014.04.005</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>APOLIPOPROTEIN-B</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BMI</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METAANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BODY-MASS INDEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>metabolic syndrome</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TO-HEIGHT RATIO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INDIVIDUALS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OBESITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POPULATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52570</publishedID><Artikel>Multifaceted effects of oligodendroglial exosomes on neurons: impact on neuronal firing rate, signal transduction and gene regulation</Artikel><Journal>Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society / B, Biological Sciences</Journal><ABSTr>Exosomes are small membranous vesicles of endocytic origin that are released by almost every cell type. They exert versatile functions in intercellular communication important for many physiological and pathological processes. Recently, exosomes attracted interest with regard to their role in cell-cell communication in the nervous system. We have shown that exosomes released from oligodendrocytes upon stimulation with the neurotransmitter glutamate are internalized by neurons and enhance the neuronal stress tolerance. Here, we demonstrate that oligodendroglial exosomes also promote neuronal survival during oxygen-glucose deprivation, a model of cerebral ischaemia. We show the transfer from oligodendrocytes to neurons of superoxide dismutase and catalase, enzymes which are known to help cells to resist oxidative stress. Additionally, we identify various effects of oligodendroglial exosomes on neuronal physiology. Electrophysiological analysis using in vitro multi-electrode arrays revealed an increased firing rate of neurons exposed to oligodendroglial exosomes. Moreover, gene expression analysis and phosphorylation arrays uncovered differentially expressed genes and altered signal transduction pathways in neurons after exosome treatment. Our study thus provides new insight into the broad spectrum of action of oligodendroglial exosomes and their effects on neuronal physiology.

We propose an experimental framework to assess such algorithms with respect to their ability to correctly represent well-defined physiological changes. We defined a set of clinically relevant ventilation conditions and induced them experimentally in 8 pigs by controlling three ventilator settings (tidal volume, positive end-expiratory pressure and the fraction of inspired oxygen). In this way, large and discrete shifts in global and regional lung air content were elicited. METHODS: We use the framework to compare twelve 2D EIT reconstruction algorithms, including backprojection (the original and still most frequently used algorithm), GREIT (a more recent consensus algorithm for lung imaging), truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD), several variants of the one-step Gauss-Newton approach and two iterative algorithms. We consider the effects of using a 3D finite element model, assuming non-uniform background conductivity, noise modeling, reconstructing for electrode movement, total variation (TV) reconstruction, robust error norms, smoothing priors, and using difference vs. normalized difference data. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that, while variation in appearance of images reconstructed from the same data is not negligible, clinically relevant parameters do not vary considerably among the advanced algorithms. Among the analysed algorithms, several advanced algorithms perform well, while some others are significantly worse. Given its vintage and ad-hoc formulation backprojection works surprisingly well, supporting the validity of previous studies in lung EIT.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (8), e103045-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>e103045</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Grychtol B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Elke G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Meybohm P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Weiler N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Frerichs I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Adler A" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25110887</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0103045</DOI><KST>E020</KST><KEYWORD>VENTILATION DISTRIBUTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ATELECTASIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RESPIRATORY-DISTRESS-SYNDROME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENERAL-ANESTHESIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>reconstruction algorithm</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REGULARIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONDUCTIVITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REGIONAL VENTILATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ELECTRICAL-IMPEDANCE TOMOGRAPHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52572</publishedID><Artikel>Monitoring protein misfolding by site-specific labeling of proteins in vivo</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>Incorporating fluorescent amino acids by suppression of the TAG amber codon is a useful tool for site-specific labeling of proteins and visualizing their localization in living cells. Here we use a plasmid encoded orthogonal tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase pair to site-specifically label firefly luciferase with the environmentally sensitive fluorescent amino acid, 3-(6-acetylnaphthalen-2-ylamino)-2- aminopropanoic acid (ANAP) and explore the detectability of conformational changes in labeled luciferase in the yeast cytoplasm. We find that ANAP labeling efficiency is greatly increased in [PSI+] cells and show that analysis of the ANAP fluorescence emission by confocal imaging allows for tracking the thermal unfolding and aggregation of luciferase in vivo. Furthermore we demonstrate that flow cytometry can be used to study conformational changes in luciferase and chaperone-mediated refolding in quantitative terms and at the level of single cells. This experimental setup for the first time allows for the direct analysis of the folding state of a protein in living cells and may serve as valuable new tool for examining mechanisms of protein folding, misfolding and aggregation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (6), e99395-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>e99395</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Hsieh TY" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Nillegoda NB" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Tyedmers J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Bukau B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Mogk A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Kramer G" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24915041</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0099395</DOI><KST>A250</KST><KEYWORD>SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FLUORESCENT-PROBE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52573</publishedID><Artikel>Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma and Atypical Glioblastoma: Multiparametric Differentiation by Using Diffusion-, Perfusion-, and Susceptibility-weighted MR Imaging</Artikel><Journal>Radiology</Journal><ABSTr>Purpose To compare multiparametric diagnostic performance with diffusion-weighted, dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast material-enhanced perfusion-weighted, and susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for differentiating primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and atypical glioblastoma. Materials and Methods This retrospective study was institutional review board-approved and informed consent was waived. Pretreatment MR imaging was performed in 314 patients with glioblastoma, and a subset of 28 patients with glioblastoma of atypical appearance (solid enhancement with no visible necrosis) was selected. Parameters of diffusion-weighted (apparent diffusion coefficient [ADC]), susceptibility-weighted (intratumoral susceptibility signals [ITSS]), and dynamic susceptibility-weighted contrast-enhanced perfusion-weighted (relative cerebral blood volume [rCBV]) imaging were evaluated in these 28 patients with glioblastoma and 19 immunocompetent patients with PCNSL. A two-sample t test and chi(2) test were used to compare parameters.The diagnostic performance for differentiating PCNSL from glioblastoma was evaluated by using logistic regression analyses with leave-one-out cross validation. Results Minimum, maximum, and mean ADCs and maximum and mean rCBVs were significantly lower in patients with PCNSL than in those with glioblastoma (P &lt; .01, respectively), whereas mean ADCs and mean rCBVs allowed the best diagnostic performance. Presence of ITSS was significantly lower in patients with PCNSL (32% [six of 19]) than in those with glioblastoma (82% [23 of 28]) (P &lt; .01). Multiparametric assessment of mean ADC, mean rCBV, and presence of ITSS significantly increased the probability for differentiating PCNSL and atypical glioblastoma compared with the evaluation of one or two imaging parameters (P &lt; .01), thereby correctly predicting histologic results in 95% (18 of 19) of patients with PCNSL and 96% (27 of 28) of patients with atypical glioblastoma. Conclusion Combined evaluation of mean ADC, mean rCBV, and presence of ITSS allowed reliable differentiation of PCNSL and atypical glioblastoma in most patients, and these results support an integration of advanced MR imaging techniques for the routine diagnostic workup of patients with these tumors.

Missense mutations in the MSH4 DNA repair gene (c.2480T&gt;A; p.I827N) were detected in three patients with gliomas (two anaplastic astrocytomas, two glioblastomas). Two family members without a TP53 germline mutation who developed peripheral schwannomas also carried the MSH4 germline mutation, and in addition, a germline mutation of the LATS1 gene (c.286C&gt;T; p.R96W). LATS1 is a downstream mediator of the NF2, but has not previously been found to be related to schwannomas. We therefore screened the entire coding sequence of the LATS1 gene in 65 sporadic schwannomas, 12 neurofibroma/schwannoma hybrid tumors, and 4 cases of schwannomatosis. We only found a single base deletion at codon 827 (exon 5) in a spinal schwannoma, leading to a stop at codon 835 (c.2480delG; p.*R827Kfs*8). Mutational loss of LATS1 function may thus play a role in some inherited schwannomas, but only exceptionally in sporadic schwannomas. This is the first study reporting a germline MSH4 mutation. Since it was present in all patients, it may have contributed to the subsequent acquisition of TP53 and LATS1 germline mutations.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>184 (9), 2374-2381</Feld596><PubVol>184</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>2374</StrtPage><EndPage>2381</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kim YH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Ohta T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Oh JE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Le Calvez-Kelm F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="McKay J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Voegele C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Durand G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Mittelbronn M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Kleihues P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Paulus W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Ohgaki H" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25041856</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.ajpath.2014.05.017</DOI><KST>L501</KST><KEYWORD>MISMATCH-REPAIR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VESTIBULAR SCHWANNOMAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHWAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>cell lines</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>microsatellite instability</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SPORADIC SCHWANNOMATOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTS HOMOLOGS HMSH4</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NF2 MUTATIONS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52575</publishedID><Artikel>pERK, pAKT and p53 as tissue biomarkers in erlotinib-treated patients with advanced pancreatic cancer: a translational subgroup analysis from AIO-PK0104</Artikel><Journal>BMC Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: The role of pERK, pAKT and p53 as biomarkers in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer has not yet been defined. METHODS: Within the phase III study AIO-PK0104 281 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer received an erlotinib-based 1st-line regimen. Archival tissue from 153 patients was available for central immunohistochemistry staining for pERK, pAKT and p53. Within a subgroup analysis, biomarker data were correlated with efficacy endpoints and skin rash using a Cox regression model. RESULTS: Fifty-five out of 153 patients were classified as pERKlow and 98 patients as pERKhigh; median overall survival (OS) was 6.2 months and 5.7 months, respectively (HR 1.29, p = 0.16). When analysing pERK as continuous variable, the pERK score was significantly associated with OS (HR 1.06, 95% CI 1.0-1.12, p = 0.05). Twenty-one of 35 patients were pAKTlow and 14/35 pAKThigh with a corresponding median OS of 6.4 months and 6.8 months, respectively (HR 1.03, p = 0.93). Four out of 50 patients had a complete loss of p53 expression, 20 patients a regular expression and 26 patients had tumors with p53 overexpression. The p53 status had no impact on OS (p = 0.91); however, a significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) (6.0 vs 1.8 months, HR 0.24, p = 0.02) and a higher rate of skin rash (84% vs 25%, p = 0.02) was observed for patients with a regular p53 expression compared to patients with a complete loss of p53. CONCLUSION: pERK expression may have an impact on OS in erlotinib-treated patients with advanced pancreatic cancer; p53 should be further investigated for its potential role as a predictive marker for PFS and skin rash.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the information provided by three dimensional NOE mediated CEST at 7 Tesla (7T) and standard MRI in glioblastoma patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twelve patients with newly diagnosed histologically proven glioblastoma were enrolled in this prospective ethics committee-approved study. NOE mediated CEST contrast was acquired with a modified three-dimensional gradient-echo sequence and asymmetry analysis was conducted at 3.3 ppm (B1 = 0.7 microT) to calculate the magnetization transfer ratio asymmetry (MTR(asym)). Contrast enhanced T1 (CE-T1) and T2-weighted images were acquired at 3T and used for data co-registration and comparison. RESULTS: Mean NOE mediated CEST signal based on MTR(asym) values over all patients was significantly increased (p&lt;0.001) in CE-T1 tumor (-1.99 +/- 1.22%), tumor necrosis (-1.36 +/- 1.30%) and peritumoral CEST hyperintensities (PTCH) within T2 edema margins (-3.56 +/- 1.24%) compared to contralateral normal appearing white matter (-8.38 +/- 1.19%). In CE-T1 tumor (p = 0.015) and tumor necrosis (p&lt;0.001) mean MTR(asym) values were significantly higher than in PTCH. Extent of the surrounding tumor hyperintensity was smaller in eight out of 12 patients on CEST than on T2-weighted images, while four displayed at equal size. In all patients, isolated high intensity regions (0.40 +/- 2.21%) displayed on CEST within the CE-T1 tumor that were not discernible on CE-T1 or T2-weighted images. CONCLUSION: NOE mediated CEST Imaging at 7 T provides additional information on the structure of peritumoral hyperintensities in glioblastoma and displays isolated high intensity regions within the CE-T1 tumor that cannot be acquired on CE-T1 or T2-weighted images. Further research is needed to determine the origin of NOE mediated CEST and possible clinical applications such as therapy assessment or biopsy planning.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (8), e104181-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>e104181</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Paech D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Zaiss M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Meissner JE" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Windschuh J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Wiestler B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Bachert P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Neumann JO" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Kickingereder P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Schlemmer HP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Wick W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Nagel AM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Heiland S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Ladd ME" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Bendszus M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Radbruch A" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25111650</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0104181</DOI><KST>E010</KST><KST>E020</KST><KST>G370</KST><KST>E012</KST><KEYWORD>BRAIN-TUMORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CRITERIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSFER CEST</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MAGNETIZATION-TRANSFER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MRI</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONTRAST</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PEPTIDES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THERAPEUTIC RESPONSE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52577</publishedID><Artikel>Transient ablation of regulatory T cells improves antitumor immunity in colitis-associated colon cancer</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Research</Journal><ABSTr>Regulatory T cells (Treg) are supportive to cancer development in most tissues, but their role in colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC) remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of CD4(+)Foxp3(+) Treg in a mouse model of CAC and in patients with colon cancer. These Treg were increased strongly in number in a mouse model of CAC and in the peripheral blood of patients with colon cancer, exhibiting an activated phenotype as defined by elevated expression of GARP, CD103, CTLA-4, and IL10, along with an increased suppressive effect on the proliferation and Th1 cytokine expression of CD4(+)CD25(-) responder T cells ex vivo. Transient ablation of CD4(+)Foxp3(+) Treg during tumor development in the CAC model suppressed tumor outgrowth and distribution, accompanied by an increased number of CD8(+)IFNgamma/granzyme B-producing effector T cells. Conversely, inactivation of IL10 in Treg did not elevate the antitumor response but instead further boosted tumor development. Our results establish a tumor-promoting function for Treg during CAC formation, but they also suggest that a selective, transient ablation of Treg can evoke antitumor responses, with implications for immunotherapeutic interventions in patients with CAC.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>74 (16), 4258-4269</Feld596><PubVol>74</PubVol><PubIss>16</PubIss><StrtPage>4258</StrtPage><EndPage>4269</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Pastille E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Bardini K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Fleissner D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Adamczyk A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Frede A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Wadwa M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="von Smolinski D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Kasper S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Sparwasser T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Gruber AD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Schuler M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Sakaguchi S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Roers A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Mueller W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Hansen W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Buer J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Westendorf AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24906621</PMID><DOI>10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-3065</DOI><KST>L401</KST><KEYWORD>EFFECTOR/MEMORY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>prognosis</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTERLEUKIN-10</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FOXP3</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INFLAMMATORY-BOWEL-DISEASE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52578</publishedID><Artikel>Monitoring cardiac motion in CT using a continuous wave radar embedded in the patient table</Artikel><Journal>Medical Physics</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: To avoid motion artifacts, medical imaging devices are often synchronized with the patient's cardiac motion. Today, the ECG is used to determine the heartbeat and therewith trigger the imaging device. However, the ECG requires additional effort to prepare the patient, e.g., mount and wire electrodes and it is not able to determine the motion of the heart. An interesting alternative to assess the cardiac motion is continuous wave radar. The aim of this work is to evaluate such a radar system focusing on measuring the cardiac motion. METHODS: A radar system operating in the 860 MHz band is used. In the intended application of the radar system, the antennas are located close to the patient's body, for example, inside the table of a CT system. The radar waves propagate into the patient's body and are reflected at tissue boundaries, for example, at the borderline between muscle and adipose tissue, or at the boundaries of organs. Here, the authors focus on the detection of cardiac motion. The radar system consists of hardware as well as of dedicated signal processing software to extract the desired information from the radar signals. The radar system hardware and the signal processing algorithms were tested with data from ten volunteers. As a reference, the ECG was recorded simultaneously with the radar measurements. Additionally, ultrasound measurements are performed and compared with the motion information from the radar data. RESULTS: According to the authors' measurements on volunteers (test persons), the heartbeat and heart rate can be detected well using the proposed radar system. The authors were further able to extract the amplitude and phase of the heart motion itself from the radar data. This was confirmed by the ultrasound measurements. However, this motion assessment is dependent on the antenna position and it remains unclear which antenna sees the motion that is the most relevant to CT imaging. CONCLUSIONS: A continuous wave radar operating in the near field of the antennas can be used to determine the heartbeat and the cardiac motion of humans without special patient preparation. The authors' radar system is very close to the patient because it is embedded in the patient table, but it has no direct contact to the patient or to the patient skin (as it would be necessary to acquire the ECG of the patient). Therefore, radar motion monitoring does not require special patient preparation. In contrast to other methods used today, this is a significant improvement. The authors' radar system may allow to trigger a CT scan in dependency of the cardiac phase, without requiring an ECG, and it allows to determine quiet, and thus favorable, heart phases prior to the scan start.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>41 (8), Art.

METHODS: Between 2007 and 2013, 27 patients (pts) with primary/recurrent retroperitoneal sarcomas (size &gt; 5 cm, M0, at least marginally resectable) were enrolled. The protocol attempted neoadjuvant IMRT using an integrated boost with doses of 45-50 Gy to PTV and 50-56 Gy to GTV in 25 fractions, followed by surgery and IOERT (10-12 Gy). Primary endpoint was 5-year-LC, secondary endpoints included PFS, OS, resectability, and acute/late toxicity. The majority of patients showed high grade lesions (FNCLCC G1:18%, G2:52%, G3:30%), predominantly liposarcomas (70%). Median tumor size was 15 cm (6-31). RESULTS: Median follow-up was 33 months (5-75). Neoadjuvant IMRT was performed as planned (median dose 50 Gy, 26-55) in all except 2 pts (93%). Gross total resection was feasible in all except one patient. Final margin status was R0 in 6 (22%) and R1 in 20 pts (74%). Contiguous-organ resection was needed in all grossly resected patients. IOERT was performed in 23 pts (85%) with a median dose of 12 Gy (10-20 Gy).We observed 7 local recurrences, transferring into estimated 3- and 5-year-LC rates of 72%. Two were located outside the EBRT area and two were observed after more than 5 years. Locally recurrent situation had a significantly negative impact on local control. Distant failure was found in 8 pts, resulting in 3- and 5-year-DC rates of 63%. Patients with leiomyosarcoma had a significantly increased risk of distant failure. Estimated 3- and 5-year-rates were 40% for PFS and 74% for OS. Severe acute toxicity (grade 3) was present in 4 pts (15%). Severe postoperative complications were found in 9 pts (33%), of whom 2 finally died after multiple re-interventions. Severe late toxicity (grade 3) was scored in 6% of surviving patients after 1 year and none after 2 years. CONCLUSION: Combination of neoadjuvant IMRT, surgery and IOERT is feasible with acceptable toxicity and yields good results in terms of LC and OS in patients with high-risk retroperitoneal sarcomas. Long term follow-up seems mandatory given the observation of late recurrences. Accrual of patients will be continued with extended follow-up.

To address this challenge in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), one of the deadliest and most common cancers in the world, we developed and validated an inducible model of hepatocarcinogenesis in adult mice. Tumorigenesis was triggered by intravenous adenoviral delivery of Cre recombinase in transgenic mice expressing the hepatocyte-specific albumin promoter, a loxP-flanked stop cassette, and the SV40 large T-antigen (iAST). Cre recombinase-mediated excision of the stop cassette led to a transient viral hepatitis and resulted in multinodular tumorigenesis within 5 to 8 weeks. Tumor nodules with histologic characteristics of human HCC established a functional vasculature by cooption, remodeling, and angiogenic expansion of the preexisting sinusoidal liver vasculature with increasing signs of vascular immaturity during tumor progression. Treatment of mice with sorafenib rapidly resulted in the induction of vascular regression, inhibition of tumor growth, and enhanced overall survival. Vascular regression was characterized by loss of endothelial cells leaving behind avascular type IV collagen-positive empty sleeves with remaining pericytes. Sorafenib treatment led to transcriptional changes of Igf1, Id1, and cMet over time, which may reflect the emergence of potential escape mechanisms. Taken together, our results established the iAST model of inducible hepatocarcinogenesis as a robust and versatile preclinical model to study HCC progression and validate novel therapies.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>74 (15), 4157-4169</Feld596><PubVol>74</PubVol><PubIss>15</PubIss><StrtPage>4157</StrtPage><EndPage>4169</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Runge A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Hu J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Wieland M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Bergeest JP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Mogler C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Neumann A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Geraud C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Arnold B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Rohr K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Komljenovic D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Schirmacher P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Goerdt S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Augustin HG" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24906623</PMID><DOI>10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-2311</DOI><KST>E020</KST><KST>D050</KST><KST>B080</KST><KST>A190</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>TUMOR VASCULATURE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOUSE MODELS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIVER-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RAF/MEK/ERK PATHWAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSGENIC MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANGIOGENESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH-FACTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MICROVESSEL DENSITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MULTIKINASE INHIBITOR</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52582</publishedID><Artikel>Prognostic Impact of Bcl-2 Depends on Tumor Histology and Expression of MALAT-1 lncRNA in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Thoracic Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>INTRODUCTION: Apoptosis is a crucial pathway in tumor growth and metastatic development. Apoptotic proteins regulate the underlying molecular cascades and are thought to modulate the tumor response to chemotherapy and radiation. However, the prognostic value of the expression of apoptosis regulators in localized non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still unclear. METHODS: We investigated the protein expression of apoptosis regulators Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, Mcl-1, and pp32/PHAPI, and the expression of the lncRNA MALAT-1 in tumor samples from 383 NSCLC patients (median age: 65.6 years; 77.5% male; paraffin-embedded tissue microarrays). For statistical analysis correlation tests, Log rank tests and Cox proportional hazard models were applied. RESULTS: Tumor histology was significantly associated with the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xl and Mcl-1 (all p &lt; 0.001). Among the tested apoptotic markers only Bcl-2 demonstrated prognostic impact (hazard ratio = 0.64, p = 0.012). For NSCLC patients with non-adenocarcinoma histology, Bcl-2 expression was associated with increased overall survival (p = 0.036). Besides tumor histology, prognostic impact of Bcl-2 was also found to depend on MALAT-1 lncRNA expression. Gene expression analysis of A549 adenocarcinoma cells with differential MALAT-1 lncRNA expression demonstrated an influence on the expression of Bcl-2 and its interacting proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Bcl-2 expression was specifically associated with superior prognosis in localized NSCLC. An interaction of Bcl-2 with MALAT-1 lncRNA expression was revealed, which merits further investigation for risk prediction in resectable NSCLC patients.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (9), 1294-1304</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>1294</StrtPage><EndPage>1304</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schmidt LH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Gorlich D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Spieker T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Rohde C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schuler M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Mohr M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Humberg J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Sauer T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Thoenissen NH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Huge A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Voss R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Marra A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Faldum A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Muller-Tidow C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Berdel WE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Wiewrodt R" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25036876</PMID><KST>L401</KST><KEYWORD>X-L</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>carcinoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>APOPTOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BIOLOGICAL NETWORKS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Bcl-x(L)</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FAMILY-MEMBERS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52583</publishedID><Artikel>Hypothalamic miR-103 protects from hyperphagic obesity in mice</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Neuroscience</Journal><ABSTr>The role of neuronal noncoding RNAs in energy control of the body is not fully understood. The arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus comprises neurons regulating food intake and body weight. Here we show that Dicer-dependent loss of microRNAs in these neurons of adult (DicerCKO) mice causes chronic overactivation of the signaling pathways involving phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and an imbalance in the levels of neuropeptides, resulting in severe hyperphagic obesity. Similarly, the activation of PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway due to Pten deletion in the adult forebrain leads to comparable weight increase. Conversely, the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin normalizes obesity in mice with an inactivated Dicer1 or Pten gene. Importantly, the continuous delivery of oligonucleotides mimicking microRNAs, which are predicted to target PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway components, to the hypothalamus attenuates adiposity in DicerCKO mice. Furthermore, loss of miR-103 causes strong upregulation of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway in vitro and its application into the ARC of the Dicer-deficient mice both reverses upregulation of Pik3cg, the mRNA encoding the catalytic subunit p110gamma of the PI3K complex, and attenuates the hyperphagic obesity. Our data demonstrate in vivo the crucial role of neuronal microRNAs in the control of energy homeostasis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>34 (32), 10659-10674</Feld596><PubVol>34</PubVol><PubIss>32</PubIss><StrtPage>10659</StrtPage><EndPage>10674</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Vinnikov IA" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Hajdukiewicz K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Reymann J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Beneke J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Czajkowski R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Roth LC" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Novak M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Roller A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Doerner N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Starkuviene V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Theis FJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Erfle H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Schuetz G" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Grinevich V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Konopka W" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25100599</PMID><DOI>10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4251-13.2014</DOI><KST>A992</KST><KST>V078</KST><KEYWORD>NEUROPEPTIDE-Y</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INSULIN-RESISTANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FOOD-INTAKE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADIPOSE-TISSUE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LONG-TERM DEPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>mTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BODY-WEIGHT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMPAIRS GLUCOSE-METABOLISM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LEPTIN ACTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POMC NEURONS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52584</publishedID><Artikel>A Coding IRAK2 Protein Variant Compromises Toll-like receptor (TLR) Signaling and Is Associated with Colorectal Cancer Survival</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Biological Chemistry</Journal><ABSTr>Within innate immune signaling pathways, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs) fulfill key roles downstream of multiple Toll-like receptors and the interleukin-1 receptor. Although human IRAK4 deficiency was shown to lead to severe immunodeficiency in response to pyogenic bacterial infection during childhood, little is known about the role of human IRAK2. We here identified a non-synonymous IRAK2 variant, rs35060588 (coding R214G), as hypofunctional in terms of NF-kappaB signaling and Toll-like receptor-mediated cytokine induction. This was due to reduced ubiquitination of TRAF6, a key step in signal transduction. IRAK2 rs35060588 occurs in 3-9% of individuals in different ethnic groups, and our studies suggested a genetic association of rs35060588 with colorectal cancer survival. This for the first time implicates human IRAK2 in a human disease and highlights the R214G IRAK2 variant as a potential novel and broadly applicable biomarker for disease or as a therapeutic intervention point.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>289 (33), 23123-23131</Feld596><PubVol>289</PubVol><PubIss>33</PubIss><StrtPage>23123</StrtPage><EndPage>23131</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Wang H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Flannery SM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Dickhofer S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Huhn S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="George J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Kubarenko AV" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Lascorz J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Bevier M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Willemsen J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Pichulik T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Schafmayer C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Binder M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Manoury B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Paludan SR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Alarcon-Riquelme M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Bowie AG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Foersti A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="17" name="Weber AN" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24973222</PMID><DOI>10.1074/jbc.M113.492934</DOI><KST>C050</KST><KEYWORD>FAMILY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMPLEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RESPONSES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MEMBER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>KINASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REGULATOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>KAPPA-B</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MYD88 DEFICIENCY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INHIBITORS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52585</publishedID><Artikel>Effects of long-term acupuncture treatment on resting-state brain activity in migraine patients: a randomized controlled trial on active acupoints and inactive acupoints</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Acupuncture has been commonly used for preventing migraine attacks and relieving pain during a migraine, although there is limited knowledge on the physiological mechanism behind this method. The objectives of this study were to compare the differences in brain activities evoked by active acupoints and inactive acupoints and to investigate the possible correlation between clinical variables and brain responses. METHODS AND RESULTS: A randomized controlled trial and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were conducted. A total of eighty migraineurs without aura were enrolled to receive either active acupoint acupuncture or inactive acupoint acupuncture treatment for 8 weeks, and twenty patients in each group were randomly selected for the fMRI scan at the end of baseline and at the end of treatment. The neuroimaging data indicated that long-term active acupoint therapy elicited a more extensive and remarkable cerebral response compared with acupuncture at inactive acupoints. Most of the regions were involved in the pain matrix, lateral pain system, medial pain system, default mode network, and cognitive components of pain processing. Correlation analysis showed that the decrease in the visual analogue scale (VAS) was significantly related to the increased average Regional homogeneity (ReHo) values in the anterior cingulate cortex in the two groups. Moreover, the decrease in the VAS was associated with increased average ReHo values in the insula which could be detected in the active acupoint group. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term active acupoint therapy and inactive acupoint therapy have different brain activities. We postulate that acupuncture at the active acupoint might have the potential effect of regulating some disease-affected key regions and the pain circuitry for migraine, and promote establishing psychophysical pain homeostasis.

Integration of these data with the wealth of information derived from cancer genome profiling studies performed by large international consortia has provided novel insights into the cellular aberrations that contribute to cancer development. There is evidence that genetic mutations in epigenetic regulators (such as DNMT3, IDH1/2 or H3.3) mediate or contribute to these patterns, although a unifying molecular mechanism underlying the global alterations of DNA methylation has largely been elusive. Knowledge gained from pan-cancer methylome analyses will aid the development of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, improve patient stratification and the discovery of novel druggable targets for therapy, and will generate hypotheses for innovative clinical trial designs based on methylation subgroups rather than on cancer subtypes. In this review, we discuss recent advances in the global profiling of tumor genomes for aberrant DNA methylation and the integration of these data with cancer genome profiling data, highlight potential mechanisms leading to different methylation subgroups, and show how this information can be used in basic research and for translational applications. A remaining challenge is to experimentally prove the functional link between observed pan-cancer methylation patterns, the associated genetic aberrations, and their relevance for the development of cancer.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>6 (), -</Feld596><PubVol>6</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage/><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Witte,T."

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of inflammation with the development of renal failure in a cohort of the elderly general population. METHODS: After excluding subjects with reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR&lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2) and missing data, the cohort incorporated 785 men and 659 women (aged 45-83 years). Follow-up was performed four years after baseline. Covariate adjusted linear and logistic regression models were used to assess the association of plasma/serum concentrations of soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 (sTNF-R1), C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) with change in eGFR/creatinine. The areas under the curve (AUCs) from receiver operating characteristics (ROCs) were estimated. RESULTS: In adjusted models sTNF-R1 was distinctively associated with a decline in eGFR in men (0.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 per 100 pg/mL sTNF-R1; 95% CI: 0.4-0.8), but not in women. A similar association could not be found for CRP or IL-6. Estimates of sTNF-R1 in the cross-sectional analyses were similar between sexes, while CRP and IL-6 were not relevantly associated with eGFR/creatinine. CONCLUSION: In the elderly male general population with preserved renal function sTNF-R1 predicts the development of renal failure.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (9), e108427-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>e108427</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Medenwald D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Girndt M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Loppnow H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kluttig A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Nuding S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Tiller D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Thiery JJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Greiser KH" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Haerting J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Werdan K" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25259714</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0108427</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>INJURY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TNF-ALPHA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHRONIC KIDNEY-DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EQUATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CREATININE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>cross-sectional analysis</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEART</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NECROSIS-FACTOR-ALPHA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MARKERS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52615</publishedID><Artikel>No evidence of oncogenic KRAS mutations in squamous cell carcinomas of the anogenital tract and head and neck region independent of human papillomavirus and p16(INK4a) status</Artikel><Journal>Human Pathology</Journal><ABSTr>Carcinogenesis of squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) in the anogenital tract and head and neck region is heterogeneous. A substantial proportion of SCC in the vulva, anus, and head and neck follows a human papillomavirus (HPV)-induced carcinogenic pathway. However, the molecular pathways of carcinogenesis in the HPV-independent lesions are not completely understood. We hypothesized that oncogenic Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutations might represent a carcinogenic mechanism in a proportion of those HPV-negative cancers. Considering the repeated observation of KRAS-associated p16INK4a overexpression in human tumors, it was assumed that KRAS mutations might be particularly present in the group of HPV-negative, p16INK4a-positive cancers. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed 66 anal, vulvar, and head and neck SCC with known immunohistochemical p16INK4a and HPV DNA status for KRAS mutations in exon 2 (codons 12, 13, and 15). We enriched the tumor collection with HPV DNA-negative, p16INK4a-positive cancers. A subset of 37 cancers was also analyzed for mutations in the B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) gene. None of the 66 tumors harbored mutations in KRAS exon 2, thus excluding KRAS mutations as a common event in SCC of the anogenital and head and neck region and as a cause of p16INK4a expression in these tumors. In addition, no BRAF mutations were detected in the 37 analyzed tumors. Further studies are required to determine the molecular events underlying HPV-negative anal, vulvar, and head and neck carcinogenesis. Considering HPV-independent p16INK4a overexpression in some of these tumors, particular focus should be placed on alternative upstream activators and potential downstream disruption of the p16INK4a pathway.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>45 (11), 2347-2354</Feld596><PubVol>45</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>2347</StrtPage><EndPage>2354</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Prigge ES" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Urban K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Stiegler S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Mueller M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kloor M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Mai S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Ottstadt M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Lohr F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Wenz F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Wagner S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Wittekindt C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Klussmann JP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Hampl M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="von Knebel Doeberitz M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="14" name="Reuschenbach M" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25257576</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.humpath.2014.08.001</DOI><KST>G105</KST><KEYWORD>p53</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOLECULAR-BIOLOGY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HIGH-FREQUENCY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Ras</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>p16(INK4A)</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>senescence</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52617</publishedID><Artikel>Characterizing Protein Interactions Employing a Genome-Wide siRNA Cellular Phenotyping Screen.</Artikel><Journal>PloS Computational Biology</Journal><ABSTr>Characterizing the activating and inhibiting effect of protein-protein interactions (PPI) is fundamental to gain insight into the complex signaling system of a human cell. A plethora of methods has been suggested to infer PPI from data on a large scale, but none of them is able to characterize the effect of this interaction. Here, we present a novel computational development that employs mitotic phenotypes of a genome-wide RNAi knockdown screen and enables identifying the activating and inhibiting effects of PPIs. Exemplarily, we applied our technique to a knockdown screen of HeLa cells cultivated at standard conditions. Using a machine learning approach, we obtained high accuracy (82% AUC of the receiver operating characteristics) by cross-validation using 6,870 known activating and inhibiting PPIs as gold standard. We predicted de novo unknown activating and inhibiting effects for 1,954 PPIs in HeLa cells covering the ten major signaling pathways of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and made these predictions publicly available in a database. We finally demonstrate that the predicted effects can be used to cluster knockdown genes of similar biological processes in coherent subgroups. The characterization of the activating or inhibiting effect of individual PPIs opens up new perspectives for the interpretation of large datasets of PPIs and thus considerably increases the value of PPIs as an integrated resource for studying the detailed function of signaling pathways of the cellular system of interest.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>10 (9), e1003814-</Feld596><PubVol>10</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>e1003814</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Suratanee A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Schaefer MH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Betts MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Soons Z" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Mannsperger H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Harder N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Oswald M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Gipp M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Ramminger E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Marcus G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Manner R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Rohr K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Wanker E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Russell RB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Andrade-Navarro MA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Eils R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="16" name="Koenig R" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25255318</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003814</DOI><KST>B080</KST><KEYWORD>INTERACTION NETWORK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHWAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CLASSIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SIGNAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DATABASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTERFACE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PACKAGE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52618</publishedID><Artikel>A sphingosine kinase inhibitor combined with temozolomide induces glioblastoma cell death through accumulation of dihydrosphingosine and dihydroceramide, endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy</Artikel><Journal>Cell Death and Disease</Journal><ABSTr>Glioblastomas (GBMs) are very aggressive tumors with low chemosensitivity. The DNA-alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) is currently the most efficient chemotoxic drug for GBM therapy; however, many patients develop resistance to TMZ. Combining TMZ with another agent could present an improved treatment option if it could overcome TMZ resistance and avoid side effects. Sphingosine kinase inhibitors (SKIs) have emerged as anticancer agents. Sphingosine kinases are often overexpressed in tumors where their activity of phosphorylating sphingosine (Sph) contributes to tumor growth and migration. They control the levels of the pro-apoptotic ceramide (Cer) and Sph and of the pro-survival sphingosine-1 phosphate. In the present work, TMZ was combined with a specific SKI, and the cytotoxic effect of each drug alone or in combination was tested on GBM cell lines. The combination of sublethal doses of both agents resulted in the cell death potentiation of GBM cell lines without affecting astrocyte viability. It triggered a caspase-3-dependent cell death that was preceded by accumulation of dihydrosphingosine (dhSph) and dihydroceramide (dhCer), oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and autophagy. Autophagy was identified as the crucial switch that facilitated induction of this cell death potentiation. The sublethal dose of the inhibitor induced these stress events, whereas that of TMZ induced the destructive autophagy switch. Remarkably, neither Cer nor Sph, but rather the Cer intermediates, dhSph and dhCer, was involved in the cytotoxicity from the combination. Cell lines sensitive to the combination expressed low levels of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase-1, indicating this enzyme as a potential marker of sensitivity to such treatment. This work shows for the first time a strong interaction between a SKI and TMZ, leading to a tumor cell-specific death induction. It further demonstrates the biological relevance of dihydrosphingolipids in cell death mechanisms and emphasizes the potential of drugs that affect sphingolipid metabolism for cancer therapy.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>5 (), e1425-</Feld596><PubVol>5</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>e1425</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Noack J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Choi J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Richter K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kopp-Schneider A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Regnier-Vigouroux A" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25255218</PMID><DOI>10.1038/cddis.2014.384</DOI><KST>C060</KST><KEYWORD>SPHINGOSINE-1-PHOSPHATE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OXIDATIVE STRESS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SIGNALING PATHWAYS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INDUCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ER STRESS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MALIGNANT GLIOMA-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SERINE PALMITOYLTRANSFERASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>unfolded protein response</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLUTATHIONE-PEROXIDASE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52619</publishedID><Artikel>Novel RNA Markers in Prostate Cancer: Functional Considerations and Clinical Translation</Artikel><Journal>BioMed Research International</Journal><ABSTr>The availability of ultra-high throughput DNA and RNA sequencing technologies in recent years has led to the identification of numerous novel transcripts, whose functions are unknown as yet. Evidence is accumulating that many of these molecules are deregulated in diseases, including prostate cancer, and potentially represent novel targets for diagnosis and therapy. In particular, functional genomic analysis of microRNA (miRNA) and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) in cancer is likely to contribute insights into tumor development. Here, we compile recent efforts to catalog differential expression of miRNA and lncRNA in prostate cancer and to understand RNA function in tumor progression. We further highlight technologies for molecular characterization of noncoding RNAs and provide an overview of current activities to exploit them for the diagnosis and therapy of this complex tumor.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>2014 (), 765207-</Feld596><PubVol>2014</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>765207</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Pickl JM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Heckmann D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Ratz L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Klauck SM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Sueltmann H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25250334</PMID><KST>B063</KST></row><row><publishedID>52620</publishedID><Artikel>Transcription factors Foxa1 and Foxa2 are required for adult dopamine neurons maintenance</Artikel><Journal>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience</Journal><ABSTr>The proteins Foxa1 and Foxa2 belong to the forkhead family of transcription factors and are involved in the development of several tissues, including liver, pancreas, lung, prostate, and the neural system. Both Foxa1 and Foxa2 are also crucial for the specification and differentiation of dopamine (DA) neurons during embryonic development, while about 30% of mice with an embryonic deletion of a single allele of the Foxa2 gene exhibit an age-related asymmetric loss of DA neurons and develop locomotor symptoms resembling Parkinson's disease (PD). Notably, both Foxa1 and Foxa2 factors continue to be expressed in the adult dopamine system. To directly assess their functions selectively in adult DA neurons, we induced genetic deletions of Foxa1/2 transcription factors in mice using a tamoxifen inducible tissue-specific CreERT2 recombinase expressed under control of the dopamine transporter (DAT) promoter (DATCreERT2). The conditional DA neurons-specific ablation of both genes, but not of Foxa2 alone, in early adulthood, caused a decline of striatal dopamine and its metabolites, along with locomotor deficits. At early pre-symptomatic stages, we observed a decline in aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1, subfamily A1 (Aldh1a1) protein expression in DA neurons. Further analyses revealed a decline of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) and a complete loss of DAT expression in these neurons. These molecular changes ultimately led to a reduction of DA neuron numbers in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) of aged cFoxa1/2 (-/-) mice, resembling the progressive course of PD in humans. Altogether, in this study, we address the molecular, cellular, and functional role of both Foxa1 and Foxa2 factors in the maintenance of the adult dopamine system which may help to find better approaches for PD treatment.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>8 (), Art.

Tissue macrophages can be derived from embryonic progenitors or from monocytes during inflammation. We report that within the first weeks after birth, the embryo-derived population of resident CX3CR1+ cMPhi diversifies into MHCII+ and MHCII- cells. Genetic fate mapping demonstrated that cMPhi derived from CX3CR1+ embryonic progenitors persisted into adulthood but the initially high contribution to resident cMPhi declined after birth. Consistent with this, the early significant proliferation rate of resident cMPhi decreased with age upon diversification into subpopulations. Bone marrow (BM) reconstitution experiments showed monocyte-dependent quantitative replacement of all cMPhi populations. Furthermore, parabiotic mice and BM chimeras of nonirradiated recipient mice revealed a slow but significant donor contribution to cMPhi. Together, our observations indicate that in the heart, embryo-derived cMPhi show declining self-renewal with age and are progressively substituted by monocyte-derived macrophages, even in the absence of inflammation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>211 (11), 2151-2158</Feld596><PubVol>211</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>2151</StrtPage><EndPage>2158</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Molawi K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Wolf Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kandalla PK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Favret J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Hagemeyer N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Frenzel K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Pinto AR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Klapproth K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Henri S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Malissen B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Rodewald HR" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Rosenthal NA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Bajenoff M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Prinz M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Jung S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Sieweke MH" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25245760</PMID><KST>D110</KST></row><row><publishedID>52625</publishedID><Artikel>Novel DNA methylation targets in oral rinse samples predict survival of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma</Artikel><Journal>Oral Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to identify novel survival-associated biomarkers in oral rinse samples collected from patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We screened for putative survival-associated markers using publicly available methylation array data from 88 OSCC tumors. Cox models were then fit to methylation array data restricted to these putative loci in oral rinse samples of 82 OSCC patients from greater Boston. Pyrosequencing assays were designed for each locus that replicated in the oral rinse samples and applied to a validation set of oral rinse samples from another 61 OSCC patients. RESULTS: We identified 7 survival-associated methylation markers in oral rinse samples from OSCC patients, and have validated one, located in the body of GABBR1, by pyrosequencing. CONCLUSION: The 7 CpG loci identified through this study represent novel prognostic biomarkers for patients with OSCC that can be detected using a non-invasive oral rinse collection technique.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>50 (11), 1072-1080</Feld596><PubVol>50</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>1072</StrtPage><EndPage>1080</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Langevin SM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Butler RA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Eliot M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Pawlita M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Maccani JZ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="McClean MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Kelsey KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25242135</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.oraloncology.2014.08</DOI><KST>F020</KST><KEYWORD>GENE PROMOTER HYPERMETHYLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SALIVARY RINSES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BODY-FLUIDS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OPCML</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IDENTIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEAD</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>tumor</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CPG ISLAND SHORES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NECK-CANCER</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52627</publishedID><Artikel>Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase sensitizes lung cancer cells and H1299 xenografts to erlotinib</Artikel><Journal>Lung Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>OBJECTIVES: The therapeutic scheme for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients can be improved if adapted to the individual response. For example, 60-70% of adenocarcinoma patients show response to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the presence of mutated EGFR. We searched for additional target molecules involved in the action of the EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib in the absence of EGFR mutations, which might be suitable for combinatorial therapy approaches. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Erlotinib-response associated proteins were investigated in patient-derived NSCLC mouse xenografts by reverse-phase protein array technology (RPPA) and Western blotting. A combinatorial treatment approach was carried out in NSCLC cell lines and H1299 mouse xenografts, and subsequently analyzed for consequences in cell growth and signal transduction. RESULTS: AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) expression was increased in erlotinib responders before and after treatment. In a combinatorial approach, activation of AMPK by A-769662 and erlotinib treatment showed a synergistic effect in cell growth reduction and apoptosis activation in H1299 cells compared to the single drugs. AMPK pathway analyses revealed an effective inhibition of mTOR signaling by drug combination. In H1299 xenografts, the tumor size was significantly decreased after combinatorial treatment. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that AMPK activation status affects response to erlotinib in distinct lung tumor models.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>86 (2), 151-157</Feld596><PubVol>86</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>151</StrtPage><EndPage>157</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Huelsmann HJ*" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Rolff J*" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bender C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Jarahian M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Korf U" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Herwig R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Froehlich H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Thomas M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Merk J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Fichtner I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Sueltmann H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Kuner R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="(*These authors contributed equally to this work)" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25240516</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.lungcan.2014.09.001</DOI><KST>B050</KST><KST>D015</KST><KST>B063</KST><KEYWORD>CARBOPLATIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>paclitaxel</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EGFR MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GEFITINIB</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHWAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH-FACTOR RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>adenocarcinoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>chemotherapy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LKB1/STK11</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52628</publishedID><Artikel>Interneuron control of hippocampal oscillations</Artikel><Journal>Current Opinion in Neurobiology</Journal><ABSTr>GABAergic interneurons in the hippocampus coordinate neuronal activity that gives rise to network oscillations.

Especially papillary sulfatides contribute to renal adaptation to chronic metabolic acidosis. Due to differences in their ceramide anchors, the structural diversity of renal sulfatides is large. However, the underling biological function of this complexity is not understood. As a compound's function and its tissue location are intimately connected, we analyzed individual renal sulfatide distributions of control and ceramide synthase 2-deficient mice by imaging mass spectrometry and by LC-MS2, (in controls for cortex, medulla, and papillae separately). To explain locally different structures, we compared our lipid data with regional mRNA levels of corresponding anabolic enzymes. The combination of IMS and in source decay-LC-MS2 analyses revealed exclusive expression of C20-sphingosine-containing sulfatides within renal papillae, whereas conventional C18-sphingosine-containing compounds were predominant in medulla, and sulfatides with a C18-phytosphingosine were restricted to special cortical structures. Ceramide synthase 2 deletion resulted in bulk loss of sulfatides with C23/C24-acyl chains, but did not lead to decreased urinary pH as previously observed in sulfatide-depleted kidneys. Reasons may be the almost unchanged C22-sulfatid levels and constant total renal sulfatide levels due to compensation with C16- to C20-acyl chain-containing compounds. Intriguingly, CerS2-deficient kidneys were completely depleted of phytosphingosine-containing cortical sulfatides without any compensation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>55 (11), 2354-2369</Feld596><PubVol>55</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>2354</StrtPage><EndPage>2369</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Marsching C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Rabionet M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Mathow D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Jennemann R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kremser C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Porubsky S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Bolenz C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Willecke K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Groene HJ" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Hopf C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Sandhoff R" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25267995</PMID><DOI>10.1194/jlr.M051839</DOI><KST>G130</KST><KST>G131</KST><KEYWORD>PERMEABILITY BARRIER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FATTY-ACIDS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BIOSYNTHESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MASS-SPECTROMETRY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>kidney</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SPHINGOLIPIDS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SERINE PALMITOYLTRANSFERASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ELECTROSPRAY-IONIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CERAMIDE SYNTHASE 2</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52655</publishedID><Artikel>The REQUITE Project: Validating Predictive Models and Biomarkers of Radiotherapy Toxicity to Reduce Side-effects and Improve Quality of Life in Cancer Survivors</Artikel><Journal>Clinical Oncology</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>26 (12), 739-742</Feld596><PubVol>26</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>739</StrtPage><EndPage>742</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="West C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Azria D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Chang-Claude J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Davidson S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Lambin P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Rosenstein B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="De Ruysscher D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Talbot C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Thierens H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Valdagni R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Vega A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Yuille M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25267305</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.clon.2014.09.008</DOI><KST>C020</KST></row><row><publishedID>52657</publishedID><Artikel>A breast cancer stem cell niche supported by juxtacrine signalling from monocytes and macrophages</Artikel><Journal>Nature Cell Biology</Journal><ABSTr>The cell-biological program termed the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) confers on cancer cells mesenchymal traits and an ability to enter the cancer stem cell (CSC) state. However, the interactions between CSCs and their surrounding microenvironment are poorly understood. Here we show that tumour-associated monocytes and macrophages (TAMs) create a CSC niche through juxtacrine signalling with CSCs. We performed quantitative proteomic profiling and found that the EMT program upregulates the expression of CD90, also known as Thy1, and EphA4, which mediate the physical interactions of CSCs with TAMs by directly binding with their respective counter-receptors on these cells. In response, the EphA4 receptor on the carcinoma cells activates Src and NF-kappaB. In turn, NF-kappaB in the CSCs induces the secretion of a variety of cytokines that serve to sustain the stem cell state. Indeed, admixed macrophages enhance the CSC activities of carcinoma cells.

In previous studies, the associations between increased intakes of carbohydrates, sugar, starch, and inflammatory bowel disease are inconsistent. However, few prospective studies have investigated the associations between these macronutrients and incident Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS:: A total of 401,326 men and women were recruited between 1991 and 1998. At recruitment, dietary intakes of carbohydrate, sugar, and starch were measured using validated food frequency questionnaires. The cohort was monitored identifying participants who developed incident CD or UC. Cases were matched with 4 controls, and odds ratios were calculated for quintiles of total carbohydrate, sugar, and starch intakes adjusted for total energy intake, body mass index, and smoking. RESULTS:: One hundred ten participants developed CD, and 244 participants developed UC during follow-up. The adjusted odds ratio for the highest versus the lowest quintiles of total carbohydrate intake for CD was 0.87, 95% CI = 0.24 to 3.12 and for UC 1.46, 95% CI = 0.62 to 3.46, with no significant trends across quintiles for either (CD, Ptrend = 0.70; UC, Ptrend = 0.41). Similarly, no associations were observed with intakes of total sugar (CD, Ptrend = 0.50; UC, Ptrend = 0.71) or starch (CD, Ptrend = 0.69; UC, Ptrend = 0.17). CONCLUSIONS:: The lack of associations with these nutrients is in agreement with many case-control studies that have not identified associations with CD or UC. As there is biological plausibility for how specific carbohydrates could have an etiological role in inflammatory bowel disease, future epidemiological work should assess individual carbohydrates, although there does not seem to be a macronutrient effect.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 3.0 License, where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

Aberrant activation of Shh signaling causes overproliferation of GCPs, leading to medulloblastoma. Although the Shh-binding protein Boc associates with the Shh receptor Ptch1 to mediate Shh signaling, whether Boc plays a role in medulloblastoma is unknown. Here, we show that BOC is upregulated in medulloblastomas and induces GCP proliferation. Conversely, Boc inactivation reduces proliferation and progression of early medulloblastomas to advanced tumors. Mechanistically, we find that Boc, through elevated Shh signaling, promotes high levels of DNA damage, an effect mediated by CyclinD1. High DNA damage in the presence of Boc increases the incidence of Ptch1 loss of heterozygosity, an important event in the progression from early to advanced medulloblastoma. Together, our results indicate that DNA damage promoted by Boc leads to the demise of its own coreceptor, Ptch1, and consequently medulloblastoma progression.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>31 (1), 34-47</Feld596><PubVol>31</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>34</StrtPage><EndPage>47</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Mille F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Tamayo-Orrego L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Levesque M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Remke M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Korshunov A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Cardin J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Bouchard N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Izzi L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Kool M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Northcott PA" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Taylor MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Pfister SM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Charron F" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25263791</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.devcel.2014.08.010</DOI><KST>G380</KST><KST>B062</KST><KEYWORD>N-MYC</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMORIGENESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEURONAL PRECURSORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHWAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>proliferation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SONIC HEDGEHOG</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATCHED HETEROZYGOUS MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CDO</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52665</publishedID><Artikel>Myeloid-derived suppressor cells in malignant melanoma</Artikel><Journal>Journal der Deutschen Dermatologischen Gesellschaft</Journal><ABSTr>Melanoma is known for its rapid progression, metastasis to distant organs and therapeutic resistance. Despite high melanoma immunogenicity, the results of immunotherapeutic clinical studies are mostly unsatisfactory. One explanation is the development of strong immunosuppression mediated by highly immunosuppressive regulatory leukocytes, in particular, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). These cells were found to be enriched and activated in the melanoma microenvironment, inducing a profound impairment of anti-tumor immune responses and leading to the tumor progression. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of MDSC generation, migration to the tumor site and activation as well as their targeting is important for the development of novel strategies for effective melanoma immunotherapy. We suggest that such therapeutic approaches should involve the inhibition of MDSC-mediated immunosuppressive melanoma microenvironment combined with other immunologic treatments.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>12 (11), 1021-1027</Feld596><PubVol>12</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>1021</StrtPage><EndPage>1027</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Umansky V" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Sevko A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Gebhardt C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Utikal J" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25263083</PMID><DOI>10.1111/ddg.12411</DOI><KST>G300</KST></row><row><publishedID>52666</publishedID><Artikel>Genome-wide association study identifies multiple susceptibility loci for diffuse large B cell lymphoma</Artikel><Journal>Nature Genetics</Journal><ABSTr>Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common lymphoma subtype and is clinically aggressive. To identify genetic susceptibility loci for DLBCL, we conducted a meta-analysis of 3 new genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and 1 previous scan, totaling 3,857 cases and 7,666 controls of European ancestry, with additional genotyping of 9 promising SNPs in 1,359 cases and 4,557 controls. In our multi-stage analysis, five independent SNPs in four loci achieved genome-wide significance marked by rs116446171 at 6p25.3 (EXOC2; P = 2.33 x 10-21), rs2523607 at 6p21.33 (HLA-B; P = 2.40 x 10-10), rs79480871 at 2p23.3 (NCOA1; P = 4.23 x 10-8) and two independent SNPs, rs13255292 and rs4733601, at 8q24.21 (PVT1; P = 9.98 x 10-13 and 3.63 x 10-11, respectively). These data provide substantial new evidence for genetic susceptibility to this B cell malignancy and point to pathways involved in immune recognition and immune function in the pathogenesis of

DNA methylation signature to predict disease-free survival in locally advanced rectal cancer</Artikel><Journal>Oncotarget</Journal><ABSTr>In locally advanced rectal cancer a preoperative predictive biomarker is necessary to adjust treatment specifically for those patients expected to suffer relapse. We applied whole genome methylation CpG island array analyses to an initial set of patients (n=11) to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that separate a good from a bad prognosis group. Using a quantitative high-resolution approach, candidate DMRs were first validated in a set of 61 patients (test set) and then confirmed DMRs were further validated in additional independent patient cohorts (n=71, n=42). We identified twenty highly discriminative DMRs and validated them in the test set using the MassARRAY technique. Ten DMRs could be confirmed which allowed separation into prognosis groups (p=0.0207, HR=4.09). The classifier was validated in two additional cohorts (n=71, p=0.0345, HR=3.57 and n=42, p=0.0113, HR=3.78). Interestingly, six of the ten DMRs represented regions close to the transcriptional start sites of genes which are also marked by the Polycomb Repressor Complex component EZH2. In conclusion we present a classifier comprising 10 DMRs which predicts patient prognosis with a high degree of accuracy. These data may now help to discriminate between patients that may respond better to standard treatments from those that may require alternative modalities.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>5 (18), 8123-8135</Feld596><PubVol>5</PubVol><PubIss>18</PubIss><StrtPage>8123</StrtPage><EndPage>8135</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Gaedcke J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Leha A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Claus R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Weichenhan D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Jung K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Kitz J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Grade M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Wolff HA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Jo P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Doyen J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Gerard JP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Johnsen SA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Plass C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Beissbarth T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Ghadimi M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25261372</PMID><KST>C010</KST><KEYWORD>PREOPERATIVE RADIOTHERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>total mesorectal excision</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR-REGRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POSTOPERATIVE CHEMORADIOTHERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHENOTYPE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGNOSTIC-SIGNIFICANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OXALIPLATIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>chemotherapy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRIAL</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52669</publishedID><Artikel>Data-derived modeling characterizes plasticity of MAPK signaling in melanoma</Artikel><Journal>PloS Computational Biology</Journal><ABSTr>The majority of melanomas have been shown to harbor somatic mutations in the RAS-RAF-MEK-MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways, which play a major role in regulation of proliferation and survival. The prevalence of these mutations makes these kinase signal transduction pathways an attractive target for cancer therapy. However, tumors have generally shown adaptive resistance to treatment. This adaptation is achieved in melanoma through its ability to undergo neovascularization, migration and rearrangement of signaling pathways. To understand the dynamic, nonlinear behavior of signaling pathways in cancer, several computational modeling approaches have been suggested. Most of those models require that the pathway topology remains constant over the entire observation period. However, changes in topology might underlie adaptive behavior to drug treatment. To study signaling rearrangements, here we present a new approach based on Fuzzy Logic (FL) that predicts changes in network architecture over time. This adaptive modeling approach was used to investigate pathway dynamics in a newly acquired experimental dataset describing total and phosphorylated protein signaling over four days in A375 melanoma cell line exposed to different kinase inhibitors. First, a generalized strategy was established to implement a parameter-reduced FL model encoding non-linear activity of a signaling network in response to perturbation. Next, a literature-based topology was generated and parameters of the FL model were derived from the full experimental dataset. Subsequently, the temporal evolution of model performance was evaluated by leaving time-defined data points out of training. Emerging discrepancies between model predictions and experimental data at specific time points allowed the characterization of potential network rearrangement. We demonstrate that this adaptive FL modeling approach helps to enhance our mechanistic understanding of the molecular plasticity of melanoma.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>10 (9), e1003795-</Feld596><PubVol>10</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>e1003795</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Bernardo-Faura M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Massen S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Falk CS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Brady NR" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Eils R" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25188314</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003795</DOI><KST>B080</KST><KST>B170</KST><KEYWORD>TUMOR PROGRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>APOPTOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INHIBITOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHWAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>KINASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NETWORKS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BRAF</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LOGIC-BASED MODELS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52671</publishedID><Artikel>Collection and Use of Family History in Oncology Clinics</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Clinical Oncology</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>32 (29), 3344-3345</Feld596><PubVol>32</PubVol><PubIss>29</PubIss><StrtPage>3344</StrtPage><EndPage>3345</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hemminki K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Fallah M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Hemminki A" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25185094</PMID><DOI>10.1200/JCO.2014.56.4336</DOI><KST>C050</KST><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MELANOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INDIVIDUALS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52675</publishedID><Artikel>NBN and XRCC3 genetic variants in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Epidemiology</Journal><ABSTr>Nibrin and DNA repair protein XRCC3 are involved in DNA double-strand break repair.

Therefore, reliable and safe methods for the generation of specific cell types must be established. Recently, different strategies have emerged to convert somatic cells into differentiated cells of interest. One of these strategies is cellular reprogramming, which converts somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). These iPSCs are embryonic stem cell-like cells with almost unlimited developmental potential and can be differentiated into specific lineages. Alternatively, the method of transdifferentiation can be used to directly convert one terminally differentiated cell into another cell type. Both of these methods have proven to have the potential to push the field of cell replacement therapy forward. In this context, the skin is of particular interest because it represents an ideal source of somatic cells for reprogramming to pluripotency as well as transdifferentiation. In this review, we briefly compare both above-mentioned strategies and summarize the latest advances in this highly dynamic field of research.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>12 (9), 789-793</Feld596><PubVol>12</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>789</StrtPage><EndPage>793</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Novak D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Weina K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Utikal J" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25176458</PMID><DOI>10.1111/ddg.12403_suppl</DOI><KST>G300</KST><KEYWORD>DIRECT CONVERSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEURONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN FIBROBLASTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PLURIPOTENT STEM-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IPS CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DEFINED FACTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>cardiomyocytes</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INDUCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENERATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52677</publishedID><Artikel>SUMOylation-Dependent LRH-1/PROX1 Interaction Promotes Atherosclerosis by Decreasing Hepatic Reverse Cholesterol Transport</Artikel><Journal>Cell Metabolism</Journal><ABSTr>Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) is an antiatherogenic process in which excessive cholesterol from peripheral tissues is transported to the liver and finally excreted from the body via the bile. The nuclear receptor liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1) drives expression of genes regulating RCT, and its activity can be modified by different posttranslational modifications. Here, we show that atherosclerosis-prone mice carrying a mutation that abolishes SUMOylation of LRH-1 on K289R develop less aortic plaques than control littermates when exposed to a high-cholesterol diet. The mechanism underlying this atheroprotection involves an increase in RCT and its associated hepatic genes and is secondary to a compromised interaction of LRH-1 K289R with the corepressor prospero homeobox protein 1 (PROX1). Our study reveals that the SUMOylation status of a single nuclear receptor lysine residue can impact the development of a complex metabolic disease such as atherosclerosis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>20 (4), 603-613</Feld596><PubVol>20</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>603</StrtPage><EndPage>613</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Stein S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Oosterveer MH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Mataki C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Xu P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Lemos V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Havinga R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Dittner C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Ryu D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Menzies KJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Wang X" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Perino A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Houten SM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Melchior F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Schoonjans K" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25176150</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.cmet.2014.07.023</DOI><KST>A170</KST><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>transcription</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METABOLISM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NUCLEAR RECEPTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIVER RECEPTOR HOMOLOG-1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LRH-1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIVER-RECEPTOR-HOMOLOG-1</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52680</publishedID><Artikel>AP4 is required for mitogen- and c-MYC-induced cell cycle progression</Artikel><Journal>Oncotarget</Journal><ABSTr>AP4 represents a c-MYC-inducible bHLH-LZ transcription factor, which displays elevated expression in many types of tumors. We found that serum-starved AP4-deficient mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were unable to resume proliferation and showed a delayed S-phase entry after restimulation. Furthermore, they accumulated as tetraploid cells due to a cytokinesis defect. In addition, AP4 was required for c-MYC-induced cell cycle re-entry. AP4-deficient MEFs displayed decreased expression of CDK2 (cyclin-dependent kinase 2), which we characterized as a conserved and direct AP4 target. Activation of an AP4 estrogen receptor fusion protein (AP4-ER) enhanced proliferation of human diploid fibroblasts in a CDK2-dependent manner. However, in contrast to c-MYC-ER, AP4-ER activation was not sufficient to induce cell cycle re-entry or apoptosis in serum-starved MEFs. AP4-deficiency was accompanied by increased spontaneous and c-MYC-induced DNA damage in MEFs. Furthermore, c-MYC-induced apoptosis was decreased in AP4-deficient MEFs, suggesting that induction of apoptosis by c-MYC is linked to its ability to activate AP4 and thereby cell cycle progression. Taken together, these results indicate that AP4 is a central mediator and coordinator of cell cycle progression in response to mitogenic signals and c-MYC activation. Therefore, inhibition of AP4 function may represent a therapeutic approach to block tumor cell proliferation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>5 (17), 7316-7327</Feld596><PubVol>5</PubVol><PubIss>17</PubIss><StrtPage>7316</StrtPage><EndPage>7327</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Jackstadt R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Hermeking H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25261373</PMID><KST>L701</KST><KEYWORD>cdk4</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CENTROSOME AMPLIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPITHELIAL-MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BINDING</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TARGET</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSFORMATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OVEREXPRESSION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52681</publishedID><Artikel>Long-term follow-up of cytogenetically normal CEBPA-mutated AML</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Hematology and Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>BackgroundThe aim of this study was to analyze the long-term survival of AML patients with CEBPA mutations.Patients and methodsWe investigated 88 AML patients with a median age of 61 years and (1) cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML), (2) monoallelic (moCEBPA) or biallelic (biCEBPA) CEBPA mutation, and (3) intensive induction treatment. 60/88 patients have been described previously with a shorter follow-up.ResultsMedian follow-up time was 9.8 years (95% CI: 9.4-10.1 years) compared to 3.2 and 5.2 years in our former analyses. Patients with biCEBPA survived significantly longer compared to those with moCEBPA (median overall survival (OS) 9.6 years vs. 1.7 years, p inverted question mark= inverted question mark0.008). Patients inverted question mark inverted question mark inverted question mark60 years and biCEBPA mutations showed a favorable prognosis with a 10-year OS rate of 81%.Both, bi- and moCEBPA-mutated groups had a low early death (d60) rate of 7% and 9%, respectively. Complete remission (CR) rates for biCEBPA- and moCEBPA-mutated patients were 82% vs. 70% (p inverted question mark= inverted question mark0.17). biCEBPA-mutated patients showed a longer relapse free survival (RFS) (median RFS 9.4 years vs. 1.5 years, p inverted question mark= inverted question mark0.021) and a lower cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) compared to moCEBPA-mutated patients. These differences in OS and RFS were confirmed after adjustment for known clinical and molecular prognostic factors.ConclusionsIn this long-term observation we confirmed the favorable prognostic outcome of patients with biCEBPA mutations compared to moCEBPA-mutated CN-AML. The high probability of OS (81%) in younger patients is helpful to guide intensity of postremission therapy.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>7 (1), 55-</Feld596><PubVol>7</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>55</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Pastore F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Kling D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Hoster E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Dufour A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Konstandin NP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Schneider S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Sauerland MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Berdel WE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Buechner T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Woermann B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Braess J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Hiddemann W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Spiekermann K" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25214041</PMID><DOI>10.1186/s13045-014-0055-7</DOI><KST>L701</KST><KEYWORD>STEM-CELL TRANSPLANTATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGNOSTIC RELEVANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>YOUNGER ADULTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMPETING RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>normal karyotype</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HIGH-DOSE CYTARABINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACUTE MYELOID-LEUKEMIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>C/EBP-ALPHA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACUTE MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52691</publishedID><Artikel>The genomic landscape of hepatoblastoma and their progenies with HCC-like features</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Hepatology</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the most common childhood liver cancer and occasionally presents with histological and clinical features reminiscent of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Identification of molecular mechanisms that drive the neoplastic continuation towards more aggressive HCC phenotypes may help to guide the new stage of targeted therapies. METHODS: We performed comprehensive studies on genetic and chromosomal alterations as well as candidate gene function and their clinical relevance. RESULTS: Whole-exome sequencing identified HB as the genetically most simple tumor ever described (2.9 mutations per tumor) with recurrent mutations in CTNNB1 (12/15 cases) and NFE2L2 (2/15 cases). Their HCC-like progenies share the common CTNNB1 mutation, but additionally exhibit a significantly increased mutation number and chromosomal instability due to deletions of the genome guardians RAD17 and TP53, accompanied by TERT promoter mutations. Targeted genotyping of 33 primary tumors and cell lines revealed CTNNB1, NFE2L2, and TERT mutations in 72.5%, 9.8%, and 5.9% of cases, respectively. All NFE2L2 mutations affected residues of the NFE2L2 protein that are recognized by the KEAP1/CUL3 complex for proteasomal degradation. Consequently, cells transfected with mutant NFE2L2 were insensitive to KEAP1-mediated downregulation of NFE2L2 signaling. Clinically, overexpression of the NFE2L2 target gene NQO1 in tumors was significantly associated with metastasis, vascular invasion, the adverse prognostic C2 gene signature, as well as poor outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the importance of CTNNB1 mutations and NFE2L2-KEAP1 pathway activation in HB development and defines loss of genomic stability and TERT promoter mutations as prominent characteristics of aggressive HB with HCC features.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>61 (6), 1312-1320</Feld596><PubVol>61</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>1312</StrtPage><EndPage>1320</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Eichenmuller M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Trippel F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kreuder M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Beck A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schwarzmayr T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Haberle B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Cairo S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Leuschner I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="von Schweinitz D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Strom TM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Kappler R" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25135868</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.jhep.2014.08.009</DOI><KST>L701</KST></row><row><publishedID>52692</publishedID><Artikel>Myc-induced SUMOylation is a therapeutic vulnerability for B-cell lymphoma</Artikel><Journal>Blood</Journal><ABSTr>Myc oncogenic transcription factors (c-Myc, N-Myc, and L-Myc) coordinate the control of cell growth, division, and metabolism. In cancer, Myc overexpression is often associated with aggressive disease, which is in part due to the destruction of select targets by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (eg, SCF(Skp2)-directed destruction of the Cdk inhibitor p27(Kip1)). We reasoned that Myc would also regulate SUMOylation, a related means of posttranslational modification of proteins, and that this circuit would play essential roles in Myc-dependent tumorigenesis. Here, we report marked increases in the expression of genes that encode regulators and components of the SUMOylation machinery in mouse and human Myc-driven lymphomas, resulting in hyper-SUMOylation in these tumors. Further, inhibition of SUMOylation by genetic means disables Myc-induced proliferation, triggering G2/M cell-cycle arrest, polyploidy, and apoptosis. Using genetically defined cell models and conditional expression systems, this response was shown to be Myc specific. Finally, in vivo loss-of-function and pharmacologic studies demonstrated that inhibition of SUMOylation provokes rapid regression of Myc-driven lymphoma. Thus, targeting SUMOylation represents an attractive therapeutic option for lymphomas with MYC involvement.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>124 (13), 2081-2090</Feld596><PubVol>124</PubVol><PubIss>13</PubIss><StrtPage>2081</StrtPage><EndPage>2090</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hoellein A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Fallahi M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Schoeffmann S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Steidle S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schaub FX" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Rudelius M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Laitinen I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Nilsson L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Goga A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Peschel C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Nilsson JA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Cleveland JL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Keller U" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25143484</PMID><DOI>10.1182/blood-2014-06-584524</DOI><KST>L701</KST><KEYWORD>PROTEIN-SYNTHESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR SUPPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SYNTHETIC LETHALITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DRIVEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>C-MYC</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INHIBITION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>KINASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHWAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52694</publishedID><Artikel>Phenotyping of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with advanced heavily pre-treated adenocarcinoma of the stomach and gastro-esophageal junction</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Immunology Immunotherapy</Journal><ABSTr>Immunotherapeutic approaches are emerging as promising new treatment options for patients with solid cancers. The host immune system in cancer patients is dysfunctional due to a number of reasons. The level of immunosuppression is variable at the time of diagnosis and depends on the particular cancer entity, stage, and prior anti-cancer therapies. For many cancer entities, the immune alterations of the respective patient population have not been further characterized even though a patient's immunophenotype may be prognostic for the course of the disease or predictive for clinical/biological response to immunotherapy. In this study, we used flow cytometry to determine the phenotype of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 30 patients with heavily pre-treated, advanced adenocarcinoma of the stomach and gastro-esophageal junction. The frequencies and activation status of relevant immune effector populations were determined in PBMCs and compared to those of healthy individuals.

Therefore, Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced MRI could potentially be used for in vivo verification of the delivered dose distribution. Achieving this would be highly desirable, especially for particle therapy, where the accuracy and precision of the spatial dose deposition is affected by uncertainties of the range of particles in patients. However, the empirically detected effect needs to be understood before it can be used as a surrogate imaging biomarker for in vivo treatment verification or even liver functionality. Here, we propose a model of the underlying molecular mechanism of this phenomenon and discuss its implications for radiation therapy. We model the multi-step process starting from the immediate response after liver irradiation to the delayed/subsequent signal decrease in Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced MRI. The model is based on both: (a) Evidence from different previously published reports and (b) a detailed evaluation of intra-hepatic signaling using a pathway analysis to identify potential pathways that are critical in this process. The proposed model provides mechanistic understanding of the reduced signal intensity in Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced MRI occurring in irradiated liver. We think that establishing this comprehensive model will be of great interest for the field of radiation oncology and can trigger further research. For example, measuring the expression of involved cytokines and specific transport proteins in blood samples and biopsy derived tissue samples and correlating the results with MRI imaging could give important information and may even explain inter-patient variations in MRI signal decrease.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>83 (4), 477-481</Feld596><PubVol>83</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>477</StrtPage><EndPage>481</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Richter C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Seco J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Hong TS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Duda DG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Bortfeld T" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25175713</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.mehy.2014.08.004</DOI><KST>L301</KST><KEYWORD>HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONTRAST AGENTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>organic anion transporters</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEPATIC-UPTAKE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NECROSIS-FACTOR-ALPHA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MESSENGER-RNA LEVELS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TNF-ALPHA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER-TREATMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NUCLEAR FACTOR-1-ALPHA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IRRADIATION LEADS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52700</publishedID><Artikel>Medical History, Lifestyle, Family History, and Occupational Risk Factors for Marginal Zone Lymphoma: The InterLymph Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Subtypes Project</Artikel><Journal>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), comprised of nodal, extranodal, and splenic subtypes, accounts for 5%-10% of non-Hodgkin lymphoma cases.

CONCLUSION: Our results provide new data suggesting etiologic heterogeneity across MZL subtypes although a common risk of MZL associated with B-cell activating autoimmune conditions was found.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>2014 (48), 52-65</Feld596><PubVol>2014</PubVol><PubIss>48</PubIss><StrtPage>52</StrtPage><EndPage>65</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Bracci PM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Benavente Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Turner JJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Paltiel O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Slager SL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Vajdic CM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Norman AD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Cerhan JR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Chiu BC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Becker N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Cocco P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Dogan A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Nieters A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Holly EA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Kane EV" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Smedby KE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Maynadie M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Spinelli JJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Roman E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Glimelius B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Wang SS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Sampson JN" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Morton LM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="de Sanjose S" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25174026</PMID><DOI>10.1093/jncimonographs/lgu011</DOI><KST>C020</KST></row><row><publishedID>52701</publishedID><Artikel>Novel replication-competent circular DNA molecules from healthy cattle serum and milk and multiple sclerosis-affected human brain tissue</Artikel><Journal>Genome Announcements</Journal><ABSTr>Epidemiological data point to the involvement of a cow milk factor in the etiology of multiple sclerosis (MS).

Here we show that BGLF4, the only protein kinase encoded by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), controls expression of late genes independent of its effect on viral DNA replication. Ectopic expression of BGLF4 in cells lacking the kinase gene stimulated the transcript levels of six late genes by 8- to 10-fold. Introduction of a BGLF4 mutant that eliminated its kinase activity did not stimulate late gene expression. In cells infected with wild-type EBV, siRNA to BGLF4 (siG4) markedly reduced late gene expression without compromising viral DNA replication. Synthesis of late products was restored upon expression of a form of BGLF4 resistant to the siRNA. Studying the EBV transcriptome using mRNA-seq during the late phase of the lytic cycle in the absence and presence of siG4 showed that BGLF4 controlled expression of 31 late genes. Analysis of the EBV transcriptome identified BGLF3 as a gene whose expression was reduced as a result of silencing BGLF4. Knockdown of BGLF3 markedly reduced late gene expression but had no effect on viral DNA replication or expression of BGLF4. Our findings reveal the presence of a late control locus encompassing BGLF3 and BGLF4 in the EBV genome, and provide evidence for the importance of both proteins in post-replication events that are necessary for expression of late genes.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>10 (8), e1004307-</Feld596><PubVol>10</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>e1004307</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="El-Guindy A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Lopez-Giraldez F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Delecluse HJ" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="McKenzie J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Miller G" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25166506</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.ppat.1004307</DOI><KST>F100</KST><KEYWORD>LYTIC DNA-REPLICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LATE PROMOTER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSACTIVATION ACTIVITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EA-D</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SARCOMA-ASSOCIATED HERPESVIRUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN CYTOMEGALOVIRUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RNA-SEQ</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IDENTIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHOSPHORYLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NF-KAPPA-B</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52709</publishedID><Artikel>Adoptive Transfer of EBV Specific CD8+ T Cell Clones Can Transiently Control EBV Infection in Humanized Mice</Artikel><Journal>PloS Pathogens</Journal><ABSTr>Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infection expands CD8+ T cells specific for lytic antigens to high frequencies during symptomatic primary infection, and maintains these at significant numbers during persistence. Despite this, the protective function of these lytic EBV antigen-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T cells remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that lytic EBV replication does not significantly contribute to virus-induced B cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo in a mouse model with reconstituted human immune system components (huNSG mice). However, we report a trend to reduction of EBV-induced lymphoproliferation outside of lymphoid organs upon diminished lytic replication. Moreover, we could demonstrate that CD8+ T cells against the lytic EBV antigen BMLF1 can eliminate lytically replicating EBV-transformed B cells from lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) and in vivo, thereby transiently controlling high viremia after adoptive transfer into EBV infected huNSG mice. These findings suggest a protective function for lytic EBV antigen-specific CD8+ T cells against EBV infection and against virus-associated tumors in extra-lymphoid organs. These specificities should be explored for EBV-specific vaccine development.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>10 (8), e1004333-</Feld596><PubVol>10</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>e1004333</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Antsiferova O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Muller A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Ramer PC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Chijioke O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Chatterjee B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Raykova A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Planas R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Sospedra M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Shumilov A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Tsai MH" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Delecluse HJ" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Munz C" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25165855</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.ppat.1004333</DOI><KST>F100</KST><KEYWORD>RESPONSES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DENDRITIC CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VACCINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPSTEIN-BARR-VIRUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DEC-205</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MONONUCLEOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VIRAL-INFECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NASOPHARYNGEAL CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POSTTRANSPLANTATION LYMPHOPROLIFERATIVE DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LYTIC CYCLE ANTIGENS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52710</publishedID><Artikel>Advances in treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia</Artikel><Journal>F1000prime Reports</Journal><ABSTr>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most prevalent type of leukemia, affects mostly elderly CLL patients, and is incurable without allogeneic transplantation.

The DAergic and cholinergic system dynamically interact to gate and potentiate sensory inputs to striatum. Striatal cholinergic interneurons (CINs) respond to relevant sensory stimuli with an initial burst, a firing pause, or a late burst, or a combination of these three components. CIN responses coincide with phasic firing of DAergic neurons in vivo. In particular, the late burst of CINs codes for the anticipated reward. To examine whether DAergic midbrain afferents can evoke the different CIN responses, we recorded from adult olfactory tubercle slices in the mouse ventral striatum. Olfactory inputs to striatal projection neurons were gated by the cholinergic tone. Phasic optogenetic activation of DAergic terminals evoked combinations of initial bursts, pauses, and late bursts in subsets of CINs by distinct receptor pathways. Glutamate release from midbrain afferents evoked an NMDAR-dependent initial burst followed by an afterhyperpolarization-induced pause. Phasic release of DA itself evoked acute changes in CIN firing. In particular, in CINs without an initial burst, phasic DA release evoked a pause through D2-type DA receptor activation. Independently, phasic DA activated a slow depolarizing conductance and the late burst through a D1-type DA receptor pathway. In summary, DAergic neurons elicit transient subsecond firing responses in CINs by sequential activation of NMDA, D2-type, and D1-type receptors. This fast control of striatal cholinergic tone by phasic DA provides a novel dynamic link of two transmitter systems central to the detection and selection of relevant stimuli.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>34 (35), 11549-11559</Feld596><PubVol>34</PubVol><PubIss>35</PubIss><StrtPage>11549</StrtPage><EndPage>11559</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Wieland S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Du D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Oswald MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Parlato R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kohr G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Kelsch W" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25164653</PMID><DOI>10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1175-14.2014</DOI><KST>A992</KST><KEYWORD>OLFACTORY TUBERCLE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MIDBRAIN DOPAMINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLUTAMATE NEURONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AFFERENT-FIBERS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DORSAL STRIATUM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RAT STRIATUM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RESPONSES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52713</publishedID><Artikel>Cilengitide combined with standard treatment for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma with methylated MGMT promoter (CENTRIC EORTC 26071-22072 study): a multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial</Artikel><Journal>Lancet Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Cilengitide is a selective alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrin inhibitor. Data from phase 2 trials suggest that it has antitumour activity as a single agent in recurrent glioblastoma and in combination with standard temozolomide chemoradiotherapy in newly diagnosed glioblastoma (particularly in tumours with methylated MGMT promoter). We aimed to assess cilengitide combined with temozolomide chemoradiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma with methylated MGMT promoter. METHODS: In this multicentre, open-label, phase 3 study, we investigated the efficacy of cilengitide in patients from 146 study sites in 25 countries. Eligible patients (newly diagnosed, histologically proven supratentorial glioblastoma, methylated MGMT promoter, and age &gt;/=18 years) were stratified for prognostic Radiation Therapy Oncology Group recursive partitioning analysis class and geographic region and centrally randomised in a 1:1 ratio with interactive voice response system to receive temozolomide chemoradiotherapy with cilengitide 2000 mg intravenously twice weekly (cilengitide group) or temozolomide chemoradiotherapy alone (control group). Patients and investigators were unmasked to treatment allocation. Maintenance temozolomide was given for up to six cycles, and cilengitide was given for up to 18 months or until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. The primary endpoint was overall survival. We analysed survival outcomes by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00689221. FINDINGS: Overall, 3471 patients were screened. Of these patients, 3060 had tumour MGMT status tested; 926 patients had a methylated MGMT promoter, and 545 were randomly assigned to the cilengitide (n=272) or control groups (n=273) between Oct 31, 2008, and May 12, 2011. Median overall survival was 26.3 months (95% CI 23.8-28.8) in the cilengitide group and 26.3 months (23.9-34.7) in the control group (hazard ratio 1.02, 95% CI 0.81-1.29, p=0.86). None of the predefined clinical subgroups showed a benefit from cilengitide. We noted no overall additional toxic effects with cilengitide treatment. The most commonly reported adverse events of grade 3 or worse in the safety population were lymphopenia (31 [12%] in the cilengitide group vs 26 [10%] in the control group), thrombocytopenia (28 [11%] vs 46 [18%]), neutropenia (19 [7%] vs 24 [9%]), leucopenia (18 [7%] vs 20 [8%]), and convulsion (14 [5%] vs 15 [6%]). INTERPRETATION: The addition of cilengitide to temozolomide chemoradiotherapy did not improve outcomes; cilengitide will not be further developed as an anticancer drug. Nevertheless, integrins remain a potential treatment target for glioblastoma.

Several statistical and mechanistic models have come up the last couple of years explaining gene transcription levels using information of potential transcriptional regulators as transcription factors (TFs) and information from epigenetic modifications. The activity of TFs is often inferred by their transcription levels, promoter binding and epigenetic effects. However, in principle, these methods do not take hard-to-measure influences such as post-transcriptional modifications into account. RESULTS: For TFs, we present a novel concept circumventing this problem. We estimate the regulatory activity of TFs using their cumulative effects on their target genes. We established our model using expression data of 59 cell lines from the National Cancer Institute. The trained model was applied to an independent expression dataset of melanoma cells yielding excellent expression predictions and elucidated regulation of melanogenesis. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Using mixed-integer linear programming, we implemented a switch-like optimization enabling a constrained but optimal selection of TFs and optimal model selection estimating their effects. The method is generic and can also be applied to further regulators of transcription.

From the characterization of more than 6,000 proteins, 27,000 transcripts, and 15,000 differentially methylated regions (DMRs), we identified coordinated changes associated with early differentiation steps. DMRs show continuous gain or loss of methylation during differentiation, and the overall change in DNA methylation correlates inversely with gene expression at key loci. Our data reveal the differential expression landscape of 493 transcription factors and 682 lncRNAs and highlight specific expression clusters operating in HSCs. We also found an unexpectedly dynamic pattern of transcript isoform regulation, suggesting a critical regulatory role during HSC differentiation, and a cell cycle/DNA repair signature associated with multipotency in MPP2 cells. This study provides a comprehensive genome-wide resource for the functional exploration of molecular, cellular, and epigenetic regulation at the top of the hematopoietic hierarchy.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>15 (4), 507-522</Feld596><PubVol>15</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>507</StrtPage><EndPage>522</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Cabezas-Wallscheid N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Klimmeck D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Hansson J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Lipka DB" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Reyes A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Wang Q" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Weichenhan D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Lier A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="von Paleske L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Renders S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Wuensche P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Zeisberger P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Brocks D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Gu L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="14" name="Herrmann C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Haas S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="16" name="Essers MA" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="17" name="Brors B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="18" name="Eils R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="19" name="Huber W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Milsom MD" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="21" name="Plass C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="22" name="Krijgsveld J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Trumpp A" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25158935</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.stem.2014.07.005</DOI><KST>A010</KST><KST>B080</KST><KST>C010</KST><KST>G100</KST><KST>V960</KST><KST>L101</KST><KST>G200</KST><KST>A011</KST><KST>A012</KST><KEYWORD>GENOME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIFFERENTIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEMATOPOIETIC STEM-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LINEAGE COMMITMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>QUIESCENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LONG NONCODING RNAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SELF-RENEWAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Hox genes</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACUTE MYELOID-LEUKEMIA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52720</publishedID><Artikel>CTLA-4 and PD-L1 Checkpoint Blockade Enhances Oncolytic Measles Virus Therapy</Artikel><Journal>Molecular Therapy</Journal><ABSTr>We hypothesized that the combination of oncolytic virotherapy with immune checkpoint modulators would reduce tumor burden by direct cell lysis and stimulate antitumor immunity. In this study, we have generated attenuated Measles virus (MV) vectors encoding antibodies against CTLA-4 and PD-L1 (MV-aCTLA-4 and MV-aPD-L1). We characterized the vectors in terms of growth kinetics, antibody expression, and cytotoxicity in vitro. Immunotherapeutic effects were assessed in a newly established, fully immunocompetent murine model of malignant melanoma, B16-CD20. Analyses of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and restimulation experiments indicated a favorable immune profile after MV-mediated checkpoint modulation. Therapeutic benefits in terms of delayed tumor progression and prolonged median overall survival were observed for animals treated with vectors encoding anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-L1, respectively. Combining systemic administration of antibodies with MV treatment also improved therapeutic outcome. In vivo oncolytic efficacy against human tumors was studied in melanoma xenografts. MV-aCTLA-4 and MV-aPD-L1 were equally efficient as parental MV in this model, with high rates of complete tumor remission (&gt; 80%). Furthermore, we could demonstrate lysis of tumor cells and transgene expression in primary tissue from melanoma patients. The current results suggest rapid translation of combining immune checkpoint modulation with oncolytic viruses into clinical application.Molecular Therapy (2014); doi:10.1038/mt.2014.160.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>22 (11), 1949-1959</Feld596><PubVol>22</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>1949</StrtPage><EndPage>1959</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Engeland CE" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Grossardt C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Veinalde R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Bossow S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Lutz D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Kaufmann JK" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Shevchenko I" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Umansky V" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Nettelbeck DM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Weichert W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Jaeger D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="von Kalle C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Ungerechts G" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25156126</PMID><DOI>10.1038/mt.2014.160</DOI><KST>G300</KST><KST>G100</KST><KST>G120</KST><KEYWORD>RESCUE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IPILIMUMAB</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER-IMMUNOTHERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SAFETY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>antibody</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MELANOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMBINATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHEMOVIROTHERAPY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52723</publishedID><Artikel>Large contribution of human papillomavirus in vaginal neoplastic lesions: A worldwide study in 597 samples</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>AIM: This work describes the human papillomavirus (HPV) prevalence and the HPV type distribution in a large series of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) grades 2/3 and vaginal cancer worldwide. METHODS: We analysed 189 VAIN 2/3 and 408 invasive vaginal cancer cases collected from 31 countries from 1986 to 2011. After histopathological evaluation of sectioned formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, HPV DNA detection and typing was performed using the SPF-10/DNA enzyme immunoassay (DEIA)/LiPA25 system (version 1). A subset of 146 vaginal cancers was tested for p16INK4a expression, a cellular surrogate marker for HPV transformation. Prevalence ratios were estimated using multivariate Poisson regression with robust variance. RESULTS: HPV DNA was detected in 74% (95% confidence interval (CI): 70-78%) of invasive cancers and in 96% (95% CI: 92-98%) of VAIN 2/3. Among cancers, the highest detection rates were observed in warty-basaloid subtype of squamous cell carcinomas, and in younger ages. Concerning the type-specific distribution, HPV16 was the most frequently type detected in both precancerous and cancerous lesions (59%). p16INK4a overexpression was found in 87% of HPV DNA positive vaginal cancer cases. CONCLUSIONS: HPV was identified in a large proportion of invasive vaginal cancers and in almost all VAIN 2/3. HPV16 was the most common type detected. A large impact in the reduction of the burden of vaginal neoplastic lesions is expected among vaccinated cohorts.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>50 (16), 2846-2854</Feld596><PubVol>50</PubVol><PubIss>16</PubIss><StrtPage>2846</StrtPage><EndPage>2854</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Alemany L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Saunier M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Tinoco L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Quiros B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Alvarado-Cabrero I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Alejo M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Joura EA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Maldonado P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Klaustermeier J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Salmeron J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Bergeron C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Petry KU" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Guimera N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Clavero O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Murillo R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Clavel C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Wain V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Geraets DT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Jach R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Cross P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Carrilho C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Molina C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Shin HR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Mandys V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Nowakowski AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Vidal A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Lombardi L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Kitchener H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Sica AR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Magana-Leon C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Pawlita M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="31" name="Quint W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Bravo IG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Munoz N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="de Sanjose S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Bosch FX" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25155250</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.ejca.2014.07.018</DOI><KST>F020</KST><KEYWORD>GENOTYPE ATTRIBUTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIETHYLSTILBESTROL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPOSURE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POPULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>adenocarcinoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SQUAMOUS-CELL CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PREVALENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VULVA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METAANALYSIS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52724</publishedID><Artikel>Dietary fat intake and risk of epithelial ovarian cancer in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Epidemiology</Journal><ABSTr>There are inconsistent and limited data available to assess the relationship between fat intake and risk of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). We examined the consumption of total fat, fat sources and fat subtypes in relation to risk of EOC and its major histologic subtypes in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition which includes incident invasive (n=1095) and borderline (n=96) EOC. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In multivariate models, we observed no association with consumption of total fat, animal or plant fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, monounsaturated fat, or fatty fish and risk of invasive EOC. There was, however, an increased risk of invasive EOC in the highest category of intake (Quartile 4 vs. Quartile 1) of polyunsaturated fat (HR=1.22, 95% CI=1.02-1.48, Ptrend=0.02). We did not observe heterogeneity in the risk associations in comparisons of serous and endometrioid histologic subtypes. This study does not support an etiological role for total fat intake in relation to EOC risk; however, based on observations of a positive association between intake of polyunsaturated fat and invasive EOC risk in the current and previous studies, this fat subtype warrants further investigation to determine its potential role in EOC development.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>38 (5), 528-537</Feld596><PubVol>38</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>528</StrtPage><EndPage>537</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Merritt MA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Tsilidis KK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Hansen L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Dossus L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Fagherazzi G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Baglietto L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Fortner RT" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Ose J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Steffen A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Trichopoulos D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Lagiou P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Masala G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Sieri S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Mattiello A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Sacerdote C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Onland-Moret NC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Peeters PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Hjartaker A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Gram IT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Quiros JR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Obon-Santacana M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Molina-Montes E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Huerta Castano JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Ardanaz E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Chamosa S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Sonestedt E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Idahl A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Lundin E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Wareham N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Travis RC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Rinaldi S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Romieu I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Chajes V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Gunter MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25155210</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.canep.2014.07.011</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>METAANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RELATIVE VALIDITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>nutrient intake</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FOOD-FREQUENCY QUESTIONNAIRE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REPRODUCIBILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BREAST-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEALTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WOMEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COHORT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISEASE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52836</publishedID><Artikel>Genome-wide associations study and mouse expression data identify a highly conserved 32kb intergenic region between WNT3 and WNT9b as possible susceptibility locus for isolated classic exstrophy of bladder</Artikel><Journal>Human Molecular Genetics</Journal><ABSTr>Bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex (BEEC), the severe end of the urorectal malformation spectrum, has a profound impact on continence as well as sexual and renal functions. It is widely accepted that for the majority of cases the genetic basis appears to be multifactorial. Here, we report the first study which utilizes genome-wide association methods to analyze a cohort comprising patients presenting the most common BEEC form, classic bladder exstrophy (CBE), to identify common variation associated with risk for isolated CBE. We employed discovery and follow-up samples comprising 218 cases/865 controls and 78 trios in total, all of European descent. Our discovery sample identified a marker near SALL1, showing genome-wide significant association with CBE. However, analyses performed on follow-up samples did not add further support to these findings. We were also able to identify an association with CBE across our study samples (discovery: P = 8.88 x 10(-5); follow-up: P = 0.0025; combined: 1.09 x 10(-6)) in a highly conserved 32 kb intergenic region containing regulatory elements between WNT3 and WNT9B. Subsequent analyses in mice revealed expression for both genes in the genital region during stages relevant to the development of CBE in humans. Unfortunately, we were not able to replicate the suggestive signal for WNT3 and WNT9B in a sample that was enriched for non-CBE BEEC cases (P = 0.51). Our suggestive findings support the hypothesis that larger samples are warranted to identify association of common variation with CBE.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (20), 5536-5544</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>20</PubIss><StrtPage>5536</StrtPage><EndPage>5544</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Reutter H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Draaken M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Pennimpede T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Wittler L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Brockschmidt FF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Ebert AK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Bartels E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Roesch W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Boemers TM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Hirsch K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Schmiedeke E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Meesters C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Becker T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Stein R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Utsch B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Mangold E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Nordenskjöld A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Barker G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Kockum CC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Zwink N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="20" name="Holmdahl G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Läckgren G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Jenetzky E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="23" name="Feitz WF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Marcelis C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Wijers CH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="van Rooij IA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Gearhart JP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Herrmann BG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Ludwig M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Boyadjiev SA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Nöthen MM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Mattheisen M" IsDKFZ="0"/><DOI>10.1093/hmg/ddu259</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>GENES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROJECT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FAMILIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OF-THE-LITERATURE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPISPADIAS COMPLEX BEEC</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>imputation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GUDMAP</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SALL1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PLAYS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DYSREGULATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52841</publishedID><Artikel>Insulin-like Growth Factor Pathway Genetic Polymorphisms, Circulating IGF1 and IGFBP3, and Prostate Cancer Survival</Artikel><Journal>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</Journal><ABSTr>Background The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway has been implicated in prostate cancer (PCa) initiation, but its role in progression remains unknown.

Methods Among 5887 PCa patients (704 PCa deaths) of European ancestry from seven cohorts in the National Cancer Institute Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium, we conducted Cox kernel machine pathway analysis to evaluate whether 530 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 26 IGF pathway-related genes were collectively associated with PCa mortality. We also conducted SNP-specific analysis using stratified Cox models adjusting for multiple testing. In 2424 patients (313 PCa deaths), we evaluated the association of prediagnostic circulating IGF1 and IGFBP3 levels and PCa mortality. All statistical tests were two-sided.

Results The IGF signaling pathway was associated with PCa mortality (P = .03), and IGF2-AS and SSTR2 were the main contributors (both P = .04). In SNP-specific analysis, 36 SNPs were associated with PCa mortality with P-trend less than .05, but only three SNPs in the IGF2-AS remained statistically significant after gene-based corrections. Two were in linkage disequilibrium (r(2) = 1 for rs1004446 and rs3741211), whereas the third, rs4366464, was independent (r(2) = 0.03). The hazard ratios (HRs) per each additional risk allele were 1.19 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06 to 1.34; P-trend = .003) for rs3741211 and 1.44 (95% CI = 1.20 to 1.73; P-trend &lt; .001) for rs4366464. rs4366464 remained statistically significant after correction for all SNPs (P-trend.corr =.04). Prediagnostic IGF1 (HRhighest vs lowest quartile = 0.71; 95% CI = 0.48 to 1.04) and IGFBP3 (HR = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.65 to 1.34) levels were not associated with PCa mortality.

Conclusions The IGF signaling pathway, primarily IGF2-AS and SSTR2 genes, may be important in PCa survival.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>106 (5), Art.

One essential diagnostic criterion favouring thymoma is the demonstration of increased numbers of keratin-positive epithelial cells by immunohistochemistry. Loss of keratin expression in neoplastic epithelial cells could lead to detrimental misdiagnoses. We here describe a series of 14 thymic epithelial tumours (11 type B2 and B3 thymomas, 3 thymic carcinomas) with loss of expression of one or more keratins. Cases were analysed for expression of various keratins and desmosomal proteins by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence and compared with 45 unselected type B thymomas and 24 thymic carcinomas arranged in a multitissue histological array. All 14 cases showed highly reduced expression of at least one keratin, three cases were completely negative for all keratins studied. Of the 14 cases, 13 showed strong nuclear expression of p63. Expression of desmosomal proteins was preserved, suggesting intact cell contact structures. Loss of expression of broad-spectrum-keratins and K19 was observed in 3 and 5 % of unselected thymomas and in 30 and 60 % of thymic carcinomas. A proportion of keratin-depleted thymomas contained giant cells, reminiscent of thymic nurse cells. Loss of keratin expression in type B2 and B3 thymomas is an important diagnostic pitfall in the differential diagnosis with T-lymphoblastic lymphoma and can be expected in 5 % of cases. A panel of epithelial markers including p63 is warranted to ensure correct diagnosis of keratin-negative mediastinal tumours.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>465 (3), 313-320</Feld596><PubVol>465</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>313</StrtPage><EndPage>320</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Adam P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Hakroush S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Hofmann I" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Reidenbach S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Marx A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Strobel P" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24923897</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00428-014-1606-6</DOI><KST>A190</KST><KEYWORD>LYMPHOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>thymus</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52844</publishedID><Artikel>Inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers and risk of liver and biliary tract cancer</Artikel><Journal>Hepatology</Journal><ABSTr>Obesity and associated metabolic disorders have been implicated in liver carcinogenesis; however, there are little data on the role of obesity-related biomarkers on liver cancer risk. We studied prospectively the association of inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers with risks of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), intrahepatic bile duct (IBD), and gallbladder and biliary tract cancers outside of the liver (GBTC) in a nested case-control study within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition. Over an average of 7.7 years, 296 participants developed HCC (n=125), GBTC (n=137), or IBD (n=34). Using risk-set sampling, controls were selected in a 2:1 ratio and matched for recruitment center, age, sex, fasting status, and time of blood collection. Baseline serum concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-peptide, total high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin, leptin, fetuin-a, and glutamatdehydrogenase (GLDH) were measured, and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using conditional logistic regression. After adjustment for lifestyle factors, diabetes, hepatitis infection, and adiposity measures, higher concentrations of CRP, IL-6, C-peptide, and non-HMW adiponectin were associated with higher risk of HCC (IRR per doubling of concentrations=1.22; 95% CI=1.02-1.46; P=0.03; 1.90; 95% CI=1.30-2.77; P=0.001; 2.25; 95% CI=1.43-3.54; P=0.0005; and 2.09; 95% CI=1.19-3.67; P=0.01, respectively). CRP was associated also with risk of GBTC (IRR=1.22; 95% CI=1.05-1.42; P=0.01). GLDH was associated with risks of HCC (IRR=1.62; 95% CI=1.25-2.11; P=0.0003) and IBD (IRR=10.5; 95% CI=2.20-50.90; P=0.003). The continuous net reclassification index was 0.63 for CRP, IL-6, C-peptide, and non-HMW adiponectin and 0.46 for GLDH, indicating good predictive ability of these biomarkers. CONCLUSION: Elevated levels of biomarkers of inflammation and hyperinsulinemia are associated with a higher risk of HCC, independent of obesity and established liver cancer risk factors.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>60 (3), 858-871</Feld596><PubVol>60</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>858</StrtPage><EndPage>871</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Aleksandrova K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Nothlings U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Jenab M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Fedirko V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Kaaks R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Lukanova A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Trichopoulos D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Boffetta P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Trepo E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Westhpal S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Duarte-Salles T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Stepien M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Halkjaer J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Boutron-Ruault MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Dossus L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Racine A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Lagiou P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Bamia C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Benetou V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Agnoli C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Palli D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Panico S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Vineis P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Peeters PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Gram IT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Lund E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Quiros JR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Agudo A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Sanchez MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Gavrila D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Barricarte A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Dorronsoro M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Ohlsson B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Lindkvist B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Johansson A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Sund M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="44" name="Wareham N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="45" name="Travis RC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="46" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="47" name="Pischon T" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24443059</PMID><DOI>10.1002/hep.27016</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>leptin</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTERLEUKIN-6</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INSULIN-RESISTANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Adiponectin</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHRONIC HEPATITIS-C</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OBESITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MODELS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA RISK</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52845</publishedID><Artikel>Intratumor DNA methylation heterogeneity reflects clonal evolution in aggressive prostate cancer</Artikel><Journal>Cell Reports</Journal><ABSTr>Despite much evidence on epigenetic abnormalities in cancer, it is currently unclear to what extent epigenetic alterations can be associated with tumors' clonal genetic origins. Here, we show that the prostate intratumor heterogeneity in DNA methylation and copy-number patterns can be explained by a unified evolutionary process. By assaying multiple topographically distinct tumor sites, premalignant lesions, and lymph node metastases within five cases of prostate cancer, we demonstrate that both DNA methylation and copy-number heterogeneity consistently reflect the life history of the tumors. Furthermore, we show cases of genetic or epigenetic convergent evolution and highlight the diversity in the evolutionary origins and aberration spectrum between tumor and metastatic subclones. Importantly, DNA methylation can complement genetic data by serving as a proxy for activity at regulatory domains, as we show through identification of high epigenetic heterogeneity at androgen-receptor-bound enhancers. Epigenome variation thereby expands on the current genome-centric view on tumor heterogeneity.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>8 (3), 798-806</Feld596><PubVol>8</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>798</StrtPage><EndPage>806</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Brocks D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Assenov Y" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Minner S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Bogatyrova O" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Simon R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Koop C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Oakes C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Zucknick M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Lipka DB" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Weischenfeldt J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Feuerbach L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Cowper-Sal Lari R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Lupien M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Brors B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="14" name="Korbel J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Schlomm T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Tanay A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Sauter G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Gerhaeuser C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="19" name="Plass C" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25066126</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.celrep.2014.06.053</DOI><KST>B080</KST><KST>C010</KST><KST>C060</KST><KST>L101</KST><KST>G200</KST><KEYWORD>TUMOR EVOLUTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DENSITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>chemotherapy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC-LEUKEMIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REVEALS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANDROGEN RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLIOBLASTOMA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52850</publishedID><Artikel>[Radionuclide therapy of endocrine-related cancer]</Artikel><Journal>Radiologe</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>54 (10), 1007-1015</Feld596><PubVol>54</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>1007</StrtPage><EndPage>1015</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kratochwil,C."

The adhering junctions of the seminiferous epithelium represent special differentiation structures</Artikel><Journal>Cell and Tissue Research</Journal><ABSTr>The seminiferous tubules and the excurrent ducts of the mammalian testis are physiologically separated from the mesenchymal tissues and the blood and lymph system by a special structural barrier to paracellular translocations of molecules and particles: the "blood-testis barrier", formed by junctions connecting Sertoli cells with each other and with spermatogonial cells. In combined biochemical as well as light and electron microscopical studies we systematically determine the molecules located in the adhering junctions of adult mammalian (human, bovine, porcine, murine, i.e., rat and mouse) testis. We show that the seminiferous epithelium does not contain desmosomes, or "desmosome-like" junctions, nor any of the desmosome-specific marker molecules and that the adhering junctions of tubules and ductules are fundamentally different. While the ductules contain classical epithelial cell layers with E-cadherin-based adherens junctions (AJs) and typical desmosomes, the Sertoli cells of the tubules lack desmosomes and "desmosome-like" junctions but are connected by morphologically different forms of AJs. These junctions are based on N-cadherin anchored in cytoplasmic plaques, which in some subforms appear thick and dense but in other subforms contain only scarce and loosely arranged plaque structures formed by alpha- and beta-catenin, proteins p120, p0071 and plakoglobin, together with a member of the striatin family and also, in rodents, the proteins ZO-1 and myozap. These N-cadherin-based AJs also include two novel types of junctions: the "areae adhaerentes", i.e., variously-sized, often very large cell-cell contacts and small sieve-plate-like AJs perforated by cytoplasm-to-cytoplasm channels of 5-7 nm internal diameter ("cribelliform junctions"). We emphasize the unique character of this epithelium that totally lacks major epithelial marker molecules and structures such as keratin filaments and desmosomal elements as well as EpCAM- and PERP-containing junctions. We also discuss the nature, development and possible functions of these junctions.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>357 (3), 645-665</Feld596><PubVol>357</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>645</StrtPage><EndPage>665</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Domke LM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Rickelt S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Doerflinger Y" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kuhn C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Winter-Simanowski S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Zimbelmann R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Rosin-Arbesfeld R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Heid H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Franke WW" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24907851</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00441-014-1906-9</DOI><KST>A991</KST><KEYWORD>N-CADHERIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADHERENS JUNCTIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DESMOSOMAL PLAQUE PROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SERTOLI-CELL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MALE CONTRACEPTIVE DEVELOPMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RAT TESTIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ECTOPLASMIC SPECIALIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BARRIER DYNAMICS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CYTOSKELETAL PROTEINS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52853</publishedID><Artikel>Serial transfer of single-cell-derived immunocompetence reveals stemness of CD8(+) central memory T cells</Artikel><Journal>Immunity</Journal><ABSTr>Maintenance of immunological memory has been proposed to rely on stem-cell-like lymphocytes. However, data supporting this hypothesis are focused on the developmental potential of lymphocyte populations and are thus insufficient to establish the functional hallmarks of stemness. Here, we investigated self-renewal capacity and multipotency of individual memory lymphocytes by in vivo fate mapping of CD8(+) T cells and their descendants across three generations of serial single-cell adoptive transfer and infection-driven re-expansion. We found that immune responses derived from single naive T (Tn) cells, single primary, and single secondary central memory T (Tcm) cells reached similar size and phenotypic diversity, were subjected to comparable stochastic variation, and could ultimately reconstitute immunocompetence against an otherwise lethal infection with the bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. These observations establish that adult tissue stem cells reside within the CD62L(+) Tcm cell compartment and highlight the promising therapeutic potential of this immune cell subset.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>41 (1), 116-126</Feld596><PubVol>41</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>116</StrtPage><EndPage>126</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Graef P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Buchholz VR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Stemberger C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Flossdorf M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Henkel L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Schiemann M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Drexler I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Hoefer T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Riddell SR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Busch DH" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25035956</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.immuni.2014.05.018</DOI><KST>B086</KST><KEYWORD>COLONY-FORMING CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CD8-ALPHA(+) DENDRITIC CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SPLEEN COLONIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LISTERIA-MONOCYTOGENES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADOPTIVE TRANSFER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SELF-RENEWAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EFFECTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BONE-MARROW</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIFFERENTIATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52854</publishedID><Artikel>The G protein alpha subunit Galphas is a tumor suppressor in Sonic hedgehog-driven medulloblastoma</Artikel><Journal>Nature Medicine</Journal><ABSTr>Medulloblastoma, the most common malignant childhood brain tumor, exhibits distinct molecular subtypes and cellular origins. Genetic alterations driving medulloblastoma initiation and progression remain poorly understood. Herein, we identify GNAS, encoding the G protein Galphas, as a potent tumor suppressor gene that, when expressed at low levels, defines a subset of aggressive Sonic hedgehog (SHH)-driven human medulloblastomas. Ablation of the single Gnas gene in anatomically distinct progenitors in mice is sufficient to induce Shh-associated medulloblastomas, which recapitulate their human counterparts. Galphas is highly enriched at the primary cilium of granule neuron precursors and suppresses Shh signaling by regulating both the cAMP-dependent pathway and ciliary trafficking of Hedgehog pathway components. Elevation in levels of a Galphas effector, cAMP, effectively inhibits tumor cell proliferation and progression in Gnas-ablated mice. Thus, our gain- and loss-of-function studies identify a previously unrecognized tumor suppressor function for Galphas that can be found consistently across Shh-group medulloblastomas of disparate cellular and anatomical origins, highlighting G protein modulation as a potential therapeutic avenue.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>20 (9), 1035-1042</Feld596><PubVol>20</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>1035</StrtPage><EndPage>1042</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="He X" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Zhang L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Chen Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Remke M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Shih D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Lu F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Wang H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Deng Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Yu Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Xia Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Wu X" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Ramaswamy V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Hu T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Wang F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Zhou W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Burns DK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Kim SH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Kool M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="18" name="Pfister SM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="19" name="Weinstein LS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Pomeroy SL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Gilbertson RJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Rubin JB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Hou Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Wechsler-Reya R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Taylor MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Lu QR" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25150496</PMID><DOI>10.1038/nm.3666</DOI><KST>B062</KST><KEYWORD>MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHWAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INHIBITOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>brain</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PRIMARY CILIUM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SHH MEDULLOBLASTOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COUPLED RECEPTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>KINASE-A</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52855</publishedID><Artikel>Women are more strongly affected by dizziness in static magnetic fields of magnetic resonance imaging scanners</Artikel><Journal>Neuroreport</Journal><ABSTr>Increasing field strengths in MRI necessitate the examination of potential side effects. Previously reported results have been contradictory, possibly caused by imbalanced samples. We aimed to examine whether special groups of people are more prone to develop side effects that might have led to contradictory results in previous studies. We examined the occurrence of sensory side effects in static magnetic fields of MRI scanners of 1.5, 3, and 7 T and a mock scanner in 41 healthy participants. The contribution of field strength, sex, age, and attention to bodily processes, and stress hormone levels to the sensation of dizziness was examined in separate univariate analyses and in a joint analysis that included all variables. Field strength and sex were significant factors in the joint analysis (P=0.001), with women being more strongly affected than men by dizziness in higher static magnetic fields. This effect was not mediated by the other variables such as attention to bodily symptoms or stress hormones. Further research needs to elucidate the underlying factors of increased dizziness in women in static magnetic fields in MRI. We hypothesize that imbalanced samples of earlier studies might be one reason for previous contradictory results on the side effects of static magnetic fields.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>25 (14), 1081-1084</Feld596><PubVol>25</PubVol><PubIss>14</PubIss><StrtPage>1081</StrtPage><EndPage>1084</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Heinrich A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Szostek A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Meyer P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Reinhard I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Gilles M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Paslakis G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Rauschenberg J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Groebner J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Semmler W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Deuschle M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Meyer-Lindenberg A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Flor H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Nees F" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25089803</PMID><DOI>10.1097/WNR.0000000000000225</DOI><KST>E020</KST><KEYWORD>CASE-CROSSOVER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>8 TESLA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Cognition</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SYSTEM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPOSURE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52856</publishedID><Artikel>The molecular phenotype of endocapillary proliferation: novel therapeutic targets for IgA nephropathy</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is a clinically and pathologically heterogeneous disease. Endocapillary proliferation is associated with higher risk of progressive disease, and clinical studies suggest that corticosteroids mitigate this risk. However, corticosteroids are associated with protean cellular effects and significant toxicity. Furthermore the precise mechanism by which they modulate kidney injury in IgAN is not well delineated. To better understand molecular pathways involved in the development of endocapillary proliferation and to identify novel specific therapeutic targets, we evaluated the glomerular transcriptome of microdissected kidney biopsies from 22 patients with IgAN. Endocapillary proliferation was defined according to the Oxford scoring system independently by 3 nephropathologists. We analyzed mRNA expression using microarrays and identified transcripts differentially expressed in patients with endocapillary proliferation compared to IgAN without endocapillary lesions. Next, we employed both transcription factor analysis and in silico drug screening and confirmed that the endocapillary proliferation transcriptome is significantly enriched with pathways that can be impacted by corticosteroids. With this approach we also identified novel therapeutic targets and bioactive small molecules that may be considered for therapeutic trials for the treatment of IgAN, including resveratrol and hydroquinine. In summary, we have defined the distinct molecular profile of a pathologic phenotype associated with progressive renal insufficiency in IgAN. Exploration of the pathways associated with endocapillary proliferation confirms a molecular basis for the clinical effectiveness of corticosteroids in this subgroup of IgAN, and elucidates new therapeutic strategies for IgAN.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (8), e103413-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>e103413</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Hodgin JB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Berthier CC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="John R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Groene E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Porubsky S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Groene HJ" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Herzenberg AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Scholey JW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Hladunewich M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Cattran DC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Kretzler M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Reich HN" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25133636</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0103413</DOI><KST>G130</KST><KEYWORD>validation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INHIBITION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>immunosuppression</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMMUNITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Oxford classification</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RESVERATROL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLUCOCORTICOIDS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MULTICENTER APPLICATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52857</publishedID><Artikel>Intracerebral interleukin-10 injection modulates post-ischemic neuroinflammation: an experimental microarray study</Artikel><Journal>Neuroscience Letters</Journal><ABSTr>Stroke induces a profound neuroinflammatory reaction that leads to secondary cerebral tissue injury. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a key anti-inflammatory cytokine that is endogenously produced by immune cells and limits this inflammatory reaction. Previously, therapeutic administration of IL-10 has been shown to be neuroprotective in experimental stroke. However, the signaling pathways affected by this approach are largely unknown. The aim of this study was to verify the neuroprotective effects of IL-10 in an experimental mouse stroke model and to analyze the pathways modulated by this approach. Therefore, we performed a whole genome microarray analysis comparing the cerebral gene expression profile at two time points after cortical stroke in IL-10-treated and control C57Bl/6J mice. We administered IL-10 locally by intracerebroventricular injection. We were able to validate a reduction of infarct volume by IL-10 administration and characterized the kinetics of endogenous cerebral IL-10 expression after stroke. The microarray analysis revealed that IL-10 treatment effectively downregulated pro-inflammatory signaling cascades which were upregulated by the ischemic lesion in the acute phase after the stroke. This is the first study characterizing the global gene regulation profile of IL-10 immunotherapy for ischemic stroke. Our results emphasize the key role of IL-10 as a neuroprotective cytokine and suggest several novel downstream pathways for further investigation to better understand the mechanisms of post-stroke neuroinflammation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>579 (), 18-23</Feld596><PubVol>579</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>18</StrtPage><EndPage>23</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Liesz A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Bauer A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Hoheisel JD" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Veltkamp R" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25019688</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.neulet.2014.07.003</DOI><KST>B070</KST><KEYWORD>MURINE EXPERIMENTAL STROKE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIMIT CNS INFLAMMATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEUROLOGIC DEFICITS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PERMANENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REGULATORY T-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FOCAL CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INFARCT VOLUME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>brain</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MICE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52858</publishedID><Artikel>CCHCR1 interacts with EDC4, suggesting its localization in P-bodies</Artikel><Journal>Experimental Cell Research</Journal><ABSTr>Coiled-coil alpha-helical rod protein 1 (CCHCR1) is suggested as a candidate biomarker for psoriasis for more than a decade but its function remains poorly understood because of the inconsistent findings in the literature. CCHCR1 protein is suggested to be localized in the cytoplasm, nucleus, mitochondria, or centrosome and to regulate various cellular functions, including steroidogenesis, proliferation, differentiation, and cytoskeleton organization. In this study, we attempted to find a consensus between these findings by identifying the interaction partners of CCHCR1 using co-immunoprecipiation with a stable cell line expressing EGFP-tagged CCHCR1. Out of more than 100 co-immunoprecipitants identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), the enhancer of mRNA-decapping protein 4 (EDC4), which is a processing body (P-body) component, was particularly found to be the major interacting partner of CCHCR1. Confocal imaging confirmed the localization of CCHCR1 in P-bodies and its N-terminus is required for this subcellular localization, suggesting that CCHCR1 is a novel P-body component. As P-bodies are the site for mRNA metabolism, our findings provide a molecular basis for the function of CCHCR1, any disruption of which may affect the transcriptome of the cell, and causing abnormal cell functions.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>327 (1), 12-23</Feld596><PubVol>327</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>12</StrtPage><EndPage>23</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ling YH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Wong CC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Li KW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Chan KM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Boukamp P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Liu WK" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24858563</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.yexcr.2014.05.008</DOI><KST>A110</KST><KEYWORD>SEQUENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANDIDATE GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUSCEPTIBILITY GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEIN-INTERACTION NETWORK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STRESS GRANULES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROCESSING BODY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COILED COILS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PSORIASIS-VULGARIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HCR GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HLA-C</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52861</publishedID><Artikel>Heterozygous FGF8 mutations in patients presenting cryptorchidism and multiple VATER/VACTERL features without limb anormalies</Artikel><Journal>Birth Defects Research / A, Clinical Molecular Teratology</Journal><ABSTr>Background: The acronym VATER/VACTERL association describes the combination of at least three of the following cardinal features: vertebral defects, anorectal malformations, cardiac defects, tracheoesophageal fistula with or without esophageal atresia, renal malformations, and limb defects. Although fibroblast growth factor-8 (FGF8) mutations have mainly found in patients with Kallmann syndrome, mice with a hypomorphic Fgf8 allele or complete gene invalidation display, aside from gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency, parts or even the entire spectrum of human VATER/VACTERL association. Methods: We performed FGF8 gene analysis in 49 patients with VATER/VACTERL association and 27 patients presenting with a VATER/VACTERL-like phenotype (two cardinal features). Results: We identified two heterozygous FGF8 mutations in patients displaying either VATER/VACTERL association (p.Gly29_Arg34dup) or a VATER/VACTERL-like phenotype (p.Pro26Leu) without limb anomalies. Whereas the duplication mutation has not been reported before, p.Pro26Leu was once observed in a Kallmann syndrome patient. Both our patients had additional bilateral cryptorchidism, a key phenotypic feature in males with FGF8 associated Kallmann syndrome. Each mutation was paternally inherited. Besides delayed puberty in both and additional unilateral cryptorchidism in one of the fathers, they were otherwise healthy. Serum hormone levels downstream the gonadotropin-releasing hormone in both patients and their fathers were within normal range. Conclusion: Our results suggest FGF8 mutations to contribute to the formation of the VATER/VACTERL association. Further studies are needed to support this observation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>100 (10), 750-759</Feld596><PubVol>100</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>750</StrtPage><EndPage>759</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Zeidler C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Woelfle J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Draaken M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Mughai SS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Große G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hilger AC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Dworschak GC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Boemers TM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Jenetzky E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Zwink N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Lacher M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Schmidt D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Schmiedeke E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Grasshoff-Derr S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Märzheuser S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Holland Cunz S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Schäfer M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Bartels E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Keppler K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Palta M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Leonhardt J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Kujath C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Rißmann A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Nöthen MM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Reutter H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Ludwig M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25131394</PMID><DOI>10.1002/bdra.23278</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>GONADOTROPIN-RELEASING-HORMONE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TESTICULAR DESCENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HETEROTAXY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DEFICIENCY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANORECTAL-MALFORMATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VACTERL-ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VATER ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IDENTIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>etiology</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52864</publishedID><Artikel>Myelodysplastic cells in patients reprogram mesenchymal stromal cells to establish a transplantable stem cell niche disease unit</Artikel><Journal>Cell Stem Cell</Journal><ABSTr>Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are a heterogeneous group of myeloid neoplasms with defects in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) and possibly the HSPC niche. Here, we show that patient-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MDS MSCs) display a disturbed differentiation program and are essential for the propagation of MDS-initiating Lin(-)CD34(+)CD38(-) stem cells in orthotopic xenografts. Overproduction of niche factors such as CDH2 (N-Cadherin), IGFBP2, VEGFA, and LIF is associated with the ability of MDS MSCs to enhance MDS expansion. These factors represent putative therapeutic targets in order to disrupt critical hematopoietic-stromal interactions in MDS. Finally, healthy MSCs adopt MDS MSC-like molecular features when exposed to hematopoietic MDS cells, indicative of an instructive remodeling of the microenvironment. Therefore, this patient-derived xenograft model provides functional and molecular evidence that MDS is a complex disease that involves both the hematopoietic and stromal compartments. The resulting deregulated expression of niche factors may well also be a feature of other hematopoietic malignancies.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>14 (6), 824-837</Feld596><PubVol>14</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>824</StrtPage><EndPage>837</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Medyouf H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Mossner M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Jann JC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Nolte F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Raffel S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Herrmann C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Lier A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Eisen C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Nowak V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Zens B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Muedder K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Klein C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Oblander J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Fey S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Vogler J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Fabarius A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Riedl E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Roehl H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Kohlmann A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Staller M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Haferlach C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Mueller N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="John T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Platzbecker U" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="24" name="Metzgeroth G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Hofmann WK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Trumpp A*" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="27" name="Nowak D* (* joint last author and corresponding author)" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24704494</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.stem.2014.02.014</DOI><KST>A010</KST><KST>B080</KST><KST>V960</KST><KST>L301</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHOGENESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DELETION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>microenvironment</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ROBUSTNESS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INVOLVEMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENGRAFTMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACUTE MYELOID-LEUKEMIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REMISSION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52865</publishedID><Artikel>Dietary intake of acrylamide and endometrial cancer risk in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort</Artikel><Journal>British Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Three prospective studies have evaluated the association between dietary acrylamide intake and endometrial cancer (EC) risk with inconsistent results. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between acrylamide intake and EC risk: for overall EC, for type-I EC, and in never smokers and never users of oral contraceptives (OCs). Smoking is a source of acrylamide, and OC use is a protective factor for EC risk. METHODS: Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for the association between acrylamide intake and EC risk in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort. Acrylamide intake was estimated from the EU acrylamide monitoring database, which was matched with EPIC questionnaire-based food consumption data. Acrylamide intake was energy adjusted using the residual method. RESULTS: No associations were observed between acrylamide intake and overall EC (n=1382) or type-I EC risk (n=627). We observed increasing relative risks for type-I EC with increasing acrylamide intake among women who both never smoked and were non-users of OCs (HRQ5vsQ1: 1.97, 95% CI: 1.08-3.62; likelihood ratio test (LRT) P-value: 0.01, n=203). CONCLUSIONS: Dietary intake of acrylamide was not associated with overall or type-I EC risk; however, positive associations with type I were observed in women who were both non-users of OCs and never smokers.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>111 (5), 987-997</Feld596><PubVol>111</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>987</StrtPage><EndPage>997</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Obon-Santacana M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Kaaks R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Slimani N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Lujan-Barroso L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Freisling H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Ferrari P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Dossus L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Chabbert-Buffet N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Baglietto L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Fortner RT" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Olsen A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Menendez V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Molina-Montes E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Larranaga N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Chirlaque MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Ardanaz E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Wareham N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Travis RC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Lu Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Merritt MA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Benetou V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Trichopoulos D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Saieva C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Sieri S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Sacerdote C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Galasso R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Wirfalt E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Ericson U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Idahl A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Ohlson N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Skeie G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Gram IT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Onland-Moret NC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Duell EJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24937665</PMID><DOI>10.1038/bjc.2014.328</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>OVARIAN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VALIDITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>QUESTIONNAIRE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BREAST</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPOSURE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52866</publishedID><Artikel>Retrotransposon Alu is enriched in the epichromatin of HL-60 cells</Artikel><Journal>Nucleus</Journal><ABSTr>Epichromatin, the surface of chromatin facing the nuclear envelope in an interphase nucleus, reveals a "rim" staining pattern with specific mouse monoclonal antibodies against histone H2A/H2B/DNA and phosphatidylserine epitopes.

They also exhibited enrichment of the AluS subfamily and of Alu oligomers. Furthermore, mapping epichromatin regions to the human chromosomes revealed highly similar localization patterns in the various cell states and with the different antibodies. Comparisons with available epigenetic databases suggested that epichromatin is neither "classical" heterochromatin nor highly expressing genes, implying another function at the surface of interphase chromatin. A modified chromatin immunoprecipitation procedure (xxChIP) was developed because the studied antibodies react generally with mononucleosomes and lysed chromatin. A second fixation is necessary to securely attach the antibodies to the epichromatin epitopes of the intact nucleus.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>5 (3), 237-246</Feld596><PubVol>5</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>237</StrtPage><EndPage>246</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Olins AL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Ishaque N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Chotewutmontri S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Langowski J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Olins DE" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24824428</PMID><DOI>10.4161/nucl.29141</DOI><KST>B080</KST><KST>B040</KST><KST>W190</KST><KST>G200</KST><KEYWORD>SEQUENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHROMATIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ELEMENTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN GENOME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DOMAINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ORGANIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENVELOPE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HOUSEKEEPING GENES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHROMOSOMES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NUCLEAR LAMINA INTERACTIONS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52867</publishedID><Artikel>Bi-modal Non-rigid Registration of Brain MRI Data with Deconvolution of Joint Statistics</Artikel><Journal>IEEE Transactions on Image Processing</Journal><ABSTr>A brain MRI protocol typically includes several imaging contrasts that can provide complementary information by highlighting different tissue properties. The acquired datasets often need to be co-registered or placed in a standard anatomic space before any further processing. Current registration methods particularly for multicontrast data are computationally very intensive, their resolution is lower than that of the images, and their distance metric and its optimization can be limiting. In this work a novel and effective non-rigid registration method is proposed that is based on the restoration of the joint statistics of pairs of such images. The registration is performed with the deconvolution of the joint statistics with an adaptive Wiener filter. The deconvolved statistics are forced back to the spatial domain to estimate a preliminary registration. The spatial transformation is also regularized with Gaussian spatial smoothing. The registration method has been compared with the B-Splines method implemented in 3DSlicer and with the SyN method implemented in the ANTs toolkit. The validation has been performed with a simulated Shepp-Logan phantom, a BrainWeb phantom, the real data of the NIREP database, and real multi-contrast datasets of healthy volunteers. The proposed method has shown improved comparative accuracy as well as analytical efficiency.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (9), 3999-4009</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>3999</StrtPage><EndPage>4009</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Pilutti D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Strumia M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Hadjidemetriou S" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25020093</PMID><DOI>10.1109/TIP.2014.2336546</DOI><KST>L601</KST><KEYWORD>IMAGE REGISTRATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BREAST</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GRAPH-CUTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTUAL-INFORMATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52868</publishedID><Artikel>A method to increase the nominal range resolution of a stack of parallel-plate ionization chambers</Artikel><Journal>Physics in Medicine and Biology</Journal><ABSTr>A detector prototype based on a stack of 61 parallel-plate ionisation chambers (PPIC) interleaved with absorber plates of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) was assembled for transmission imaging purposes in ion beam therapy. The thickness of the absorber sheets in the PPIC stack determines the nominal range resolution of the detector. In the current set-up, 3 mm PMMA slabs are used. The signal of the 61 active channels of the stack thereby provides a discrete approximation of the Bragg curve in the detector. In this work, a data processing method to increase the range resolution (MIRR) in a stack of ionization chambers is presented. In the MIRR the position of the maximum of the Bragg curve is deduced from the ratio of measured signals in adjacent PPIC channels. The method is developed based on Bragg curves obtained from Monte Carlo simulations and validated with experimental data of a wedge-shaped PMMA phantom acquired with the PPIC stack using carbon ion beams. The influence of the initial beam energy and of phantom inhomogeneities on the MIRR is quantitatively evaluated. Systematic errors as well as inaccuracies related to signal noise are discussed and quantified. It is shown that with the MIRR an increased range resolution of 0.7 mm PMMA equivalent or 0.8 mm water equivalent thickness is achieved for the considered experimental data.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>59 (18), 5501-15</Feld596><PubVol>59</PubVol><PubIss>18</PubIss><StrtPage>5501</StrtPage><EndPage>15</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Rinaldi I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Brons S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Jaekel O" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Voss B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Parodi K" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25170567</PMID><DOI>10.1088/0031-9155/59/18/5501</DOI><KST>E040</KST><KEYWORD>PROTON COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEAVY-ION CT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DETECTOR SYSTEM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THERAPY CENTER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATIENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CT-HOUNSFIELD UNITS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>radiography</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52869</publishedID><Artikel>Thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroglobulin, and thyroid hormones and risk of differentiated thyroid carcinoma: the EPIC study</Artikel><Journal>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Increased levels of thyroglobulin (Tg) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) are associated with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (TC) risk, but strong epidemiological evidence is lacking. METHODS: Three hundred fifty-seven incident TC case patients (n = 300 women and 57 men; mean age at blood collection = 51.5 years) were identified in the EPIC cohort study and matched with 2 (women) or 3 (men) control subjects using incidence density sampling. Matching included study center, sex, age, date, time, and fasting status at blood collection. Levels of total and free (f) thyroxine (T4) and triiodo-thyronine (T3), TSH, Tg, and anti-Tg antibodies (TgAb) were measured by commercially available immunoassays. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed using conditional logistic regression. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: TC risk was positively associated with Tg (OR for the highest vs lowest quartile = 9.15; 95% CI = 5.28 to 15.90; P &lt; .001) and negatively associated with TSH level (OR = 0.56; 95% CI = 0.38 to 0.81; P = .001). Odds ratios were not modified by adjustment for weight and height and were consistent across sexes, age groups, and countries. The association with Tg was stronger in follicular than papillary TC. The odds ratio for TgAb-positivity was 1.50 (95% CI = 1.05 to 2.15; P = .03). Among case patients, TSH level was stable over time, whereas Tg level was higher in proximity to TC diagnosis. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 57% and 74% for TSH and Tg level, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: High Tg levels precede by up to 8 years the detection of TC, pointing to a long sojourn time of the disease. Low TSH levels may predispose to TC onset. Neither marker has sufficient accuracy to be a screening test.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>106 (6), Art. Nr.: dju097-</Feld596><PubVol>106</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>Art.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: As an extension of a previous study, the cervical spinal cord of rats was irradiated with single doses of carbon ions at 6 positions of a 6-cm spread-out Bragg peak (16-99 keV/mum). The TD50 values (dose at 50% complication probability) were determined according to dose-response curves for the development of paresis grade 2 within an observation time of 300 days. The RBEs were calculated using TD50 for photons of our previous study. RESULTS: Minimum latency time was found to be dose-dependent, but not significantly LET-dependent. The TD50 values for the onset of paresis grade 2 within 300 days were 19.5 +/- 0.4 Gy (16 keV/mum), 18.4 +/- 0.4 Gy (21 keV/mum), 17.7 +/- 0.3 Gy (36 keV/mum), 16.1 +/- 1.2 Gy (45 keV/mum), 14.6 +/- 0.5 Gy (66 keV/mum), and 14.8 +/- 0.5 Gy (99 keV/mum). The corresponding RBEs increased from 1.26 +/- 0.05 (16 keV/mum) up to 1.68 +/- 0.08 at 66 keV/mum. Unexpectedly, the RBE at 99 keV/mum was comparable to that at 66 keV/mum. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest a linear relation between RBE and LET at high doses for late effects in the spinal cord. Together with additional data from ongoing fractionated irradiation experiments, these data will provide an extended database to systematically benchmark RBE models for further improvements of carbon ion treatment planning.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>90 (1), 63-70</Feld596><PubVol>90</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>63</StrtPage><EndPage>70</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Saager M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Glowa C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Peschke P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Brons S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Scholz M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Huber PE" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Debus J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Karger CP" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24998894</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.ijrobp.2014.05.008</DOI><KST>E050</KST><KST>E040</KST><KST>E055</KST><KEYWORD>SINGLE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TOLERANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>radiotherapy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTON</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>X-RAYS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL-SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CLINICAL RADIATION MYELOPATHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LATENT PERIOD</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52871</publishedID><Artikel>Pre-diagnostic smoking behaviour and poorer prognosis in a German breast cancer patient cohort - Differential effects by tumour subtype, NAT2 status, BMI and alcohol intake</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Epidemiology</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Inconsistent associations of smoking and breast cancer-specific mortality might be explained by subgroups of patients with different susceptibility to harmful effects of smoking. METHODS: We used a prospective cohort of 3340 postmenopausal breast cancer patients aged 50-74 and diagnosed with invasive tumours 2001-2005 in Germany, with a median follow-up time of 6 years. The effect of pre-diagnostic smoking behaviour on mortality outcomes and risk of recurrence was investigated using delayed entry Cox regression analysis. Differential effects according to N-acetyltransferase (NAT2) status, BMI, alcohol consumption, and tumour subtypes were assessed. RESULTS: Overall, smoking at time of breast cancer diagnosis versus never/former smoking was non-significantly associated with increased breast cancer-specific mortality and risk of recurrence (HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.93-1.64, and HR 1.29, 95% CI 0.95-1.75, respectively). Associations were consistently stronger in NAT2 slow than in fast acetylators for all mortality outcomes. Breast cancer-specific mortality was significantly increased in smokers with NAT2 slow acetylating status (HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.13-2.79) but not in those with fast acetylating status (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.60-1.98; Pheterogeneity=0.19). Smoking was associated with significantly poorer outcomes for triple negative and luminal A-like tumours (e.g. all-cause mortality: HR 1.93, 95% CI 1.02-3.65, and HR 2.08, 95% CI 1.40-3.10, respectively). Risk of recurrence was significantly increased for women with HER2 positive tumours (HR 3.64, 95% CI 1.22-10.8). There was significant heterogeneity by BMI for non-breast cancer-specific mortality (&lt;25 kg/m(2): HR 2.52, 95% CI 1.52-4.15 vs. &gt;/=25 kg/m(2): HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.38-2.36; Pheterogeneity=0.04). CONCLUSION: The harmful effects of smoking may be particularly relevant for certain subgroups of breast cancer patients. This may include patients with NAT2 slow acetylation status or with tumour subtypes other than luminal B, such as luminal A tumours who usually have a rather good prognosis. Emphasis on smoking cessation programmes for all cancer patients should be strengthened.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>38 (4), 419-426</Feld596><PubVol>38</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>419</StrtPage><EndPage>426</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Seibold P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Vrieling A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Heinz J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Obi N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Sinn HP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Flesch-Janys D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Chang-Claude J" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24950597</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.canep.2014.05.006</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>CONSUMPTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WOMEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOTYPES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIAGNOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52872</publishedID><Artikel>Dietary fat intake and development of specific breast cancer subtypes</Artikel><Journal>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</Journal><ABSTr>We prospectively evaluated fat intake as predictor of developing breast cancer (BC) subtypes defined by estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor 2 receptor (HER2), in a large (n = 337327) heterogeneous cohort of women, with 10062 BC case patients after 11.5 years, estimating BC hazard ratios (HRs) by Cox proportional hazard modeling.

Both lineages are believed to originate from a common progenitor cell, yet the cellular and molecular identity of these bipotent TEC progenitors/stem cells remains ill defined. Here we identify rare stromal cells in the murine adult thymus, which under low-attachment conditions formed spheres (termed "thymospheres"). These thymosphere-forming cells (TSFCs) displayed the stemness features of being slow cycling, self-renewing, and bipotent. TSFCs could be significantly enriched based on their distinct surface antigen phenotype. The FoxN1 transcription factor was dispensable for TSFCs maintenance in situ and for commitment to the medullary and cortical TEC lineages. In summary, this study presents the characterization of the adult thymic epithelial stem cells and demonstrates the dispensability of FoxN1 function for their stemness.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>41 (2), 257-269</Feld596><PubVol>41</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>257</StrtPage><EndPage>269</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ucar A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Ucar O" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Klug P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Matt S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Brunk F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hofmann TG" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Kyewski B" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25148026</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.immuni.2014.07.005</DOI><KST>D090</KST><KST>A210</KST><KEYWORD>PROGENITOR-CELL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROMISCUOUS GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AIRE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MAMMARY-GLAND</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>organogenesis</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>microenvironment</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOUSE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENERATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VITRO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POPULATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52875</publishedID><Artikel>Prosurvival function of the cellular apoptosis susceptibility/importin-alpha1 transport cycle is repressed by p53 in liver cancer</Artikel><Journal>Hepatology</Journal><ABSTr>Proteins of the karyopherin superfamily including importins and exportins represent an essential part of the nucleocytoplasmic transport machinery. However, the functional relevance and regulation of karyopherins in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is poorly understood. Here we identified cellular apoptosis susceptibility (CAS, exportin-2) and its transport substrate importin-alpha1 (imp-alpha1) among significantly up-regulated transport factor genes in HCC. Disruption of the CAS/imp-alpha1 transport cycle by RNAi in HCC cell lines resulted in decreased tumor cell growth and increased apoptosis. The apoptotic phenotype upon CAS depletion could be recapitulated by direct knockdown of the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) and partially reverted by XIAP overexpression. In addition, XIAP and CAS mRNA expression levels were correlated in HCC patient samples (r=0.463; P&lt;0.01), supporting the in vivo relevance of our findings. Furthermore, quantitative mass spectrometry analyses of murine HCC samples (p53-/- versus p53+/+) indicated higher protein expression of CAS and imp-alpha1 in p53-/- tumors. Consistent with a role of p53 in regulating the CAS/imp-alpha1 transport cycle, we observed that both transport factors were repressed upon p53 induction in a p21-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: The CAS/imp-alpha1 transport cycle is linked to XIAP and is required to maintain tumor cell survival in HCC. Moreover, CAS and imp-alpha1 are targets of p53-mediated repression, which represents a novel aspect of p53's ability to control tumor cell growth in hepatocarcinogenesis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>60 (3), 884-895</Feld596><PubVol>60</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>884</StrtPage><EndPage>895</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Winkler J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Ori A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Holzer K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Sticht C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Dauch D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Eiteneuer EM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Pinna F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Geffers R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Ehemann V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Andres-Pons A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Breuhahn K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Longerich T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Bermejo JL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Gretz N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Zender L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Schirmacher P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="16" name="Beck M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Singer S" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24799195</PMID><DOI>10.1002/hep.27207</DOI><KST>L801</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MECHANISM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COPY-NUMBER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUSCEPTIBILITY GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN HOMOLOG</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMPORTIN-ALPHA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TARGET GENES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>protein expression</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SEGREGATION GENE CSE1</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52876</publishedID><Artikel>Reduced expression of the retinoblastoma protein shows that the related signaling pathway is essential for mediating the antineoplastic activity of erufosine</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>Erufosine is a new antineoplastic agent of the group of alkylphosphocholines, which interferes with signal transduction and induces apoptosis in various leukemic and tumor cell lines. The present study was designed to examine for the first time the mechanism of resistance to erufosine in malignant cells with permanently reduced expression of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein. Bearing in mind the high number of malignancies with reduced level of this tumor-suppressor, this investigation was deemed important for using erufosine, alone or in combination, in patients with compromised RB1 gene expression. For this purpose, clones of the leukemic T-cell line SKW-3 were used, which had been engineered to constantly express differently low Rb levels. The alkylphosphocholine induced apoptosis, stimulated the expression of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 and inhibited the synthesis of cyclin D3, thereby causing a G2 phase cell cycle arrest and death of cells with wild type Rb expression. In contrast, Rb-deficiency impeded the changes induced by erufosine in the expression of these proteins and abrogated the induction of G2 arrest, which was correlated with reduced antiproliferative and anticlonogenic activities of the compound. In conclusion, analysis of our results showed for the first time that the Rb signaling pathway is essential for mediating the antineoplastic activity of erufosine and its efficacy in patients with malignant diseases may be predicted by determining the Rb status.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (7), e100950-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>e100950</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Zaharieva MM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Kirilov M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Chai M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Berger SM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Konstantinov S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Berger MR" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24987858</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0100950</DOI><KST>A170</KST><KST>G401</KST><KEYWORD>ABL TYROSINE KINASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACUTE MYELOID-LEUKEMIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>C-ABL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MAMMALIAN-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA-DAMAGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INDUCED APOPTOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL-CYCLE CONTROL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VITRO</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52877</publishedID><Artikel>HPVdb: a data mining system for knowledge discovery in human papillomavirus with applications in T cell immunology and vaccinology</Artikel><Journal>Database</Journal><ABSTr>High-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the causes of many cancers, including cervical, anal, vulvar, vaginal, penile and oropharyngeal. To facilitate diagnosis, prognosis and characterization of these cancers, it is necessary to make full use of the immunological data on HPV available through publications, technical reports and databases. These data vary in granularity, quality and complexity. The extraction of knowledge from the vast amount of immunological data using data mining techniques remains a challenging task. To support integration of data and knowledge in virology and vaccinology, we developed a framework called KB-builder to streamline the development and deployment of web-accessible immunological knowledge systems. The framework consists of seven major functional modules, each facilitating a specific aspect of the knowledgebase construction process. Using KB-builder, we constructed the Human Papillomavirus T cell Antigen Database (HPVdb). It contains 2781 curated antigen entries of antigenic proteins derived from 18 genotypes of high-risk HPV and 18 genotypes of low-risk HPV. The HPVdb also catalogs 191 verified T cell epitopes and 45 verified human leukocyte antigen (HLA) ligands. Primary amino acid sequences of HPV antigens were collected and annotated from the UniProtKB. T cell epitopes and HLA ligands were collected from data mining of scientific literature and databases. The data were subject to extensive quality control (redundancy elimination, error detection and vocabulary consolidation). A set of computational tools for an in-depth analysis, such as sequence comparison using BLAST search, multiple alignments of antigens, classification of HPV types based on cancer risk, T cell epitope/HLA ligand visualization, T cell epitope/HLA ligand conservation analysis and sequence variability analysis, has been integrated within the HPVdb. Predicted Class I and Class II HLA binding peptides for 15 common HLA alleles are included in this database as putative targets. HPVdb is a knowledge-based system that integrates curated data and information with tailored analysis tools to facilitate data mining for HPV vaccinology and immunology. To our best knowledge, HPVdb is a unique data source providing a comprehensive list of HPV antigens and peptides.

From radiation and chemotherapy resistance to the increased risk of metastasis, low oxygen concentrations in tumors have caused patients with many types of tumors to respond poorly to conventional cancer therapies. It is clear that patients with high levels of tumor hypoxia have a poorer overall treatment response and that the magnitude of hypoxia is an important prognostic factor. As a result, the development of methods to measure tumor hypoxia using invasive and noninvasive techniques has become desirable to the clinical oncology community. A variety of imaging modalities have been established to visualize hypoxia in vivo. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, in particular, has played a key role for imaging tumor hypoxia because of the development of hypoxia-specific radiolabelled agents. Consequently, this technique is increasingly used in the clinic for a wide variety of cancer types. Following a broad overview of the complexity of tumor hypoxia and measurement techniques to date, this article will focus specifically on the accuracy and reproducibility of PET imaging to quantify tumor hypoxia. Despite numerous advances in the field of PET imaging for hypoxia, we continue to search for the ideal hypoxia tracer to both qualitatively and quantitatively define the tumor hypoxic volume in a clinical setting to optimize treatments and predict response in cancer patients.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>181 (4), 335-349</Feld596><PubVol>181</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>335</StrtPage><EndPage>349</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kelada OJ" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Carlson DJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24673257</PMID><DOI>10.1667/RR13590.1</DOI><KST>E040</KST><KEYWORD>SQUAMOUS-CELL CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LUNG-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADVANCED HEAD</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NECK-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHASE-I TRIAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MODULATED RADIATION-THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>F-18 FLUOROMISONIDAZOLE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ELECTRON-PARAMAGNETIC-RESONANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLUCOSE METABOLIC-RATE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>F-18-FLUOROMISONIDAZOLE PET</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52883</publishedID><Artikel>EANO guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of anaplastic gliomas and glioblastoma</Artikel><Journal>Lancet Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>This guideline provides recommendations for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for patients with malignant gliomas.

Implementation of the recommendations summarised here will need interdisciplinary structures of care for patients with brain tumours and structured processes of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>15 (9), e395-e403</Feld596><PubVol>15</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>e395</StrtPage><EndPage>e403</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Weller M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="van den Bent M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Hopkins K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Tonn JC" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Stupp R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Falini A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Cohen-Jonathan-Moyal E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Frappaz D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Henriksson R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Balana C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Chinot O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Ram Z" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Reifenberger G" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Soffietti R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Wick W" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25079102</PMID><KST>G370</KST><KST>L401</KST><KST>L701</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>BEVACIZUMAB PLUS IRINOTECAN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DOSE-INTENSE TEMOZOLOMIDE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHASE-III TRIAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECURRENT GLIOBLASTOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HIGH-GRADE GLIOMAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TERM-FOLLOW-UP</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MALIGNANT GLIOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CLINICAL-TRIAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RANDOMIZED-TRIAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RADIATION-THERAPY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52944</publishedID><Artikel>A multiplex method for the detection of serum antibodies against in silico-predicted tumor antigens</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Immunology Immunotherapy</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>63 (12), 1251-1259</Feld596><PubVol>63</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>1251</StrtPage><EndPage>1259</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Reuschenbach, M."

The deleterious consequences are cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV accounts the most frequent cause for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver transplantation (LT) in the western world. The underlying molecular mechanisms how HCV promotes tumor development are largely unknown. There is some in vitro and in vivo evidence that HCV interferes with the tumor suppressor PML and may thereby importantly contribute to the HCV-associated pathogenesis with respect to the development of HCC. The tumor suppressor protein "promyelocytic leukemia" (PML) has been implicated in the regulation of important cellular processes like differentiation and apoptosis. In cancer biology, PML and its associated nuclear bodies (NBs) have initially attracted intense interest due to its role in the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). More recently, loss of PML has been implicated in human cancers of various histologic origins. Moreover, number and intensity of PML-NBs increase in response to interferons (IFNs) and there is evidence that PML-NBs may represent preferential targets in viral infections. Thus, PML could not only play a role in the mechanisms of the antiviral action of IFNs but may also be involved in a direct oncogenic effect of the HCV on hepatocytes. This review aims to summarise current knowledge about HCV-related liver carcinogenesis and to discuss a potential role of the nuclear body protein PML for this this hard-to-treat cancer.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>20 (35), 12367-12371</Feld596><PubVol>20</PubVol><PubIss>35</PubIss><StrtPage>12367</StrtPage><EndPage>12371</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Herzer K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Gerken G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Hofmann TG" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25253937</PMID><DOI>10.3748/wjg.v20.i35.12367</DOI><KST>A210</KST><KEYWORD>hepatocarcinogenesis</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NECROSIS-FACTOR-ALPHA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>p53</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>APOPTOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROMYELOCYTIC LEUKEMIA PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VIRUS CORE PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA-DAMAGE RESPONSE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUPPRESSOR PML</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52963</publishedID><Artikel>Mouse models of human cancer</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Research</Journal><ABSTr>The Helmholtz Alliance Preclinical Comprehensive Cancer Center (PCCC; www.helmholtz-pccc.de) hosted the "1st International Kloster Seeon Meeting on Mouse Models of Human Cancer" in the Seeon monastery (Germany) from March 8 to 11, 2014.

phenotype of suspended cells using high-throughput deformability measurements and computational modeling</Artikel><Journal>Journal of biomechanics</Journal><ABSTr>Mechanical cell properties play an important role in many basic biological functions, including motility, adhesion, proliferation and differentiation. There is a growing body of evidence that the mechanical cell phenotype can be used for detection and, possibly, treatment of various diseases, including cancer. Understanding of pathological mechanisms requires investigation of the relationship between constitutive properties and major structural components of cells, i.e., the nucleus and cytoskeleton. While the contribution of actin und microtubules to cellular rheology has been extensively studied in the past, the role of intermediate filaments has been scarcely investigated up to now. Here, for the first time we compare the effects of drug-induced disruption of actin and vimentin intermediate filaments on mechanical properties of suspended NK cells using high-throughput deformability measurements and computational modeling. Although, molecular mechanisms of actin and vimentin disruption by the applied cytoskeletal drugs, Cytochalasin-D and Withaferin-A, are different, cell softening in both cases can be attributed to reduction of the effective density and stiffness of filament networks. Our experimental data suggest that actin and vimentin deficient cells exhibit, in average, 41% and 20% higher deformability in comparison to untreated control. 3D Finite Element simulation is performed to quantify the contribution of cortical actin and perinuclear vimentin to mechanical phenotype of the whole cell. Our simulation provides quantitative estimates for decreased filament stiffness in drug-treated cells and predicts more than two-fold increase of the strain magnitude in the perinuclear vimentin layer of actin deficient cells relatively to untreated control. Thus, the mechanical function of vimentin becomes particularly essential in motile and proliferating cells that have to dynamically remodel the cortical actin network. These insights add functional cues to frequently observed overexpression of vimentin in diverse types of cancer and underline the role of vimentin targeting drugs, such as Withaferin-A, as a potent cancerostatic supplement.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>47 (11), 2598-2605</Feld596><PubVol>47</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>2598</StrtPage><EndPage>2605</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Gladilin E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Gonzalez P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Eils R" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24952458</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.jbiomech.2014.05.020</DOI><KST>B080</KST><KEYWORD>VISCOELASTIC PROPERTIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>acrylamide</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPITHELIAL-MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NETWORKS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>fibroblasts</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DEFORMATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>cytoskeleton</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CYTOCHALASIN</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52966</publishedID><Artikel>Resistance of ferroportin to hepcidin binding causes exocrine pancreatic failure and fatal iron overload</Artikel><Journal>Cell Metabolism</Journal><ABSTr>The regulatory axis between the iron hormone hepcidin and its receptor, the iron exporter ferroportin (FPN), is central to iron homeostasis. Mutations preventing hepcidin-mediated degradation of FPN cause systemic iron overload. We have introduced a point mutation (C326S) into the murine Fpn locus, resembling human hereditary hemochromatosis type 4, including elevated plasma iron and ferritin levels, high transferrin saturation, hepatic iron overload, and iron depletion of duodenal enterocytes and reticuloendothelial macrophages. Unlike other mouse models of iron overload, homozygous C326S mice die between 7 and 14 months of age. Pancreatic acinar cells display marked iron accumulation, oxidative damage and degeneration, associated with failure of the exocrine pancreas and severe body weight loss. Rescue experiments reveal iron overload and exocrine pancreatic failure as leading causes of death. This work uncovers the critical importance of the hepcidin-ferroportin regulatory axis for life and unveils the sensitivity of the exocrine pancreas to iron overload.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>20 (2), 359-367</Feld596><PubVol>20</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>359</StrtPage><EndPage>367</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Altamura S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Kessler R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Groene HJ" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Gretz N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Hentze MW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Galy B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Muckenthaler MU" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25100063</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.cmet.2014.07.007</DOI><KST>G130</KST><KEYWORD>EXPORTER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REVEALS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METABOLISM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HOMEOSTASIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEREDITARY HEMOCHROMATOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DEFICIENCY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ABSORPTION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52967</publishedID><Artikel>Specificity, propagation, and memory of pericentric heterochromatin</Artikel><Journal>Molecular Systems Biology</Journal><ABSTr>The cell establishes heritable patterns of active and silenced chromatin via interacting factors that set, remove, and read epigenetic marks. To understand how the underlying networks operate, we have dissected transcriptional silencing in pericentric heterochromatin (PCH) of mouse fibroblasts. We assembled a quantitative map for the abundance and interactions of 16 factors related to PCH in living cells and found that stably bound complexes of the histone methyltransferase SUV39H1/2 demarcate the PCH state. From the experimental data, we developed a predictive mathematical model that explains how chromatin-bound SUV39H1/2 complexes act as nucleation sites and propagate a spatially confined PCH domain with elevated histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation levels via chromatin dynamics. This "nucleation and looping" mechanism is particularly robust toward transient perturbations and stably maintains the PCH state. These features make it an attractive model for establishing functional epigenetic domains throughout the genome based on the localized immobilization of chromatin-modifying enzymes.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>10 (), 746-</Feld596><PubVol>10</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>746</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Mueller-Ott K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Erdel F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Matveeva A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Mallm JP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Rademacher A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hahn M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Bauer C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Zhang Q" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Kaltofen S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Schotta G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Hoefer T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Rippe K" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25134515</PMID><KST>B066</KST><KST>B086</KST><KEYWORD>EMBRYONIC STEM-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LYSINE-9 METHYLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HP1 PROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA-METHYLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HISTONE H3</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIVING CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MAMMALIAN-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHROMATIN-REMODELING COMPLEXES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NUCLEOSOME MODIFICATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>52971</publishedID><Artikel>BAY 87-2243, a novel inhibitor of hypoxia-induced gene activation, improves local tumor control after fractionated irradiation in a schedule-dependent manner in head and neck human xenografts</Artikel><Journal>Radiation Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: The transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) pathway plays an important role in tumor response to cytotoxic treatments. We investigated the effects of a novel small molecule inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I and hypoxia-induced HIF-1 activity BAY-87-2243, on tumor microenvironment and response of human squamous cell carcinoma (hSCC) to clinically relevant fractionated radiotherapy (RT) with and without concomitant chemotherapy. METHODS: When UT-SCC-5 hSCC xenografts in nude mice reached 6 mm in diameter BAY-87-2243 or carrier was administered before and/or during RT or radiochemotherapy with concomitant cisplatin (RCT). Local tumor control was evaluated 150 days after irradiation and the doses to control 50% of tumors (TCD50) were compared between treatment arms. Tumors were excised at different time points during BAY-87-2243 or carrier treatment for western blot and immunohistological investigations. RESULTS: BAY-87-2243 markedly decreased nuclear HIF-1alpha expression and pimonidazole hypoxic fraction already after 3 days of drug treatment. BAY-87-2243 prior to RT significantly reduced TCD50 from 123 to 100 Gy (p=0.037). Additional BAY-87-2243 application during RT did not decrease TCD50. BAY-87-2243 before and during radiochemotherapy did not improve local tumor control. CONCLUSIONS: Pronounced reduction of tumor hypoxia by application of BAY-87-2243 prior to RT improved local tumor control. The results demonstrate that radiosensitizing effect importantly depends on treatment schedule. The data support further investigations of HIF-1 pathway inhibitors for radiotherapy and of predictive tests to select patients who will benefit from this combined treatment.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (), 207-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>207</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Helbig L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Koi L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bruechner K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Gurtner K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Hess-Stumpp H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Unterschemmann K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Baumann M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Zips D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Yaromina A" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25234922</PMID><DOI>10.1186/1748-717X-9-207</DOI><KST>L301</KST><KST>L801</KST><KEYWORD>Fractionated radiation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HIF pathway inhibition</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INDUCIBLE FACTOR-1-ALPHA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SQUAMOUS-CELL CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CISPLATIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RADIATION-THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>chemotherapy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHWAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LUNG-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLUCOSE-METABOLISM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>UNFAVORABLE PROGNOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN TUMOR XENOGRAFT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HIF-1-ALPHA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Local tumor control</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HIF-1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>tumor microenvironment</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53000</publishedID><Artikel>Independent calculation of dose distributions for helical tomotherapy using a conventional treatment planning system</Artikel><Journal>Medical Physics</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>48 (8), Art.

It was found that absorbed dose to water values as determined by fluence measurements using FNTDs are, in case of protons, in good agreement (2.4 %) with ionisation chamber measurements, if slower protons and Helium secondaries were accounted for by an effective stopping power. For carbon, however, a significant discrepancy of 4.5 % was seen, which could not be explained by fragmentation, uncertainties or experimental design. The results rather suggest aW-value of 32.10 eV +/- 2.6 %.

In order to target EGFR in head and neck cancer, we have generated a ribonuclease (RNase) fusion protein comprising a humanized anti-EGFR antibody single-chain Fv fragment (scFv) and Ranpirnase, an RNase from Rana pipiens. Fusion of Ranpirnase to the N-terminus of the scFv via a flexible glycine-serine linker (G4S)3 resulted in very poor cytotoxicity of the fusion protein. As endosomal accumulation and lysosomal degradation have been reported to diminish the antitumor efficacy of ribonuclease or toxin-based immunoagents, we explored a fusion peptide from dengue virus that has been reported to be involved in the endosomal escape of the virus. This peptide was introduced as a linker between Ranpirnase and the scFv moiety. The modified immunoRNase exhibited exceptionally high cytotoxicity toward EGFR-expressing head and neck cell lines without affecting specificity. These results indicate that endosomal entrapment needs to be considered for Ranpirnase-based immunoagents and might be overcome by the use of tailored transduction domains from viral proteins.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>27 (10), 331-338</Feld596><PubVol>27</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>331</StrtPage><EndPage>338</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kiesgen S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Liebers N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Cremer M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Arnold U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Weber T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Keller A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Herold-Mende C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Dyckhoff G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Jaeger D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Kontermann RE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Arndt MA" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Krauss J" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25301960</PMID><DOI>10.1093/protein/gzu040</DOI><KST>V964</KST><KST>D120</KST></row><row><publishedID>53012</publishedID><Artikel>The NPM1 Mutation Type Has No Impact on Survival in Cytogenetically Normal AML</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>NPM1 mutations represent frequent genetic alterations in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) associated with a favorable prognosis.

In the adult Drosophila midgut, the Snail homolog Esg is expressed in intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and their transient undifferentiated daughters, termed enteroblasts (EB). We demonstrate here that loss of esg in these progenitor cells causes their rapid differentiation into enterocytes (EC) or entero-endocrine cells (EE). Conversely, forced expression of Esg in intestinal progenitor cells blocks differentiation, locking ISCs in a stem cell state. Cell type-specific transcriptome analysis combined with Dam-ID binding studies identified Esg as a major repressor of differentiation genes in stem and progenitor cells. One critical target of Esg was found to be the POU-domain transcription factor, Pdm1, which is normally expressed specifically in differentiated ECs. Ectopic expression of Pdm1 in progenitor cells was sufficient to drive their differentiation into ECs. Hence, Esg is a critical stem cell determinant that maintains stemness by repressing differentiation-promoting factors, such as Pdm1.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>33 (24), 2967-2982</Feld596><PubVol>33</PubVol><PubIss>24</PubIss><StrtPage>2967</StrtPage><EndPage>2982</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Korzelius J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Naumann SK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Loza-Coll MA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Chan JS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Dutta D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Oberheim J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Glaesser C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Southall TD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Brand AH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Jones DL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Edgar BA" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25298397</PMID><KST>A220</KST><KEYWORD>MIDGUT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>regeneration</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SELF-RENEWAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPITHELIAL-MESENCHYMAL TRANSITIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR SNAIL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REPRESSOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>proliferation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NOTCH ACTIVITY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53015</publishedID><Artikel>HSP90 supports tumor growth and angiogenesis through PRKD2 protein stabilization</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Research</Journal><ABSTr>The kinase PRKD2 is a crucial regulator of tumor cell-endothelial cell communication in gastrointestinal tumors and glioblastomas, but its mechanistic contributions to malignant development are not understood. Here we report that the oncogenic chaperone HSP90 binds to and stabilizes PRKD2 in human cancer cells. Pharmacologic inhibition of HSP90 with structurally divergent small molecules currently in clinical development triggered proteasome-dependent degradation of PRKD2, augmenting apoptosis in human cancer cells of various tissue origins. Conversely, ectopic expression of PRKD2 protected cancer cells from the apoptotic effects of HSP90 abrogation, restoring blood vessel formation in two preclinical models of solid tumors. Mechanistic studies revealed that PRKD2 is essential for hypoxia-induced accumulation of HIF-1alpha and activation of NF-kappaB in tumor cells. Notably, ectopic expression PRKD2 was able to partially restore HIF-1alpha and secreted VEGF-A levels in hypoxic cancer cells treated with HSP90 inhibitors. Taken together, our findings indicate that signals from hypoxia and HSP90 pathways are interconnected and funneled by PRKD2 into the NF-kappaB/ VEGF-A signaling axis to promote tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>74 (23), 7125-7136</Feld596><PubVol>74</PubVol><PubIss>23</PubIss><StrtPage>7125</StrtPage><EndPage>7136</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Azoitei N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Diepold K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Brunner C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Rouhi A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Genze F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Becher A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Kestler H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="van Lint J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Chiosis G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Koren J 3rd" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Froehling S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Scholl C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Seufferlein T" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25297628</PMID><DOI>10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-1017</DOI><KST>G100</KST><KEYWORD>KINASE-D</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CDC37</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>D2</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NF-KAPPA-B</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHAPERONE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>hypoxia-inducible factor-1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INHIBITORS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53016</publishedID><Artikel>Preclinical efficacy of sepantronium bromide (YM155) in multiple myeloma is conferred by down regulation of Mcl-1</Artikel><Journal>Oncotarget</Journal><ABSTr>The inhibitor-of-apoptosis family member survivin has been reported to inhibit apoptosis and regulate mitosis and cytokinesis. In multiple myeloma, survivin has been described to be involved in downstream sequelae of various therapeutic agents. We assessed 1093 samples from previously untreated patients, including two independent cohorts of 392 and 701 patients, respectively. Survivin expression was associated with cell proliferation, adverse prognostic markers, and inferior event-free and overall survival, supporting the evaluation of survivin as a therapeutic target in myeloma. The small molecule suppressant of survivin - YM155 - is in clinical development for the treatment of solid tumors. YM155 potently inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in primary myeloma cells and cell lines. Gene expression and protein profiling revealed the critical roles of IL6/STAT3-signaling and the unfolded protein response in the efficacy of YM155. Both pathways converged to down regulate anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 in myeloma cells. Conversely, growth inhibition and apoptotic cell death by YM155 was rescued by ectopic expression of Mcl-1 but not survivin, identifying Mcl-1 as the pivotal downstream target of YM155 in multiple myeloma. Mcl-1 expression was likewise associated with adverse prognostic markers, and inferior survival. Our results strongly support the clinical evaluation of YM155 in patients with multiple myeloma.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>5 (21), 10237-10250</Feld596><PubVol>5</PubVol><PubIss>21</PubIss><StrtPage>10237</StrtPage><EndPage>10250</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Wagner V" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Hose D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Seckinger A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Weiz L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Meissner T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Reme T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Breitkreutz I" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Podar K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Ho AD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Goldschmidt H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Kraemer A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Klein B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Raab MS" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25296978</PMID><KST>G330</KST><KST>G170</KST><KST>D120</KST><KEYWORD>PHASE-II</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION PROFILES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MALIGNANT PLASMA-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>risk-adapted treatment</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BCL-2 FAMILY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGNOSTIC-FACTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>APOPTOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INHIBITION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURVIVIN EXPRESSION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53017</publishedID><Artikel>Mutational profiles in triple-negative breast cancer defined by ultradeep multigene sequencing show high rates of PI3K pathway alterations and clinically relevant entity subgroup specific differences</Artikel><Journal>Oncotarget</Journal><ABSTr>Mutational profiling of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) by whole exome sequencing (WES) yielded a landscape of genomic alterations in this tumor entity. However, the clinical significance of these findings remains enigmatic. Further, integration of WES in routine diagnostics using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) material is currently not feasible. Therefore, we designed and validated a breast cancer specific gene panel for semiconductor-based sequencing comprising 137 amplicons covering mutational hotspots in 44 genes and applied this panel on a cohort of 104 well-characterized FFPE TNBC with complete clinical follow-up. TP53 mutations were present in more than 80% of cases. PI3K pathway alterations (29.8%) comprising mainly PIK3CA mutations (22.1%) but also mutations and/or amplifications/deletions in other PI3K-associated genes (7.7%) were far more frequently observed, when compared to WES data. Alterations in MAPK signaling genes (8.7%) and cell-cycle regulators (14.4%) were also frequent. Mutational profiles were linked to TNBC subgroups defined by morphology and immunohistochemistry. Alterations in cell-cycle pathway regulators were linked with better overall (p=0.053) but not disease free survival. Taken together, we could demonstrate that breast cancer targeted hotspot sequencing is feasible in a routine setting and yields reliable and clinically meaningful results.

Signatures, composed of features such as mRNAs, miRNAs, SNPs or other molecular variables, are often non-overlapping, even though they have been identified from similar experiments considering samples with the same type of disease. The lack of a consensus is mostly due to the fact that sample sizes are far smaller than the numbers of candidate features to be considered, and therefore signature selection suffers from large variation. We propose a robust signature selection method that enhances the selection stability of penalized regression algorithms for predicting survival risk. Our method is based on an aggregation of multiple, possibly unstable, signatures obtained with the preconditioned lasso algorithm applied to random (internal) subsamples of a given cohort data, where the aggregated signature is shrunken by a simple thresholding strategy. The resulting method, RS-PL, is conceptually simple and easy to apply, relying on parameters automatically tuned by cross validation. Robust signature selection using RS-PL operates within an (external) subsampling framework to estimate the selection probabilities of features in multiple trials of RS-PL. These probabilities are used for identifying reliable features to be included in a signature. Our method was evaluated on microarray data sets from neuroblastoma, lung adenocarcinoma, and breast cancer patients, extracting robust and relevant signatures for predicting survival risk. Signatures obtained by our method achieved high prediction performance and robustness, consistently over the three data sets. Genes with high selection probability in our robust signatures have been reported as cancer-relevant. The ordering of predictor coefficients associated with signatures was well-preserved across multiple trials of RS-PL, demonstrating the capability of our method for identifying a transferable consensus signature.

Here, we investigated the therapeutic potential of the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in 37 meningiomas. Freshly isolated primary meningioma cells were treated with TRAIL with or without different sensitizing protocols, and apoptotic cell death was then quantified. Mechanisms of TRAIL sensitization were determined by a combination of Western blotting, flow cytometry, receptor complex immunoprecipitation, and siRNA-mediated knockdown experiments. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor expression was analyzed using immunohistochemistry and quantified by an automated software-based algorithm. Primary tumor cells from 11 (29.7%) tumor samples were sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, 12 (32.4%) were intermediate TRAIL resistant, and 14 (37.8%) were completely TRAIL resistant. We tested synergistic apoptosis-inducing cotreatment strategies and determined that only the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib potently enhanced expression of the TRAIL receptors TRAIL-R1 and/or TRAIL-R2, the formation of the TRAIL death-inducing signaling complex, and activation of caspases; this treatment resulted in sensitization of all TRAIL-resistant meningioma samples to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Bortezomib pretreatment induced NOXA expression and downregulated c-FLIP, neither of which caused the TRAIL-sensitizing effect. Native TRAIL receptor expression could not predict primary TRAIL sensitivity. This first report on TRAIL sensitivity of primary meningioma cells demonstrates that TRAIL/bortezomib cotreatment may represent a novel therapeutic option for meningiomas.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>73 (11), 1034-1046</Feld596><PubVol>73</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>1034</StrtPage><EndPage>1046</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Koschny R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Boehm C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Sprick MR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Haas TL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Holland H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Xu LX" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Krupp W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Mueller WC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Bauer M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Koschny T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Keller M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Sinn P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Meixensberger J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Walczak H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="14" name="Ganten TM" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25289891</PMID><DOI>10.1097/NEN.0000000000000129</DOI><KST>D040</KST><KEYWORD>INHIBITION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>resistance</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC DRUGS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MEDIATED APOPTOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MULTIPLE-MYELOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANTICANCER THERAPY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53022</publishedID><Artikel>Leukemogenic ptpn11 allele causes defective erythropoiesis in mice</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2), encoded by PTPN11, regulates signaling networks and cell fate in many tissues. Expression of oncogenic PTPN11 in the hematopoietic compartment causes myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) in humans and mice. However, the stage-specific effect(s) of mutant Ptpn11 on erythroid development have remained unknown. We found that expression of an activated, leukemogenic Ptpn11 allele, Ptpn11D61Y, specifically in the erythroid lineage causes dyserythropoiesis in mice. Ptpn11D61Y progenitors produce excess cKIT+CD71+Ter119- cells and aberrant numbers of cKITl degrees CD71+ erythroblasts. Mutant erythroblasts show elevated activation of ERK, AKT and STAT3 in response to EPO stimulation, and MEK inhibitor treatment blocks Ptpn11D61Y-evoked erythroid hyperproliferation in vitro. Thus, the expression of oncogenic Ptpn11 causes dyserythropoiesis in a cell-autonomous manner in vivo.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (10), e109682-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>e109682</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Usenko T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Chan G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Torlakovic E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Klingmueller U" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Neel BG" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25289670</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0109682</DOI><KST>A150</KST><KEYWORD>SIGNALS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PTPN11</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SHP2</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53023</publishedID><Artikel>Mapping of transcription factor motifs in active chromatin identifies IRF5 as key regulator in classical Hodgkin lymphoma</Artikel><Journal>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</Journal><ABSTr>Deregulated transcription factor (TF) activities are commonly observed in hematopoietic malignancies. Understanding tumorigenesis therefore requires determining the function and hierarchical role of individual TFs. To identify TFs central to lymphomagenesis, we identified lymphoma type-specific accessible chromatin by global mapping of DNaseI hypersensitive sites and analyzed enriched TF-binding motifs in these regions. Applying this unbiased approach to classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), a common B-cell-derived lymphoma with a complex pattern of deregulated TFs, we discovered interferon regulatory factor (IRF) sites among the top enriched motifs. High-level expression of the proinflammatory TF IRF5 was specific to HL cells and crucial for their survival. Furthermore, IRF5 initiated a regulatory cascade in human non-Hodgkin B-cell lines and primary murine B cells by inducing the TF AP-1 and cooperating with NF-kappaB to activate essential characteristic features of HL. Our strategy efficiently identified a lymphoma type-specific key regulator and uncovered a tumor promoting role of IRF5.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>111 (42), E4513-E4522</Feld596><PubVol>111</PubVol><PubIss>42</PubIss><StrtPage>E4513</StrtPage><EndPage>E4522</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kreher S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Bouhlel MA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Cauchy P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Lamprecht B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Li S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Grau M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Hummel F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Kochert K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Anagnostopoulos I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Johrens K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Hummel M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Hiscott J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Wenzel SS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Lenz P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Schneider M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Kueppers R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="16" name="Scheidereit C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Giefing M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Siebert R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Rajewsky K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Lenz G" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="21" name="Cockerill PN" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Janz M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Doerken B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="24" name="Bonifer C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Mathas S" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25288773</PMID><DOI>10.1073/pnas.1406985111</DOI><KST>L201</KST><KST>L401</KST><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SYSTEM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NF-KAPPA-B</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INDUCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>T-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STERNBERG CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-REGULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FACTOR-BINDING</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53030</publishedID><Artikel>Early Pregnancy Sex Steroids and Maternal Breast Cancer: A nested case-control study</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Research</Journal><ABSTr>Pregnancy, parity and circulating steroid hormone levels are associated with risk of breast cancer, but little is known about hormone concentrations during pregnancy and subsequent breast cancer risk. We evaluated early pregnancy (&lt;140 days gestation) serum estradiol, estrone, progesterone, and testosterone and breast cancer risk in a nested case-control study in the Finnish Maternity Cohort. The cohort includes 98% of pregnancies registered in Finland since 1983. Individuals with samples collected in the first pregnancy leading to a live birth were eligible. Breast cancer cases (n=1,199) were identified through linkage with the Finnish Cancer Registry; 2,281 matched controls were selected using incidence density sampling. Odds ratios were calculated using conditional logistic regression. Hormone concentrations were not associated with breast cancer overall. Estradiol was positively associated with risk of breast cancer diagnosed age &lt;40 (4th vs. 1st quartile OR 1.60 (1.07-2.39); ptrend=0.01), and inversely associated with breast cancer diagnosed at age &gt;/=40 (4th vs. 1st quartile OR 0.71 (0.51-1.00); ptrend=0.02). Elevated concentrations of the steroid hormones were associated with increased risk of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) negative tumors in women age &lt;40 at diagnosis. We observed no association between steroid hormones and ER+/PR+ disease. These data suggest a positive association between high concentrations of early pregnancy steroid hormones and risk of ER-/PR- breast cancer in women diagnosed age &lt;40, and an inverse association for overall breast cancer diagnosed age &gt;/=40. Further research on pregnancy hormones and risk of steroid receptor negative cancers is needed to further characterize this association.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>74 (23), 6958-6967</Feld596><PubVol>74</PubVol><PubIss>23</PubIss><StrtPage>6958</StrtPage><EndPage>6967</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Fortner RT" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Schock H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kaaks R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Lehtinen M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Pukkala E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Lakso HA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Tanner MM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Kallio R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Joensuu H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Grankvist K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Zeleniuch-Jacquotte A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Toniolo P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Lundin E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Surcel HM" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25281720</PMID><DOI>10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-2150</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>ESTROGEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NURSES HEALTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLLABORATIVE REANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK-FACTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WOMEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECEPTOR-BETA EXPRESSION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53031</publishedID><Artikel>Frequency of therapy-relevant staging shifts in colorectal cancer through the introduction of pN1c in the 7th TNM edition</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: pN1c is a novel N-category introduced for colorectal cancer (CRC) in current TNM (Tumour, Node, Metastasis) classification. It represents cancers displaying tumour deposits (TDs) in the fat but no involvement of lymph nodes. pN1c is integrated into the UICC (International Union Against Cancer) staging system and shifts previous stage II cancers (6th edition) to stage III. We investigated the frequency of upstaging and TD prognostic significance. METHODS: 414 CRCs, consecutively collected during a population-based epidemiological study, TNM classified and UICC staged according to the 6th TNM edition were reinvestigated for TD presence. The association with survival was investigated after a median follow-up time of 5years in multivariate analyses among nodal negative and positive cases. RESULTS: TDs were found in 103 (24.9%) cancers and were strongly associated with T-, N- and M-stages (p&lt;0.0001, each). Upstaging of previous stage II cancers by the presence of TDs (pN1c) was found in six of 140 cases (4.3% of stage II, 1.4% of all tumours). For stage III CRC, strongly reduced overall, CRC-specific and recurrence-free survival were observed with the presence of TDs (hazard ratios (HR) 2.29, 95% confidence interval 1.27-4.10, HR 2.51, 1.27-4.98, and HR 2.43, 1.32-4.48, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Upstaging of CRCs through the introduction of pN1c occurs in less than 5% of previous stage II and less than 2% of all cancers. Given the biologic relevance of TDs, integration into the UICC staging relevant N-category is justified. The high prognostic impact of TDs, however, is not reflected in nodal positive cancers in both the TNM and UICC staging systems.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>50 (17), 2958-2965</Feld596><PubVol>50</PubVol><PubIss>17</PubIss><StrtPage>2958</StrtPage><EndPage>2965</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="von Winterfeld M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Hoffmeister M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Ingold-Heppner B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Jansen L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Tao S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Herpel E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Schirmacher P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Dietel M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Chang-Claude J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Autschbach F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Blaeker H" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25281526</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.ejca.2014.09.002</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>PERICOLONIC TUMOR DEPOSITS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OPTIMAL CATEGORIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>metastases</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADENOCARCINOMAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMPACT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SYSTEM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CLASSIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>rectum</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SPREAD</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53032</publishedID><Artikel>Epidemiological differences in haematological malignancies between Europe and China</Artikel><Journal>Lancet Oncology</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>15 (11), e471-e472</Feld596><PubVol>15</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>e471</StrtPage><EndPage>e472</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Chen XC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Chen XZ" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25281463</PMID><DOI>10.1016/S1470-2045(14)70441-3</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53034</publishedID><Artikel>Genome-wide Association Study Identifies Five Susceptibility Loci for Follicular Lymphoma outside the HLA Region</Artikel><Journal>American Journal of Human Genetics</Journal><ABSTr>Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of follicular lymphoma (FL) have previously identified human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene variants. To identify additional FL susceptibility loci, we conducted a large-scale two-stage GWAS in 4,523 case subjects and 13,344 control subjects of European ancestry. Five non-HLA loci were associated with FL risk: 11q23.3 (rs4938573, p = 5.79 x 10(-20)) near CXCR5; 11q24.3 (rs4937362, p = 6.76 x 10(-11)) near ETS1; 3q28 (rs6444305, p = 1.10 x 10(-10)) in LPP; 18q21.33 (rs17749561, p = 8.28 x 10(-10)) near BCL2; and 8q24.21 (rs13254990, p = 1.06 x 10(-8)) near PVT1. In an analysis of the HLA region, we identified four linked HLA-DRbeta1 multiallelic amino acids at positions 11, 13, 28, and 30 that were associated with FL risk (pomnibus = 4.20 x 10(-67) to 2.67 x 10(-70)). Additional independent signals included rs17203612 in HLA class II (odds ratio [ORper-allele] = 1.44; p = 4.59 x 10(-16)) and rs3130437 in HLA class I (ORper-allele = 1.23; p = 8.23 x 10(-9)). Our findings further expand the number of loci associated with FL and provide evidence that multiple common variants outside the HLA region make a significant contribution to FL risk.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>95 (4), 462-471</Feld596><PubVol>95</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>462</StrtPage><EndPage>471</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Skibola CF"

Imaging alphavbeta3 Integrin Expression with PET Detect Changes in Angiogenesis During Bevacizumab Therapy?</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Nuclear Medicine</Journal><ABSTr>In recent years, there has been a growing interest in molecular imaging markers of tumor-induced angiogenesis. Several radiolabeled RGD (arginine, glycine, aspartate) peptides have been developed for PET imaging of alphavbeta3 integrins in the tumor vasculature, but there are only limited data on how angiogenesis inhibitors affect the tumor uptake of these peptides. METHODS: Changes in 68Ga-NODAGA-c(RGDfK) peptide uptake were measured using PET during bevacizumab therapy of 2 alphavbeta3-negative squamous cell carcinoma cell lines (A-431 and FaDu) that induce alphavbeta3-positive neovasculature when transplanted into nude mice. Tumor uptake of 68Ga-NODAGA-c(RGDfK) was correlated to microvascular density, vascular morphology, and permeability as well as alphavbeta3 integrin expression. RESULTS: Bevacizumab significantly inhibited growth of A-431 tumors and caused a significant reduction in microvascular density and alphavbeta3 integrin expression within 7 d after start of therapy. Bevacizumab also caused a normalization of blood vessel morphology and decreased tumor necrosis. However, 68Ga-NODAGA-c(RGDfK) uptake was significantly increased at day 7 of therapy and did not decrease until after 3 wk of treatment. In Fadu xenografts, bevacizumab therapy caused only a minor inhibition of tumor growth and minor changes in 68Ga-NODAGA-c(RGDfK) uptake. CONCLUSION: Uptake of radiolabeled RGD peptides is not necessarily decreased by effective antiangiogenic therapy. Early in the course of therapy a decrease in the expression of alphavbeta3 integrins may not be reflected by a decrease in the uptake of RGD peptides.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>55 (11), 1878-1884</Feld596><PubVol>55</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>1878</StrtPage><EndPage>1884</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Rylova SN" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Barnucz E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Barnucz E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Fani M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Braun F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Werner M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Lassmann S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Maecke HR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Maecke HR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Weber WA" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25278514</PMID><DOI>10.2967/jnumed.114.137570</DOI><KST>L601</KST><KEYWORD>VIEW</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEAD</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NECK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53037</publishedID><Artikel>Diurnal suppression of EGFR signalling by glucocorticoids and implications for tumour progression and treatment</Artikel><Journal>Nature Communications</Journal><ABSTr>Signal transduction by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and nuclear receptors for steroid hormones is essential for body homeostasis, but the cross-talk between these receptor families is poorly understood. We observed that glucocorticoids inhibit signalling downstream of EGFR, an RTK. The underlying mechanism entails suppression of EGFR's positive feedback loops and simultaneous triggering of negative feedback loops that normally restrain EGFR. Our studies in mice reveal that the regulation of EGFR's feedback loops by glucocorticoids translates to circadian control of EGFR signalling: EGFR signals are suppressed by high glucocorticoids during the active phase (night-time in rodents), while EGFR signals are enhanced during the resting phase. Consistent with this pattern, treatment of animals bearing EGFR-driven tumours with a specific kinase inhibitor was more effective if administered during the resting phase of the day, when glucocorticoids are low. These findings support a circadian clock-based paradigm in cancer therapy.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>5 (), Art. Nr.: 5073-</Feld596><PubVol>5</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>Art.

AT/RTs typically affect infants and occur at various sites of the CNS with a particular frequency in the cerebellum. Here, granule neurons and their progenitors represent the most abundant cell type and are known to give rise to a subset of medulloblastoma, a histologically similar embryonal brain tumor. To test how Smarc proteins influence the development of granule neurons and whether this population may serve as cellular origin for AT/RTs, we specifically deleted Smarca4 and Smarcb1 in cerebellar granule cell precursors. Respective mutant mice displayed severe ataxia and motor coordination deficits, but did not develop any tumors. In fact, they suffered from a severely hypoplastic cerebellum due to a significant inhibition of granule neuron precursor proliferation. Molecularly, this was accompanied by an enhanced activity of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling that, by itself, is known to cause a nearly identical phenotype. We further used an hGFAP-cre allele, which deleted Smarcb1 much earlier and in a wider neural precursor population, but we still did not detect any tumor formation in the CNS. In summary, our results emphasize cell-type-dependent roles of Smarc proteins and argue against cerebellar granule cells and other progeny of hGFAP-positive neural precursors as the cellular origin for AT/RTs.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>34 (40), 13486-13491</Feld596><PubVol>34</PubVol><PubIss>40</PubIss><StrtPage>13486</StrtPage><EndPage>13491</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Moreno N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Schmidt C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Ahlfeld J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Poeschl J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Dittmar S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Pfister SM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Kool M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Kerl K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Schueller U" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25274825</PMID><DOI>10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2560-14.2014</DOI><KST>B062</KST><KEYWORD>CHROMATIN REMODELING FACTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HSNF5/INI1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ATYPICAL TERATOID/RHABDOID TUMORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GRANULE NEURON PRECURSORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CATENIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>medulloblastoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONSTITUTIVE ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHWAY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53042</publishedID><Artikel>Quantitative Imaging Mass Spectrometry of Renal Sulfatides: Validation by classical mass spectrometric methods</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Lipid Research</Journal><ABSTr>Owing to its capability of discriminating subtle mass-altering structural differences such as double bonds or elongated acyl chains, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-based imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) has emerged as a powerful technique for analysis of lipid distribution in tissue at moderate spatial resolution of about 50 micrometer. However, it is still unknown if MS1-signals and ion intensity images correlate with the corresponding apparent lipid concentrations. Analyzing renal sulfated glycosphingolipids, sulfatides, we validate for the first time IMS-signal identities using corresponding sulfatide-deficient kidneys. To evaluate the extent of signal quenching effects interfering with lipid quantification, we surgically dissected the three major renal regions (papillae, medulla and cortex) and systematically compared MALDI IMS of renal sulfatides with quantitative analyses of corresponding lipid extracts by on target MALDI TOF-MS and by UPLC-ESI-(QqQ)MS2. Our results demonstrate a generally strong correlation (R2 &gt; 0.9) between the local relative sulfatide signal intensity in MALDI IMS and absolute sulfatide quantities determined by the other two methods. However, high concentrations of sulfatides in papillae and medulla result in up to 4-fold signal suppression. In conclusion, our study suggests that MALDI IMS is useful for semi-quantitative dissection of relative local changes of sulfatides and possibly other lipids in tissue.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>55 (11), 2343-2353</Feld596><PubVol>55</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>2343</StrtPage><EndPage>2353</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Marsching C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Jennemann R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Heilig R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Groene HJ" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Hopf C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Sandhoff R" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25274613</PMID><DOI>10.1194/jlr.M051821</DOI><KST>G130</KST><KST>G131</KST><KEYWORD>TISSUE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RAT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MALDI-MS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TOF-SIMS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HIGH-SPATIAL-RESOLUTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTERNAL STANDARD</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Sample preparation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ELECTROSPRAY-IONIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MATRIX APPLICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIPID ANALYSIS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53044</publishedID><Artikel>Differential impact of allelic ratio and insertion site in FLT3-ITD positive AML with respect to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation</Artikel><Journal>Blood</Journal><ABSTr>The objective was to evaluate the prognostic and predictive impact of allelic ratio and insertion site (IS) of internal tandem duplications (ITD), as well as concurrent gene mutations with regard to postremission therapy in 323 patients with FLT3-ITD positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Increasing FLT3-ITD allelic ratio (p=0.004) and IS in the tyrosine kinase domain 1 (TKD1, p=0.06) were associated with low complete remission (CR) rates. After postremission therapy including intensive chemotherapy (CTX, n=121) or autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT, n=17), an allelic ratio &gt;/=0.51 was associated with an unfavorable relapse-free (RFS, p=0.0008) and overall survival (OS, p=0.004); after allogeneic HSCT (n=93), outcome was significantly improved in patients with a high allelic ratio (RFS, p=0.02; OS, p=0.03), whereas no benefit was seen in patients with low allelic ratio (RFS, p=0.38; OS, p=0.64). Multivariable analyses revealed a high allelic ratio as a predictive factor for the beneficial effect of allogeneic HSCT; ITD IS in TKD1 remained an unfavorable factor, whereas no prognostic impact of concurrent gene mutations was observed.

The evidence, however, is inconsistent and prospective data are sparse. We examined the association between pre-diagnostic total (low: &lt;20; intermediate: 20 to 100; high &gt;100 kU/l) and specific IgE (negative: &lt;0.35; positive &gt;/=0.35 kU/I) concentrations against inhalant antigens and lymphoma risk in a study nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort. 1021 incident cases and matched controls of NHL, multiple myeloma (MM) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) with a mean follow-up time of 7 years were investigated. Multivariate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by conditional logistic regression. Specific IgE was not associated with the risk of MM, B-NHL and B-NHL subtypes. In contrast, total IgE levels were inversely associated with the risk of MM (high level: OR=0.40 [95%CI=0.21-0.79]) and B-NHL (intermediate level: OR=0.68 [95%CI=0.53-0.88]; high level: OR=0.62 [95%CI=0.44-0.86]), largely on the basis of a strong inverse association with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) (intermediate level: OR=0.49 [95%CI=0.30-0.80]; high level: OR=0.13 [95%CI=0.05-0.35]) risk. The inverse relationship for CLL remained significant for those diagnosed 5 years after baseline. The findings of this large prospective study demonstrated significantly lower prediagnostic total IgE levels among CLL and MM cases compared to matched controls. This corresponds to the clinical immunodeficiency state often observed in CLL patients prior to diagnosis. No support for an inverse association between prediagnostic levels of specific IgE and NHL risk was found.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>35 (12), 2716-2722</Feld596><PubVol>35</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>2716</StrtPage><EndPage>2722</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Nieters A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Luczynska A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Becker S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Becker N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Vermeulen R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Aleksandrova K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Lagiou P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Trichopoulos D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Krogh V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Masala G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Panico S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Sacerdote C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Jeurnink SM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Ardanaz E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Chirlaque MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Sanchez MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Sanchez S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Borgquist S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Butt S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Melin B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Spath F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Rinaldi S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Brennan P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Kelly RS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Vineis P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Kaaks R" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25269801</PMID><KST>C020</KST></row><row><publishedID>53074</publishedID><Artikel>Rational Design of CPP-based Drug Delivery Systems: Considerations from Pharmacokinetics</Artikel><Journal>Current Pharmaceutical Biotechnology</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>15 (3), 200-209</Feld596><PubVol>15</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>200</StrtPage><EndPage>209</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Mickan,A."

Various cellular components, including specific proteins, protein aggregates, organelles and intracellular pathogens, are targets for autophagic degradation. Thereby, autophagy controls numerous vital physiological and pathophysiological functions, including cell signaling, differentiation, turnover of cellular components and pathogen defense. Moreover, autophagy enables the cell to recycle cellular components to metabolic substrates, thereby permitting prolonged survival under low nutrient conditions. Due to the multi-faceted roles for autophagy in maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis and responding to diverse stresses, malfunction of autophagy contributes to both chronic and acute pathologies.ResultsWe applied a systems biology approach to improve the understanding of this complex cellular process of autophagy. All autophagy pathway vesicle activities, i.e. creation, movement, fusion and degradation, are highly dynamic, temporally and spatially, and under various forms of regulation. We therefore developed an agent-based model (ABM) to represent individual components of the autophagy pathway, subcellular vesicle dynamics and metabolic feedback with the cellular environment, thereby providing a framework to investigate spatio-temporal aspects of autophagy regulation and dynamic behavior. The rules defining our ABM were derived from literature and from high-resolution images of autophagy markers under basal and activated conditions. Key model parameters were fit with an iterative method using a genetic algorithm and a predefined fitness function. From this approach, we found that accurate prediction of spatio-temporal behavior required increasing model complexity by implementing functional integration of autophagy with the cellular nutrient state. The resulting model is able to reproduce short-term autophagic flux measurements (up to 3 hours) under basal and activated autophagy conditions, and to measure the degree of cell-to-cell variability. Moreover, we experimentally confirmed two model predictions, namely (i) peri-nuclear concentration of autophagosomes and (ii) inhibitory lysosomal feedback on mTOR signaling.ConclusionAgent-based modeling represents a novel approach to investigate autophagy dynamics, function and dysfunction with high biological realism. Our model accurately recapitulates short-term behavior and cell-to-cell variability under basal and activated conditions of autophagy. Further, this approach also allows investigation of long-term behaviors emerging from biologically-relevant alterations to vesicle trafficking and metabolic state.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>12 (1), Art.

To evaluate their association with cervical cancer, antibodies against proteins from HPV16 (L1, E1, E2, E4, E6 and E7) and HPV18/31/33/35/45/52/58 (L1, E6 and E7) were measured in serum of 307 invasive cervical cancer cases and 327 controls from Algeria and India. Antibody response was evaluated using a glutathione S-transferase-based multiplex serology assay and HPV DNA detected from exfoliated cervical cells using a GP5+/6+-mediated PCR assay. Among HPV16 DNA-positive cases, seroprevalence of HPV16 antibodies ranged from 16% for HPV16 E1 to 50% for HPV16 E6 and all were significantly higher than controls. Seroprevalence of E6, E7 and L1 antibodies for HPV18 and for at least one of HPV31/33/35/45/52/58 were also higher in cases positive for DNA of the corresponding type (50% and 30% for E6 of HPV18 and HPV31/33/35/45/52/58 combined, respectively). E6 and E7 antibodies were rarely found in controls, but cross-reactivity was evident among cancer cases positive for DNA of closely phylogenetically-related HPV types. E6 or E7 antibodies against any of the eight HPV types were detected in 66.1% of all cervical cancer cases, as compared to 10.1% of controls. E6, and to a lesser extent E7, antibodies appear to be specific markers of HPV-related malignancy. However, even among cases positive for the same type of HPV DNA, approximately one-third of cervical cancer cases show no detectable immune response to either E6 or E7.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>135 (10), 2453-2461</Feld596><PubVol>135</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>2453</StrtPage><EndPage>2461</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Combes JD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Pawlita M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Waterboer T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Hammouda D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Rajkumar T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Vanhems P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Snijders P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Herrero R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Franceschi S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Clifford G" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24729277</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28888</DOI><KST>F020</KST><KEYWORD>SEROLOGIC RESPONSE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>E7 PROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SERUM ANTIBODIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>case-control study</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MALIGNANCY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CARCINOMA PATIENTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NECK-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>glutathione-S-transferase</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>antibodies</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WOMEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>cervical cancer</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VIRUS-LIKE PARTICLES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>human papillomavirus</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TYPE-16</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>E6</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53171</publishedID><Artikel>Genetic association of gastric cancer with miRNA clusters including the cancer-related genes MIR29, MIR25, MIR93 and MIR106: results from the EPIC-EURGAST study</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional gene regulators involved in a wide range of biological processes including tumorigenesis. Deregulation of miRNA pathways has been associated with cancer but the contribution of their genetic variability to this disorder is poorly known. We analyzed the genetic association of gastric cancer (GC) and its anatomical and histological subtypes, with 133 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tagging 15 isolated miRNAs and 24 miRNA clusters potentially involved in cancer, in 365 GC cases and 1,284 matched controls within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort. Various SNPs were associated with GC under the log-additive model. Furthermore, several of these miRNAs passed the gene-based permutation test when analyzed according to GC subtypes: three tagSNPs of the miR-29a/miR-29b-1 cluster were associated with diffuse subtype (minimum p-value = 1.7 x 10(-4) ; odds ratio, OR = 1.72; 95% confidence interval, CI = 1.30-2.28), two tagSNPs of the miR-25/miR-93/miR-106b cluster were associated with cardia GC (minimum p-value = 5.38 x 10(-3) ; OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.37-0.86) and one tagSNP of the miR-363/miR-92a-2/miR-19b-2/miR-20b/miR-18b/miR-106a cluster was associated with noncardia GC (minimum p-value = 5.40 x 10(-3) ; OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.12-1.78). Some functionally validated target genes of these miRNAs are implicated in cancer-related processes such as methylation (DNMT3A, DNMT3B), cell cycle (E2F1, CDKN1A, CDKN1C), apoptosis (BCL2L11, MCL1), angiogenesis (VEGFA) and progression (PIK3R1, MYCN). Furthermore, we identified genetic interactions between variants tagging these miRNAs and variants in their validated target genes. Deregulation of the expression of these miRNAs in GC also supports our findings, altogether suggesting for the fist time that genetic variation in MIR29, MIR25, MIR93 and MIR106b may have a critical role in genetic susceptibility to GC and could contribute to the molecular mechanisms of gastric carcinogenesis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>135 (9), 2065-2076</Feld596><PubVol>135</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>2065</StrtPage><EndPage>2076</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Espinosa-Parrilla Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Munoz X" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bonet C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Garcia N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Vencesla A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Yiannakouris N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Naccarati A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Sieri S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Panico S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Huerta JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Barricarte A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Menendez V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Sanchez-Cantalejo E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Dorronsoro M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Brennan P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Duarte-Salles T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="B As Bueno-de-Mesquita H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Lund E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Clavel-Chapelon F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Boutron-Ruault MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Racine A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Numans ME" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Canzian F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="25" name="Campa D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="26" name="Sund M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Johansson M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Ohlsson B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Lindkvist B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Palli D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Travis RC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Wareham N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Nesi G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Gonzalez CA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Sala N" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24643999</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28850</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KST>C055</KST><KEYWORD>nutrition</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROSPECTIVE COHORT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>leukemia</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TARGET</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>APOPTOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MODEL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHWAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POLYMORPHISMS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUSCEPTIBILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POSTTRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROFILES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>miRNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MicroRNAs</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>gastric adenocarcinoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>cancer genetic susceptibility</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>miRNA cluster</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>tagSNP</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53172</publishedID><Artikel>Quality of life in Parkinson`s disease patients with motor fluctuations and dyskinesias in five European countries</Artikel><Journal>Parkinsonism and Related Disorders</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Little is known about the relationship between specific subtypes of treatment-associated motor complications and different domains of health-related Quality of Life (QoL) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Larger studies that investigate these aspects within a cross-cultural setting are scarce. OBJECTIVE: To assess QoL and its association with on-off fluctuations, peak-dose dyskinesias, biphasic dyskinesias, and off-dystonias in PD patients from five European countries. METHODS: Data from 817 PD patients were collected cross-sectionally in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK. QoL was measured with the generic EuroQoL 5-Dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D) and the disease-specific Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39). Multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to test the associations of motor complication subtypes with QoL. RESULTS: Thirty-three percent of the patients (varying from 23% in Italy to 58% in France) suffered from motor complications, either a single subtype or a combination of different subtypes. On-off fluctuations were associated with a 7.1 percentage point decrease in the EQ-5D (p &lt; 0.001) and a 3.6 percentage point deterioration in the PDQ-39 (p = 0.01). Dyskinesias were not seen to affect global QoL scores, but had detrimental effects on the PDQ-39 dimensions activities of daily living, cognitions, stigma, and bodily discomfort. Patients from Spain, Italy, and France had lower global QoL scores in the multivariable analyses than patients from Germany and the UK. CONCLUSION: Motor complications, primarily on-off fluctuations, may impact QoL in PD patients. This substantiates the importance of clinical strategies targeting the prevention, delay of onset, and management of motor complications in PD patients.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>20 (9), 969-974</Feld596><PubVol>20</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>969</StrtPage><EndPage>974</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hechtner MC" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Vogt T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Zollner Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schroeder S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Sauer JB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Binder H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Singer S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Mikolajczyk R" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24953743</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.parkreldis.2014.06.0</DOI><KST>L501</KST><KEYWORD>LEVODOPA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Motor complications</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Motor fluctuations</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PDQ-39</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DYSKINESIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Parkinson's disease</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>quality of life</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EUROPEAN COUNTRIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMPACT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EUROPE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMPLICATIONS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53173</publishedID><Artikel>Risk of cancer in patients with medically diagnosed hay fever or allergic rhinitis</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Data on allergic conditions as risk or protective factors for cancer are controversial probably because most studies have used self-reported data on mixed groups of allergies in a case-control setting. We define cancer risks in medically diagnosed hay fever/allergic rhinitis patients in a nationwide cohort study. A total of 138,723 hay fever/allergic rhinitis patients were identified from three Swedish health care databases and standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for subsequent cancers identified from the Swedish Cancer Registry. Overall cancer risk was not changed (SIR 1.03). For individual cancers, the highest SIR was observed for nasal cancer (SIR 2.63), followed by testicular (1.46) and endocrine tumors (1.42), and kidney (1.31), prostate (1.18) and breast (1.11) cancers. The results were consistent in the three sources of data and all SIRs were above unity, albeit mainly not statistically significant. The SIRs for nervous system tumors were above unity and of borderline significance. SIRs were decreased for esophageal (0.50), liver (0.62) and lung (0.78) cancers, and the three sources of data agreed in the direction of the effect. The increased risks for testicular, renal, prostate and endocrine cancers may be explained by immunological mechanisms. Excess risk for these cancer accounts for a significant population attributable fraction. Nervous system cancers showed a borderline increase and none of the histological types were significantly decreased, providing strong evidence against the published case-control studies, which have reported protective effects. The reasons for the reduced risks for esophageal, liver and lung cancer remain to be explained.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>135 (10), 2397-2403</Feld596><PubVol>135</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>2397</StrtPage><EndPage>2403</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hemminki K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Foersti A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Fallah M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Sundquist J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Sundquist K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Ji J" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24692097</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28873</DOI><KST>C050</KST><KEYWORD>PREVALENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SWEDEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>cancer risk</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HISTOLOGY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>allergic rhinitis</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SYMPTOMS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METAANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>asthma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AUTOIMMUNE-DISEASES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>hay fever</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MALIGNANCY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>standardized incidence ratio</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>immune disturbance</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53174</publishedID><Artikel>Risk factors for cancers of unknown primary site: Results from the prospective EPIC cohort</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Cancer of unknown primary site (CUP) may be called an "orphan" disease, as it is diagnosed when metastases are detected while the primary tumor typically remains undetected, and because little research has been done on its primary causes. So far, few epidemiological studies, if any, have addressed possible risk factors for CUP. We analyzed data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort (N = 476,940). During prospective follow-up, a total of 651 cases of incident cases of CUP were detected (ICD-O-2 code C809). Proportional hazards models were conducted to examine the associations of lifetime history of smoking habits, alcohol consumption, levels of education and anthropometric indices of adiposity with risk of being diagnosed with CUP. Risk of being diagnosed with CUP was strongly related to smoking, with a relative risk of 3.66 [95% C.I., 2.24-5.97] for current, heavy smokers (26+ cigarettes/day) compared to never smokers (adjusted for alcohol consumption, body mass index, waist circumference and level of education) and a relative risk of 5.12 [3.09-8.47] for cases with CUP who died within 12 months. For alcohol consumption and level of education, weaker associations were observed but attenuated and no longer statistically significant after adjusting for smoking and indices of obesity. Finally, risk of CUP was increased by approximately 30 per cent for subjects in the highest versus lowest quartiles of waist circumference. Our analyses provide further documentation, in addition to autopsy studies, that a substantial proportion of cancers of unknown primary site may have their origin in smoking-related tumors, in particular.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>135 (10), 2475-2481</Feld596><PubVol>135</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>2475</StrtPage><EndPage>2481</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kaaks R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Sookthai D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Hemminki K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kraemer A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Wirfalt E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Olsen A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Peeters PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Panico S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Pala V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Vineis P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Quiros JR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Ardanaz E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Sanchez MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Chirlaque MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Larranaga N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Brennan P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Trichopoulos D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Lagiou P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Hallmans G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Key TJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Canzian F" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24692151</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28874</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KST>C050</KST><KST>G330</KST><KST>C055</KST><KEYWORD>cancer of unknown primary site (CUP)</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Prospective cohort study</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CUP</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MODEL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>microarray</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OBESITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>smoking</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IDENTIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALCOHOL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>nutrition</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53175</publishedID><Artikel>Fruit and vegetable intake and cause-specific mortality in the EPIC study</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Epidemiology</Journal><ABSTr>Consumption of fruits and vegetables is associated with a lower overall mortality. The aim of this study was to identify causes of death through which this association is established. More than 450,000 participants from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study were included, of which 25,682 were reported deceased after 13 years of follow-up. Information on lifestyle, diet and vital status was collected through questionnaires and population registries. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) for death from specific causes were calculated from Cox regression models, adjusted for potential confounders. Participants reporting consumption of more than 569 g/day of fruits and vegetables had lower risks of death from diseases of the circulatory (HR for upper fourth 0.85, 95 % CI 0.77-0.93), respiratory (HR for upper fourth 0.73, 95 % CI 0.59-0.91) and digestive system (HR for upper fourth 0.60, 95 % CI 0.46-0.79) when compared with participants consuming less than 249 g/day. In contrast, a positive association with death from diseases of the nervous system was observed. Inverse associations were generally observed for vegetable, but not for fruit consumption. Associations were more pronounced for raw vegetable consumption, when compared with cooked vegetable consumption. Raw vegetable consumption was additionally inversely associated with death from neoplasms and mental and behavioral disorders. The lower risk of death associated with a higher consumption of fruits and vegetables may be derived from inverse associations with diseases of the circulatory, respiratory and digestive system, and may depend on the preparation of vegetables and lifestyle factors.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>29 (9), 639-652</Feld596><PubVol>29</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>639</StrtPage><EndPage>652</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Leenders M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Boshuizen HC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Ferrari P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Siersema PD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Olsen A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Boutron-Ruault MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Dossus L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Dartois L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Kaaks R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Li K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Bergmann MM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Lagiou P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Trichopoulos D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Palli D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Krogh V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Panico S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Vineis P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Peeters PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Engeset D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Braaten T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Redondo ML" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Agudo A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Sanchez MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Amiano P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Huerta JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Ardanaz E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Drake I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Sonestedt E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Johansson I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Winkvist A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Wareham NJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Key TJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Bradbury KE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Johansson M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Licaj I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Gunter MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Murphy N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="44" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="45" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25154553</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s10654-014-9945-9</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>nutrition</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEART-DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROJECT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEALTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MORTALITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POPULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MODEL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>cardiovascular disease</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER-MORTALITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EUROPEAN COUNTRIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>fruits and vegetables</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIETARY-INTAKE MEASUREMENTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE MORTALITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALL-CAUSE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HIROSHIMA/NAGASAKI LIFE-SPAN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Respiratory disease</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53176</publishedID><Artikel>Recurrent RHOA mutations in pediatric Burkitt lymphoma treated according to the NHL-BFM protocols</Artikel><Journal>Genes Chromosomes and Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is the most frequent B-cell lymphoma in childhood. Genetically, it is characterized by the presence of an IG-MYC translocation which is supposed to be an initiating but not sufficient event in Burkitt lymphomagenesis. In a recent whole-genome sequencing study of four cases, we showed that the gene encoding the ras homolog family member A (RHOA) is recurrently mutated in pediatric BL. Here, we analyzed RHOA by Sanger sequencing in a cohort of 101 pediatric B-cell lymphoma patients treated according to Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (NHL-BFM) study protocols. Among the 78 BLs in this series, an additional five had RHOA mutations resulting in a total incidence of 7/82 (8.5%) with c.14G&gt;A (p.R5Q) being present in three cases. Modeling the mutational effect suggests that most of them inactivate the RHOA protein. Thus, deregulation of RHOA by mutation is a recurrent event in Burkitt lymphomagenesis in children.

The majority of astrocytomas harbor concurrent TP53 and ATRX mutations, while most oligodendrogliomas carry the 1p/19q co-deletion. Both entities share high frequencies of IDH mutations. In contrast, oligoastrocytomas (OA) appear less clearly defined and, therefore, there is an ongoing debate whether these tumors indeed constitute an entity or whether they represent a mixed bag containing both astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas. We investigated 43 OA diagnosed in different institutions employing histology, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization addressing surrogates for the molecular genetic markers IDH1R132H, TP53, ATRX and 1p/19q loss. In all but one OA the combination of nuclear p53 accumulation and ATRX loss was mutually exclusive with 1p/19q co-deletion. In 31/43 OA, only alterations typical for oligodendroglioma were observed, while in 11/43 OA, only indicators for mutations typical for astrocytomas were detected. A single case exhibited a distinct pattern, nuclear expression of p53, ATRX loss, IDH1 mutation and partial 1p/19q loss. However, this was the only patient undergoing radiotherapy prior to surgery, possibly contributing to the acquisition of this uncommon combination. In OA with oligodendroglioma typical alterations, the portions corresponding to astrocytic part were determined as reactive, while in OA with astrocytoma typical alterations the portions corresponding to oligodendroglial differentiation were neoplastic. These data provide strong evidence against the existence of an independent OA entity.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>128 (4), 551-559</Feld596><PubVol>128</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>551</StrtPage><EndPage>559</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Sahm F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Reuss D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Koelsche C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Capper D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schittenhelm J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Heim S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Jones DT" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Pfister SM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Herold-Mende C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Wick W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Mueller W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Hartmann C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Paulus W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="von Deimling A" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25143301</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00401-014-1326-7</DOI><KST>G380</KST><KST>G370</KST><KST>B062</KST><KST>L801</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>HYBRIDIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HISTOLOGY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>oligoastrocytoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>19Q</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BRAIN-TUMORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>P53 GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TP53</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>1p</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IDH2 MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ATRX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FREQUENT ATRX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>1p/19q</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IDH1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANAPLASTIC GLIOMAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Mixed glioma</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53178</publishedID><Artikel>Assessing Generalized Anxiety Disorder in Elderly People Using the GAD-7 and GAD-2 Scales: Results of a Validation Study</Artikel><Journal>American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry</Journal><ABSTr>OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the validity of the seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) and its two core items (GAD-2) for detecting GAD in elderly people. METHODS: A criterion-standard study was performed between May and December of 2010 on a general elderly population living at home. A subsample of 438 elderly persons (ages 58-82) of the large population-based German ESTHER study was included in the study. The GAD-7 was administered to participants as part of a home visit. A telephone-administered structured clinical interview was subsequently conducted by a blinded interviewer. The structured clinical (SCID) interview diagnosis of GAD constituted the criterion standard to determine sensitivity and specificity of the GAD-7 and the GAD-2 scales. RESULTS: Twenty-seven participants met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria for current GAD according to the SCID interview (6.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.9%-8.2%). For the GAD-7, a cut point of five or greater appeared to be optimal for detecting GAD. At this cut point the sensitivity of the GAD-7 was 0.63 and the specificity was 0.9. Correspondingly, the optimal cut point for the GAD-2 was two or greater with a sensitivity of 0.67 and a specificity of 0.90. The areas under the curve were 0.88 (95% CI: 0.83-0.93) for the GAD-7 and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.80-0.94) for the GAD-2. The increased scores on both GAD scales were strongly associated with mental health related quality of life (p &lt;0.0001). CONCLUSION: Our results establish the validity of both the GAD-7 and the GAD-2 in elderly persons. Results of this study show that the recommended cut points of the GAD-7 and the GAD-2 for detecting GAD should be lowered for the elderly general population.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>22 (10), 1029-1038</Feld596><PubVol>22</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>1029</StrtPage><EndPage>1038</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Wild B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Eckl A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Herzog W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Niehoff D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Lechner S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Maatouk I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Schellberg D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Mueller H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Loewe B" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>23768681</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.jagp.2013.01.076</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>COOCCURRENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GAD-7 scale</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Generalized anxiety disorder</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PRIMARY-CARE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LATE-LIFE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMORBIDITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>elderly</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>depression</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OLDER-ADULTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>validation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POPULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PREVALENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEALTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AGE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53215</publishedID><Artikel>Cancer beyond organ and tissue specificity: Next-generation-sequencing gene mutation data reveal complex genetic</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Cancer medicine relies on the paradigm that cancer is an organ- and tissue-specific disease, which is the basis for classifying tumors. With the extensive genomic information now available on tumors it is possible to conduct analyses to reveal common genetic features across cancer types and to explore whether the established anatomy-based tumor classification is actually reflected on the genetic level, which might provide important guides to new therapeutic directions. Here, we have conducted an extensive analysis of the genetic similarity of tumors from 14 major cancer entities using somatic mutation data from 4,796 cases available through The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) based on all available genes as well as different cancer-related gene sets. Our analysis provides a systematic account of the genetic similarity network for major cancer types and shows that in about 43% of the cases on average, tumors of a particular anatomic site are genetically more similar to tumors from different organs and tissues (trans-similarity) than to tumors of the same origin (self-similarity). The observed similarities exist not only for carcinomas from different sites but are also present among neoplasms from different tissue origin, such as melanoma, acute myeloid leukemia, and glioblastoma. The current WHO cancer classification is therefore reflected on the genetic level by only about 57% of the tumors. These results provide a rationale to reconsider organ- and tissue-specificity in cancer and contribute to the discussion about whether personalized therapies targeting specific genetic alterations may be transferred to cancers from other anatomic sites with similar genetic properties.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>135 (10), 2362-2369</Feld596><PubVol>135</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>2362</StrtPage><EndPage>2369</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Heim D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Budczies J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Stenzinger A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Treue D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Hufnagl P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Denkert C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Dietel M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Klauschen F."

Tumor heterogeneity and the existence of distinct cell subpopulations exhibiting different genotypes and biological behaviors raise difficulties to eradicate all tumorigenic cells. Recent evidence indicates that a distinct population of tumor cells, called cancer stem cells (CSC), is involved in tumor initiation and recurrence and is a putative cause of tumor radioresistance. There is an urgent need to identify the intrinsic molecular mechanisms regulating the generation and maintenance of resistance to radiotherapy, especially within the CSC subset. The chemokine C-X-C motif receptor 4 (CXCR4) has been found to be a prognostic marker in various types of cancer, being involved in chemotaxis, stemness and drug resistance. The interaction of CXCR4 with its ligand, the chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 12 (CXCL12), plays an important role in modulating the tumor microenvironment, angiogenesis and CSC niche. Moreover, the therapeutic inhibition of the CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling pathway is sensitizing the malignant cells to conventional anti-cancer therapy.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>90 (8), 687-699</Feld596><PubVol>90</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>687</StrtPage><EndPage>699</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Trautmann F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Cojoc M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kurth I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Melin N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Bouchez LC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Dubrovska A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Peitzsch C."

Cryopreservation of preimplantation
embryos or of spermatozoa is a common approach to save those lines. The breeding of a line can be
discontinued if a sufficient number of samples have been cryopreserved. To maintain the opportunity to recover a
line, it is mandatory to assess the quality of the cryopreserved samples and to assure safe long-term storage
conditions. Here, we investigated the revitalization rate of cryopreserved pre-implantation embryos stored inhouse
up to 158 months, of imported (and shipped) embryos, and of embryos received after in vitro fertilization.
The storage period did not affect the revitalization rate, whereas the recovery of imported embryos was significantly
reduced, possibly due to shipment conditions. The genotypes of genetically modified pups received
following embryo-transfer were slightly smaller than expected by Mendelian laws. Intensive investigations of
the hygienic state of the cryopreserved samples and the equipment used never showed microbiological contamination
of a sample within a cryo-tube. However, environmental organisms were found frequently in the
permanent freezers and dry shippers used. Since such contamination cannot be completely excluded and an
embryo-transfer might not lead in all cases to a secure rederivation, foster mothers and revitalized pups should be
housed in an intermediate facility and their health assessed before introducing them into the target facility.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>12 (5), 343-350</Feld596><PubVol>12</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>343</StrtPage><EndPage>350</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ramin, M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Buerger, A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Hoerlein, A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kerkau, D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="von Walcke-Wulffen, V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Nicklas, W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Schenkel, J" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25340944</PMID><DOI>10.1089/bio.2014.0030.</DOI><KST>W430</KST><KST>W440</KST><KEYWORD>MOUSE HEPATITIS-VIRUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIQUID-NITROGEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MICROBIAL-CONTAMINATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SPERM CRYOPRESERVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CROSS-CONTAMINATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GERMPLASM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EMBRYONIC STEM-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VITRO FERTILIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>bacterial</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53298</publishedID><Artikel>Analytical model for macromolecular partitioning during yeast cell division</Artikel><Journal>Bmc Biophysics</Journal><ABSTr>Background: Asymmetric cell division, whereby a parent cell generates two sibling cells with unequal content and thereby distinct fates, is central to cell differentiation, organism development and ageing. Unequal partitioning of the macromolecular content of the parent cell - which includes proteins, DNA, RNA, large proteinaceous assemblies and organelles - can be achieved by both passive (e.g. diffusion, localized retention sites) and active (e.g. motor-driven transport) processes operating in the presence of external polarity cues, internal asymmetries, spontaneous symmetry breaking, or stochastic effects. However, the quantitative contribution of different processes to the partitioning of macromolecular content is difficult to evaluate.

Results: Here we developed an analytical model that allows rapid quantitative assessment of partitioning as a function of various parameters in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This model exposes quantitative degeneracies among the physical parameters that govern macromolecular partitioning, and reveals regions of the solution space where diffusion is sufficient to drive asymmetric partitioning and regions where asymmetric partitioning can only be achieved through additional processes such as motor-driven transport. Application of the model to different macromolecular assemblies suggests that partitioning of protein aggregates and episomes, but not prions, is diffusion-limited in yeast, consistent with previous reports.

Conclusions: In contrast to computationally intensive stochastic simulations of particular scenarios, our analytical model provides an efficient and comprehensive overview of partitioning as a function of global and macromolecule-specific parameters. Identification of quantitative degeneracies among these parameters highlights the importance of their careful measurement for a given macromolecular species in order to understand the dominant processes responsible for its observed partitioning.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>7 (), Art.

The dietary agents sulforaphane and quercetin enriched e.g., in broccoli, and the main and best studied green tea catechin EGCG hold promise as anti-CSC agents in PDA. We examined the efficacy of additional catechins and the combination of these bioactive agents to stem cell features and miRNA signaling. Two established and one primary PDA cell line and non-malignant pancreatic ductal cells were used. Whereas each agent strongly inhibited colony formation, the catechins ECG and CG were more effective than EGCG. A mixture of green tea catechins (GTCs) significantly inhibited viability, migration, expression of MMP-2 and -9, ALDH1 activity, colony and spheroid formation and induced apoptosis, but the combination of GTCs with sulforaphane or quercetin was superior. Following treatment with bioactive agents, the expression of miR-let7-a was specifically induced in cancer cells but not in normal cells and it was associated with K-ras inhibition. These data demonstrate that sulforaphane, quercetin and GTC complement each other in inhibition of PDA progression by induction of miR-let7-a and inhibition of K-ras.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>45 (4), 1391-1400</Feld596><PubVol>45</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>1391</StrtPage><EndPage>1400</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Appari M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Babu KR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kaczorowski A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Gross W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Herr I" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25017900</PMID><DOI>10.3892/ijo.2014.2539</DOI><KST>G403</KST><KEYWORD>EPIGENETIC IMPACT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LET-7</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IDENTIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROSTATE-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>chemoprevention</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STEM-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIETARY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR-INITIATING CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPITHELIAL-MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MicroRNAs</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53309</publishedID><Artikel>miR149 Functions as a Tumor Suppressor by Controlling Breast Epithelial Cell Migration and Invasion</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Research</Journal><ABSTr>Deregulated molecular signaling pathways are responsible for the altered adhesive, migratory, and invasive properties of cancer cells. The different breast cancer subtypes are characterized by the expression of distinct miRNAs, short non-coding RNAs that posttranscriptionally modulate the expression of entire gene networks. Profiling studies have revealed downregulation of miR149 in basal breast cancer. Here, we show that miR149 expression severely impairs cell spreading, migration, and invasion of basal-like breast cancer cells. We identify signaling molecules, including the small GTPases Rap1a and Rap1b, downstream of integrin receptors as miR149 targets, providing an explanation for the defective Src and Rac activation during cell adhesion and spreading upon miR149 expression. Suppression of cell spreading by miR149 could be rescued, at least in part, by expression of constitutively active Rac. Finally, we demonstrate that increased miR149 levels block lung colonization in vivo. On the basis of our findings, we propose that miR149 downregulation in basal breast cancer facilitates the metastatic dissemination of tumor cells by supporting aberrant Rac activation.

A new approach to marker-less guidance involves capturing the intra-operative patient anatomy with a range image device and doing a shape-based registration. However, as the target organ is only partially visible, typically does not provide salient features and underlies severe non-rigid deformations, surface matching in this context is extremely challenging. Furthermore, the intra-operatively acquired surface data may be subject to severe systematic errors and noise. To address these issues, we propose a new approach to establishing surface correspondences, which can be used to initialize fine surface matching algorithms in the context of intra-operative shape-based registration. Our method does not require any prior knowledge on the relative poses of the input surfaces to each other, does not rely on the detection of prominent surface features, is robust to noise and can be used for overlapping surfaces. It takes into account (1) similarity of feature descriptors, (2) compatibility of multiple correspondence pairs, as well as (3) the spatial configuration of the entire correspondence set. We evaluate the algorithm on time-of-flight (ToF) data from porcine livers in a respiratory liver motion simulator. In all our experiments the alignment computed from the established surface correspondences yields a registration error below 1cm and is thus well suited for initializing fine surface matching algorithms for intra-operative soft-tissue registration.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>18 (7), 1101-1114</Feld596><PubVol>18</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>1101</StrtPage><EndPage>1114</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="dos Santos TR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Seitel A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kilgus T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Suwelack S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Wekerle AL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Kenngott H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Speidel S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Schlemmer HP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Meinzer HP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Heimann T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Maier-Hein L" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25038492</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.media.2014.06.002</DOI><KST>E010</KST><KST>E130</KST><KST>E131</KST><KEYWORD>GUIDED LIVER SURGERY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LAPAROSCOPIC PARTIAL NEPHRECTOMY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATIENT REGISTRATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RANGE IMAGES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>segmentation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALGORITHM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECONSTRUCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>navigation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DEFORMATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ABLATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53311</publishedID><Artikel>Loss of keratin k2 expression causes aberrant aggregation of k10, hyperkeratosis, and inflammation</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Investigative Dermatology</Journal><ABSTr>Keratin K2 is one of the most abundant structural proteins of the epidermis; however, its biological significance has remained elusive. Here we show that suprabasal type II keratins, K1 and K2, are expressed in a mutually exclusive manner at different body sites of the mouse, with K2 being confined to the ear, sole, and tail skin. Deletion of K2 caused acanthosis and hyperkeratosis of the ear and the tail epidermis, corneocyte fragility, increased transepidermal water loss, and local inflammation in the ear skin. The loss of K2 was partially compensated by upregulation of K1 expression. However, a significant portion of K2-deficient suprabasal keratinocytes lacked a regular cytoskeleton and developed massive aggregates of the type I keratin, K10. Aggregate formation, but not hyperkeratosis, was suppressed by the deletion of both K2 and K10, whereas deletion of K10 alone caused clumping of K2 in ear skin. Taken together, this study demonstrates that K2 is a necessary and sufficient binding partner of K10 at distinct body sites of the mouse and that unbalanced expression of these keratins results in aggregate formation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>134 (10), 2579-2588</Feld596><PubVol>134</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>2579</StrtPage><EndPage>2588</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Fischer H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Langbein L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Reichelt J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Praetzel-Wunder S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Buchberger M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Ghannadan M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Tschachler E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Eckhart L" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24751727</PMID><DOI>10.1038/jid.2014.197</DOI><KST>A110</KST><KEYWORD>NUCLEAR-DNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTEGRITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPIDERMOLYSIS-BULLOSA SIMPLEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SKIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ICHTHYOSIS BULLOSA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CORNIFIED ENVELOPE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOUSE EPIDERMIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>2E</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SIEMENS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53313</publishedID><Artikel>Long term results after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) in patients with craniopharyngioma: maximal tumor control with minimal side effects</Artikel><Journal>Radiation Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: There are already numerous reports about high local control rates in patients with craniopharyngioma but there are only few studies with follow up times of more than 10 years. This study is an analysis of long term control, tumor response and side effects after fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) for patients with craniopharyngioma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 55 patients who were treated with FSRT for craniopharyngioma were analyzed. Median age was 37 years (range 6-70 years), among them eight children &lt; 18 years. Radiotherapy (RT) was indicated for progressive disease after neurosurgical resection or postoperatively after repeated resection or partial resection. A median dose of 52.2 Gy (50 - 57.6 Gy) was applied with typical dose per fraction of 1.8 Gy five times per week. The regular follow up examinations comprised in addition to contrast enhanced MRI scans thorough physical examinations and clinical evaluation. RESULTS: During median follow up of 128 months (2 - 276 months) local control rate was 95.3% after 5 years, 92.1% after 10 years and 88.1% after 20 years. Overall survival after 10 years was 83.3% and after 20 years 67.8% whereby none of the deaths were directly attributed to craniopharyngioma. Overall treatment was tolerated well with almost no severe acute or chronic side effects. One patient developed complete anosmia, another one's initially impaired vision deteriorated further. In 83.6% of the cases with radiological follow up a regression of irradiated tumor residues was monitored, in 7 cases complete response was achieved. 44 patients presented themselves initially with endocrinologic dysfunction none of them showed signs of further deterioration during follow up. No secondary malignancies were observed. CONCLUSION: Long term results for patients with craniopharyngioma after stereotactic radiotherapy are with respect to low treatment related side effects as well as to local control and overall survival excellent.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (), Art.

TIL therapy itself has little side effects, but conditioning chemo- or radiotherapy and postinfusion interleukin 2 (IL-2) injections are associated with severe adverse advents. We reasoned that combining TIL infusion with dendritic cell (DC) vaccination could circumvent the need for conditioning and IL-2 support and thus represent a milder treatment approach. Eight patients with stage IV melanoma were enrolled in the MAT01 study, consisting of vaccination with autologous tumor-lysate-loaded DC, followed by TIL infusion. Six of eight patients were treated according to protocol, while one patient received only TIL and one only DC. Treatments were well tolerated with a single grade 3 adverse event. The small study size precludes analysis of clinical responses, though interestingly one patient showed a complete remission and two had stable disease. Analysis of the infusion products revealed that mature DC were generated in all cases. TIL after expansion were CD3+ T cells, dominated by effector memory CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. Analysis of the T cell receptor repertoire revealed presence of highly dominant clones in most infusion products, and many of these could be detected in the circulation for weeks after T cell transfer. Here, we report the first combination of DC vaccination and TIL infusion in malignant melanoma. This combined treatment was safe and feasible, though after evaluating both clinical and immunological parameters, we expect that administration of lymphodepleting chemotherapy and IL-2 will likely increase treatment efficacy.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>63 (10), 1061-1071</Feld596><PubVol>63</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>1061</StrtPage><EndPage>1071</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Poschke I" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Lovgren T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Adamson L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Nystrom M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Andersson E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hansson J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Tell R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Masucci GV" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Kiessling R" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24993563</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00262-014-1575-2</DOI><KST>G180</KST><KEYWORD>INTERLEUKIN-2</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CARCINOMA PATIENTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>chemotherapy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METASTATIC MELANOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMMUNOTHERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>tumor</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INCREASED INTENSITY LYMPHODEPLETION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MEDIATE REGRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LYSATE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53315</publishedID><Artikel>Multi-shell diffusion signal recovery from sparse measurements</Artikel><Journal>Medical Image Analysis</Journal><ABSTr>For accurate estimation of the ensemble average diffusion propagator (EAP), traditional multi-shell diffusion imaging (MSDI) approaches require acquisition of diffusion signals for a range of b-values. However, this makes the acquisition time too long for several types of patients, making it difficult to use in a clinical setting. In this work, we propose a new method for the reconstruction of diffusion signals in the entire q-space from highly undersampled sets of MSDI data, thus reducing the scan time significantly. In particular, to sparsely represent the diffusion signal over multiple q-shells, we propose a novel extension to the framework of spherical ridgelets by accurately modeling the monotonically decreasing radial component of the diffusion signal. Further, we enforce the reconstructed signal to have smooth spatial regularity in the brain, by minimizing the total variation (TV) norm. We combine these requirements into a novel cost function and derive an optimal solution using the Alternating Directions Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. We use a physical phantom data set with known fiber crossing angle of 45 degrees to determine the optimal number of measurements (gradient directions and b-values) needed for accurate signal recovery. We compare our technique with a state-of-the-art sparse reconstruction method (i.e., the SHORE method of Cheng et al. (2010)) in terms of angular error in estimating the crossing angle, incorrect number of peaks detected, normalized mean squared error in signal recovery as well as error in estimating the return-to-origin probability (RTOP). Finally, we also demonstrate the behavior of the proposed technique on human in vivo data sets. Based on these experiments, we conclude that using the proposed algorithm, at least 60 measurements (spread over three b-value shells) are needed for proper recovery of MSDI data in the entire q-space.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>18 (7), 1143-1156</Feld596><PubVol>18</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>1143</StrtPage><EndPage>1156</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Rathi Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Michailovich O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Laun F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Setsompop K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Grant PE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Westin CF" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25047866</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.media.2014.06.003</DOI><KST>E020</KST><KEYWORD>MRI</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WHITE-MATTER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECONSTRUCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ARCHITECTURE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISTRIBUTIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>APPROXIMATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>human brain</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MINIMIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WATER DIFFUSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMPUTATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53317</publishedID><Artikel>Riproximin is a recently discovered type II ribosome inactivating protein with potential for treating cancer</Artikel><Journal>Biotechnology Advances</Journal><ABSTr>The development of new anticancer drugs is a salient problem and the traditional use of plants is a potentially rich source of information for detecting new molecules with antineoplastic activity. Riproximin is a recently detected cytotoxic type II ribosome inactivating protein with high selectivity for certain tumor cell lines. Its activity was recognized as the main component in a plant powder used by African healers for treating cancer. By ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase gene sequencing analysis, the powder was identified to be derived from the plant Ximenia americana. The cDNA sequence of riproximin was identified, the protein was modeled to contain one A- and a B-chain, respectively, and a reliable purification procedure from kernels of X. americana was established. Riproximin displays high but differential antiproliferative activity in a panel of human and rodent cancer cell lines, with concentrations inhibiting cell proliferation by 50% (IC50 values) that diverge by a factor of 100. Consistent antineoplastic activity was detected in colorectal and pancreatic cancer liver metastasis models in rats. The cytotoxic mechanism of action was determined to be based on cellular uptake of riproximin followed by its A-chain prompted depurination of the 28S ribosomal RNA and induction of unfolded protein response. Riproximin's specificity depended on its B-chain connected binding to cell surface glycans, the presence of which is crucial for subsequent internalization into cells and cytotoxicity. These N- and O-glycans include bi- and tri-antennary NA structures (NA2/NA3) as well as Tn3 structures (clustered Tn antigen). Riproximin was found to crosslink proteins with N- and O-glycan structure, thus indicating both types of binding sites on its B chain. Due to this crosslinking ability, riproximin is expected to show prominent cytotoxicity towards cells expressing both, NA2/NA3 and clustered Tn structures. Apart from the properties of riproximin, the plant X. americana has been known for some medical uses in traditional African medicine, including various types of infections.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>32 (6), 1077-1090</Feld596><PubVol>32</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>1077</StrtPage><EndPage>1090</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Adwan H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Bayer H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Pervaiz A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Sagini M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Berger MR" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24699434</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.biotechadv.2014.03.0</DOI><KST>G401</KST><KEYWORD>XIMENIA-AMERICANA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PLANTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRADITIONAL MEDICINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RICIN-A-CHAIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RAT-LIVER METASTASIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IDENTIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MECHANISM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TOXICITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>APOPTOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RNA N-GLYCOSIDASE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53318</publishedID><Artikel>Thermogenic adipocytes: From cells to physiology and medicine</Artikel><Journal>Metabolism: clinical and experimental</Journal><ABSTr>The identification of active brown fat in humans has evoked widespread interest in the biology of non-shivering thermogenesis among basic and clinical researchers. As a consequence we have experienced a plethora of contributions related to cellular and molecular processes in thermogenic adipocytes as well as their function in the organismal context and their relevance to human physiology. In this review we focus on the cellular basis of non-shivering thermogenesis, particularly in relation to human health and metabolic disease. We provide an overview of the cellular function and distribution of thermogenic adipocytes in mouse and humans, and how this can be affected by environmental factors, such as prolonged cold exposure. We elaborate on recent evidence and open questions on the distinction of classical brown versus beige/brite adipocytes. Further, the origin of thermogenic adipocytes as well as current models for the recruitment of beige/brite adipocytes is discussed with an emphasis on the role of progenitor cells. Focusing on humans, we describe the expanding evidence for the activity, function and physiological relevance of thermogenic adipocytes. Finally, as the potential of thermogenic adipocyte activation as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of obesity and associated metabolic diseases becomes evident, we highlight goals and challenges for current research on the road to clinical translation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>63 (10), 1238-1249</Feld596><PubVol>63</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>1238</StrtPage><EndPage>1249</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Diaz MB" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Herzig S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Vegiopoulos A" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25107565</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.metabol.2014.07.002</DOI><KST>A170</KST><KST>A171</KST><KEYWORD>DIET-INDUCED THERMOGENESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>UNCOUPLING PROTEIN-1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLD-ACCLIMATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENERGY-EXPENDITURE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADAPTIVE THERMOGENESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WHITE FAT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADULT HUMANS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BROWN ADIPOSE-TISSUE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PPAR-GAMMA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53319</publishedID><Artikel>Evolving therapeutic concepts in prostate cancer based on genome-wide analyses</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>Treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) continues to represent a major urooncological challenge due to tumor heterogeneity and the inevitable development of therapy resistance. Although androgen deprivation therapy retains an important role in the management of CRPC, recent evidence suggests that a broader spectrum of therapeutic targets may improve patient response and delay development of advanced disease. Genome-wide analyses have identified four major signaling nodes that are most frequently altered in prostate cancer: i) the androgen receptor (AR); ii) the PI3K pathway; iii) the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway; and iv) the retinoblastoma protein (pRB) signaling pathway. Extensive crosstalk and redundancy exists between these signaling pathways, which underscores the need for combination therapies. There are several novel AR pathway inhibitors currently in clinical use. Clinical trials are being performed on single-agent PI3K inhibitors with some success in tumors with genetically altered PI3K components. MEK/ERK inhibitors are also in clinical trials and the importance of pRB inactivation in prostate cancer is becoming more widely recognized. A greater understanding of the effects of single agent therapy on compensatory signaling pathway activation that can potentially thwart antitumoral responses is urgently needed and will provide additional insight into the mechanism of therapy resistance and how to further delay the progression to lethal disease.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>45 (4), 1337-1344</Feld596><PubVol>45</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>1337</StrtPage><EndPage>1344</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Georgi B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Korzeniewski N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Hadaschik B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Gruellich C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Roth W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Sueltmann H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Pahernik S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Hohenfellner M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Duensing S" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25070358</PMID><DOI>10.3892/ijo.2014.2567</DOI><KST>G150</KST><KST>B063</KST><KEYWORD>RETINOBLASTOMA PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MITOXANTRONE PLUS PREDNISONE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RAF/MEK/ERK PATHWAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MALIGNANT-TRANSFORMATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SIGNALING PATHWAYS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>gene amplification</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANDROGEN RECEPTOR PHOSPHORYLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PARADOXICAL ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PI3K/AKT/MTOR PATHWAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INCREASED SURVIVAL</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53320</publishedID><Artikel>Proteomics.

Monitoring the effects of small-molecule ligands on the profiles delineated more than 50 targets for the kinase inhibitor staurosporine. We identified the heme biosynthesis enzyme ferrochelatase as a target of kinase inhibitors and suggest that its inhibition causes the phototoxicity observed with vemurafenib and alectinib. Thermal shifts were also observed for downstream effectors of drug treatment. In live cells, dasatinib induced shifts in BCR-ABL pathway proteins, including CRK/CRKL.

Adenosine is considered as one of the main immunosuppressive factors in the tumor environment. It is produced via enzymatic hydrolysis of extracellular ATP by ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73 localized on cell surface. Using the ret transgenic mouse melanoma model that closely mimics human melanoma, we demonstrated an increased frequency of ectonucleotidase-positive myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in melanoma lesions and lymphoid organs. Furthermore, we observed that conventional CD4(+)FoxP3(-) and CD8(+) T cells infiltrating melanoma lesions of ret transgenic mice were distinctly enriched in the CD39(+)CD73(+) subpopulation that co-expressed also PD-1. Ectonucleotidase expression was also up-regulated in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells upon activation. In addition, these ectoenzymes were largely found to be expressed on memory T cell compartment (in particular, on effector memory cells). Our data suggest that extracellular adenosine produced by regulatory T cells (Tregs) and MDSCs can suppress T cell effector functions through paracrine signaling. Another mechanism involves its production also by effector T cells and an inhibition of their anti-tumor reactivity via autocrine signaling as a part of the negative feedback loop. This mode of adenosine signaling could be also used by Tregs and MDSCs to enhance their immunosuppressive activity.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>63 (10), 1073-1080</Feld596><PubVol>63</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>1073</StrtPage><EndPage>1080</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Umansky V" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Shevchenko I" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bazhin AV" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Utikal J" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24756420</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00262-014-1553-8</DOI><KST>G300</KST><KEYWORD>REGULATORY T-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CYTOKINE PRODUCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>chronic inflammation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUPPRESSOR-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE ACTIVITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR-NECROSIS-FACTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DEAMINASE DEFICIENCY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LINKING INFLAMMATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CD11B(+)GR1(+) CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MEDIATED INHIBITION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53382</publishedID><Artikel>Comparative Analysis and Modeling of the Severity of Steatohepatitis in DDC-Treated Mouse Strains</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has a broad spectrum of disease states ranging from mild steatosis characterized by an abnormal retention of lipids within liver cells to steatohepatitis (NASH) showing fat accumulation, inflammation, ballooning and degradation of hepatocytes, and fibrosis. Ultimately, steatohepatitis can result in liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS: In this study we have analyzed three different mouse strains, A/J, C57BL/6J, and PWD/PhJ, that show different degrees of steatohepatitis when administered a 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) containing diet. RNA-Seq gene expression analysis, protein analysis and metabolic profiling were applied to identify differentially expressed genes/proteins and perturbed metabolite levels of mouse liver samples upon DDC-treatment. Pathway analysis revealed alteration of arachidonic acid (AA) and S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) metabolism upon other pathways. To understand metabolic changes of arachidonic acid metabolism in the light of disease expression profiles a kinetic model of this pathway was developed and optimized according to metabolite levels. Subsequently, the model was used to study in silico effects of potential drug targets for steatohepatitis. CONCLUSIONS: We identified AA/eicosanoid metabolism as highly perturbed in DDC-induced mice using a combination of an experimental and in silico approach. Our analysis of the AA/eicosanoid metabolic pathway suggests that 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE), 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) and prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) are perturbed in DDC mice. We further demonstrate that a dynamic model can be used for qualitative prediction of metabolic changes based on transcriptomics data in a disease-related context. Furthermore, SAMe metabolism was identified as being perturbed due to DDC treatment. Several genes as well as some metabolites of this module show differences between A/J and C57BL/6J on the one hand and PWD/PhJ on the other.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (10), e111006-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>e111006</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Pandey V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Sultan M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kashofer K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Ralser M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Amstislavskiy V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Starmann J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Osprian I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Grimm C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Hache H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Yaspo ML" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Sueltmann H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Trauner M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Denk H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Zatloukal K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Lehrach H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Wierling C" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25347188</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0111006</DOI><KST>B063</KST><KEYWORD>METABOLISM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALPHA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACID</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>inactivation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NONALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>5-LIPOXYGENASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>prostaglandins</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53384</publishedID><Artikel>On the origin of giant cells in Hodgkin lymphoma</Artikel><Journal>Communicative and Integrative Biology</Journal><ABSTr>Multinucleated giant tumor cells are frequently observed in tissue sections of lymphoma patients. In Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), these cells are pathognomonic for the disease and named Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells. Despite the well-described disease-promoting functions of RS cells, their development has remained obscure. We addressed this open question by continuous live cell imaging to observe the generation of RS cells. Single-cell tracking of HL cell lines revealed that RS cells develop from mononucleated progenitors that divide and subsequently re-fuse, before they grow and become multinucleated giant cells. Thus, RS cell generation is neither due to cell fusion of unrelated Hodgkin cells nor to endomitosis, as previously suggested. In the majority of cases, re-fusion of daughter cells was preceded by an incomplete cytokinesis, visualized by a persistent microtubule bridge connecting the cells. This surprising finding describes a novel mechanism for the formation of multinuclear giant cells with potential relevance beyond HL.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>7 (), e28602-</Feld596><PubVol>7</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>e28602</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Rengstl B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Rieger MA" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Newrzela S" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25346790</PMID><KST>L501</KST></row><row><publishedID>53385</publishedID><Artikel>Meeting report: The road to science-based policy - ESOF through the eyes of young scientists</Artikel><Journal>BioEssays</Journal><ABSTr>Communication and common understanding between politicians, scientists, and the society can lead to evidence-based science policy, a core principle that guides high caliber research and open innovation for a sustainable future.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>36 (12), 1129-1131</Feld596><PubVol>36</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>1129</StrtPage><EndPage>1131</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Sinjab A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Noeske K" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25346005</PMID><DOI>10.1002/bies.201400169</DOI><KST>A110</KST><KST>A210</KST></row><row><publishedID>53386</publishedID><Artikel>Mutations in PLK4, encoding a master regulator of centriole biogenesis, cause microcephaly, growth failure and retinopathy</Artikel><Journal>Nature Genetics</Journal><ABSTr>Centrioles are essential for ciliogenesis. However, mutations in centriole biogenesis genes have been reported in primary microcephaly and Seckel syndrome, disorders without the hallmark clinical features of ciliopathies. Here we identify mutations in the genes encoding PLK4 kinase, a master regulator of centriole duplication, and its substrate TUBGCP6 in individuals with microcephalic primordial dwarfism and additional congenital anomalies, including retinopathy, thereby extending the human phenotypic spectrum associated with centriole dysfunction. Furthermore, we establish that different levels of impaired PLK4 activity result in growth and cilia phenotypes, providing a mechanism by which microcephaly disorders can occur with or without ciliopathic features.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>46 (12), 1283-1292</Feld596><PubVol>46</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>1283</StrtPage><EndPage>1292</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Martin CA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Ahmad I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Klingseisen A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Hussain MS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Bicknell LS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Leitch A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Nuernberg G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Toliat MR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Murray JE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Hunt D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Khan F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Ali Z" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Tinschert S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Ding J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Keith C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Harley ME" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Heyn P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Muller R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Hoffmann I" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="19" name="Daire VC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Dollfus H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Dupuis L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Bashamboo A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="McElreavey K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Kariminejad A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Mendoza-Londono R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Moore AT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Saggar A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Schlechter C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Weleber R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Thiele H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Altmueller J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Hoehne W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Hurles ME" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Noegel AA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Baig SM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Nuernberg P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Jackson AP" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25344692</PMID><DOI>10.1038/ng.3122</DOI><KST>F045</KST></row><row><publishedID>53387</publishedID><Artikel>The `mitoflash` probe cpYFP does not respond to superoxide</Artikel><Journal>Nature</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>514 (7523), E12-E14</Feld596><PubVol>514</PubVol><PubIss>7523</PubIss><StrtPage>E12</StrtPage><EndPage>E14</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schwarzlaender M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Wagner S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Ermakova YG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Belousov VV" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Radi R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Beckman JS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Buettner GR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Demaurex N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Duchen MR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Forman HJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Fricker MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Gems D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Halestrap AP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Halliwell B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Jakob U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Johnston IG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Jones NS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Logan DC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Morgan B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="19" name="Mueller FL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Nicholls DG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Remington SJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Schumacker PT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Winterbourn CC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Sweetlove LJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Meyer AJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Dick TP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="27" name="Murphy MP" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25341790</PMID><DOI>10.1038/nature13858</DOI><KST>A160</KST><KEYWORD>SIGNALS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FLASHES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MITOCHONDRIAL SUPEROXIDE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53393</publishedID><Artikel>A phase II, randomised, study of weekly APG101 + reirradiation versus reirradiation in progressive glioblastoma</Artikel><Journal>Clinical Cancer Research</Journal><ABSTr>Purpose: Preclinical data indicate antiinvasive activity of APG101, a CD95-ligand (CD95L)-binding fusion protein, in glioblastoma. Experimental Design: Patients (N=91) with glioblastoma at first or second progression were randomised 1:2 between second radiotherapy (rRT) (36 Gy; 5 times 2 Gy per week; rRT) or rRT+APG101 (400 mg weekly i.v.). Patient characteristics [N=84 (26 patients rRT, 58 patients rRT + APG101)] were balanced. Results: PFS-6 rates were 3.8% (95%-CI: 0.1 - 19.6) rRT and 20.7% (95%-CI: 11.2 - 33.4) for rRT+APG101 (p=0.048). Median PFS was 2.5 (95%-CI: 2.3-3.8) months and 4.5 (95%-CI: 3.7-5.4) months with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.49 (95% CI: 0.27-0.88, p=0.0162) adjusted for tumour size. Cox regression analysis adjusted for tumour size revealed a HR 0.60 (95% CI: 0.36-1.01)] (p=0.0559) for rRT+APG101 for death of any cause. Lower methylation levels at CpG2 in the CD95L promoter in the tumour conferred a stronger risk reduction (HR=0.19; 95% CI: 0.06-0.58 for treatment with APG101 suggesting a potential biomarker. Conclusions: CD95 pathway inhibition in combination with rRT is an innovative concept with clinical efficacy. It warrants further clinical development.

Although great strides have been taken in treating PDAC over the past decades its incidence nearly equals its mortality rate and it was quoted as the 4th leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. in 2012. This review aims to focus on research models and scientific developments that help to explain the extraordinary resistance of PDAC towards current therapeutic regimens. Furthermore, it highlights the main features of drug resistance including mechanisms promoted by cancer cells or cancer stem cells (CSCs), as well as stromal cells, and the acellular components surrounding the tumor cells-known as peritumoral desmoplasia-that affects intra-tumoral drug delivery. Finally, therapeutic concepts and avenues for future research are suggested, based on the topics discussed.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>6 (4), 2137-2154</Feld596><PubVol>6</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>2137</StrtPage><EndPage>2154</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schober M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Jesenofsky R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Faissner R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Weidenauer C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Hagmann W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Michl P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Heuchel RL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Haas SL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Loehr JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25337831</PMID><KST>C010</KST></row><row><publishedID>53395</publishedID><Artikel>Smoking and Long-Term Risk of Type 2 Diabetes: The EPIC-InterAct Study in European Populations</Artikel><Journal>Diabetes Care</Journal><ABSTr>OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to investigate the association between smoking and incident type 2 diabetes, accounting for a large number of potential confounding factors, and to explore potential effect modifiers and intermediate factors. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-InterAct is a prospective case-cohort study within eight European countries, including 12,403 cases of incident type 2 diabetes and a random subcohort of 16,835 individuals. After exclusion of individuals with missing data, the analyses included 10,327 cases and 13,863 subcohort individuals. Smoking status was used (never, former, current), with never smokers as the reference. Country-specific Prentice-weighted Cox regression models and random-effects meta-analysis were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: In men, the HRs (95% CI) of type 2 diabetes were 1.40 (1.26, 1.55) for former smokers and 1.43 (1.27, 1.61) for current smokers, independent of age, education, center, physical activity, and alcohol, coffee, and meat consumption. In women, associations were weaker, with HRs (95% CI) of 1.18 (1.07, 1.30) and 1.13 (1.03, 1.25) for former and current smokers, respectively. There was some evidence of effect modification by BMI. The association tended to be slightly stronger in normal weight men compared with those with overall adiposity. CONCLUSIONS: Former and current smoking was associated with a higher risk of incident type 2 diabetes compared with never smoking in men and women, independent of educational level, physical activity, alcohol consumption, and diet. Smoking may be regarded as a modifiable risk factor for type 2 diabetes, and smoking cessation should be encouraged for diabetes prevention.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>37 (12), 3164-3171</Feld596><PubVol>37</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>3164</StrtPage><EndPage>3171</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Spijkerman AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="van der A DL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Nilsson PM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Ardanaz E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Gavrila D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Agudo A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Arriola L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Balkau B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Beulens JW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="de Lauzon-Guillain B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Fagherazzi G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Feskens EJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Franks PW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Grioni S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Huerta JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Kaaks R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="17" name="Key TJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Palli D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Panico S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Redondo ML" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Rolandsson O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Roswall N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Sacerdote C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Sanchez MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Schulze MB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Slimani N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Teucher B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="29" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="van der Schouw YT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Langenberg C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Sharp SJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Forouhi NG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Wareham NJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25336749</PMID><DOI>10.2337/dc14-1020</DOI><KST>C020</KST></row><row><publishedID>53410</publishedID><Artikel>Novel genome-wide association study-based candidate loci for differentiated thyroid cancer risk</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism</Journal><ABSTr>Context: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) have identified robust associations with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 9q22.33 (FOXE1), 14q13.3 (NKX2-1), and 2q35 (DIRC3). Our recently published GWAS suggested additional susceptibility loci specific for the high-incidence Italian population.

Objective: The purpose of this study was to identify novel Italian-specific DTC risk variants based on our GWAS and to test them further in low-incidence populations.

Design: We investigated 45 SNPs selected from our GWAS first in an Italian population. SNPs that showed suggestive evidence of association were investigated in the Polish and Spanish cohorts.

Results: The combined analysis of the GWAS and the Italian replication study (2260 case patients and 2218 control subjects) provided strong evidence of association with rs10136427 near BATF (odds ratio [ OR] = 1.40, P = 4.35 x 10(-7)) and rs7267944 near DHX35 (OR = 1.39, P = 2.13 x 10(-8)). A possible role in DTC susceptibility in the Italian populations was also found for rs13184587 (ARSB) (P = 8.54 x 10(-6)) and rs1220597 (SPATA13) (P = 3.25 x 10(-6)). Only the associations between rs10136427 and rs7267944 and DTC risk were replicated in the Polish and the Spanish populations with little evidence of population heterogeneity (GWAS and all replications combined, OR = 1.30, P = 9.30 x 10(-7) and OR = 1.32, P = 1.34 x 10(-8), respectively). In silico analyses provided new insights into the possible functional consequences of the SNPs that showed the strongest association with DTC.

Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence for novel DTC susceptibility variants. Further studies are warranted to identify the specific genetic variants responsible for the observed associations and to functionally validate our in silico predictions.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>99 (10), E2084-E2092</Feld596><PubVol>99</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>E2084</StrtPage><EndPage>E2092</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Figlioli G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Koehler A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Chen B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Elisei R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Romei C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Cipollini M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Cristaudo A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Bambi F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Paolicchi E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Hoffmann P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Herms S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Kalemba M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Kula D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Pastor S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Marcos R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Velázquez A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Jarząb B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Landi S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Hemminki K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="19" name="Foersti A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="20" name="Gemignani F" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25029422</PMID><DOI>10.1210/jc.2014-1734</DOI><KST>C050</KST><KEYWORD>carcinoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POLYMORPHISMS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BREAST-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POPULATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FOXD3</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMMON VARIANTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>susceptibility loci</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RNA HELICASES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FOXE1</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53419</publishedID><Artikel>Immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis shares genetic susceptibility with multiple myeloma</Artikel><Journal>Leukemia</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>28 (11), 2254-2256</Feld596><PubVol>28</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>2254</StrtPage><EndPage>2256</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Weinhold N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Foersti A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="da Silva Filho MI" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Nickel J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Campo C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hoffmann P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Noethen MM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Hose D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Goldschmidt H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Jauch A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Langer C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Hegenbart U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Schoenland SO" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Hemminki K" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24990613</PMID><DOI>10.1038/leu.2014.208</DOI><KST>C050</KST><KEYWORD>CYCLIN D1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FORMS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>polymorphism</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53422</publishedID><Artikel>Standardized accuracy assessment of the calypso wireless transponder tracking system</Artikel><Journal>Physics in Medicine and Biology</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>59 (22), 6797-6810</Feld596><PubVol>59</PubVol><PubIss>22</PubIss><StrtPage>6797</StrtPage><EndPage>6810</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Franz AM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Schmitt D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Seitel A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Chatrasingh M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Echner G" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Oelfke U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Nill S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Birkfellner W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Maier-Hein L" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25332308</PMID><DOI>10.1088/0031-9155/59/22/6797</DOI><KST>E040</KST><KST>E131</KST></row><row><publishedID>53423</publishedID><Artikel>Emigration flows from North Africa to Europe</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Public Health</Journal><ABSTr>The region of North Africa (NA) represents a striking locality regarding migration with several migration patterns, namely emigration in the form of labour export to Europe and North America and, to a lesser extent, to the Arab Gulf area. The latter has increased enormously in the last decade because of the political instability in most of the NA countries. The aim of the present chapter was to explore the patterns of migration stocks and flows in NA countries, based on several websites, systematic review of journals, comparable data available by the United Nations and by the International Organization of Migration. The NA region has become an area of transit migration and labour migration. Emigrant flows from NA countries towards Europe and North America are increasing this decade more than towards the Arab Gulf countries after being replaced by Asian labour. The recent increase in the proportion of women among the migrant population is remarkable. Remittances sent by African migrants have become an important source of external finance for countries of origin. Transient and irregular migration to Egypt originates at the borders with Sudan, Palestine and Libya with destination to the Euro Mediterranean countries. In Tunisia and Morocco, irregular migrants originate from Sub-Saharan Africa to the northern borders. The NA countries serve as departure rather than destination countries, and migration flows to the Euro-Mediterranean countries through legal or illegal routes.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>24 (Suppl 1), 2-5</Feld596><PubVol>24</PubVol><PubIss>Suppl 1</PubIss><StrtPage>2</StrtPage><EndPage>5</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kassar H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Marzouk D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Anwar WA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Lakhoua C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Hemminki K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Khyatti M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25107991</PMID><DOI>10.1093/eurpub/cku105</DOI><KST>C050</KST></row><row><publishedID>53424</publishedID><Artikel>Impact of Immigration on HIV-1 molecular epidemiology in West Africa, Maghreb and Southern Europe</Artikel><Journal>AIDS Reviews</Journal><ABSTr>There is global concern about the relation between international migration and the course of the AIDS epidemic. Maghreb is a North African region, which lies between sub-Saharan Africa and Europe. It has been turned recently into a region of immigration, since there are more and more flows of West African migrants hoping to reach European countries. Here we provide an overview on HIV-1 molecular epidemiology particularly in West African countries, Maghreb (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia) and southern European countries (Spain, France, and Italy). The studies conducted in several countries of the region revealed different features of HIV-1 molecular epidemiology, especially for the distribution of viral subtypes and for transmitted drug resistance profiles. Furthermore, migration from West Africa to Europe seems to be a potential source of non-B subtype mobility to Maghreb and eventually to southern Europe, where HIV-1 non-B variants significantly increased in the last 10 to 15 years. As genetic differences between subtypes might impact the drug resistance pathways, it is important to provide continuous surveillance programs for the early detection of new variants spreading in the population before they become more prevalent, and to identify resistance profiles in different infected populations, especially migrants.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>16 (2), 109-116</Feld596><PubVol>16</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>109</StrtPage><EndPage>116</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Miri L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Wakrim L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kassar H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Hemminki K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Khyatti M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24802562</PMID><KST>C050</KST><KEYWORD>TYPE-1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIVERSITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEASE INHIBITORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DRUG-RESISTANCE MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NON-B SUBTYPES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANTIRETROVIRAL TREATMENT-NAIVE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INCREASING PREVALENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PRIMARY INFECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POL GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CRF02-AG</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53437</publishedID><Artikel>Consanguinity and genetic diseases in North Africa and immigrants to Europe</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Public Health</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>24 (1), 157-163</Feld596><PubVol>24</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>157</StrtPage><EndPage>163</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Anwar WA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Khyatti M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Hemminki K" IsDKFZ="1"/><KST>C050</KST></row><row><publishedID>53440</publishedID><Artikel>Multiple primary (even in situ) melanomas in a patient pose significant risk to family members</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Background: We aimed at assessing familial risk of melanoma by considering a detailed family history of multiple primary (invasive/in situ) melanomas (MPM), stratified by histology and location.

Methods: Among 65,429 melanoma patients diagnosed in 1958-2010 in the Swedish Family-Cancer Database, there were 4248 patients with familial melanoma. A detailed family history of MPM was investigated by number of melanomas in one first-degree relative (FDR) and in &gt;= 2 FDRs. Familial melanoma risk was assessed by standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) comparing those with family history of melanoma to those without. Combining invasive/in situ melanoma was due to essentially identical familial risks.

Results: For one affected FDR, familial risk increased from SIR = 2.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.2-2.3) for single melanoma to 16.3 (9.5-26.1) for &gt;= 5 melanomas, while for &gt;= 2 affected FDRs, the risk increased from 5.5 (4.8-6.2) for single melanoma to 23.9 (13.6-38.8) for &gt;= 2 melanomas. Significantly higher familial risks for superficial spreading melanoma (SSM) [2.5 (2.3-2.6)] than lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM) [1.8 (1.6-2.1)], and for multiple parts [5.3 (3.1-8.4)] and trunk [2.6 (2.5-2.8)] than head/neck [2.0 (1.8-2.2)] were observed. Only at head/neck, significantly higher risk for SSM [2.4 (1.9-3.0)] than LMM [1.6 (1.4-1.8)] was noted.

Conclusion: We found, for the first time, that familial risks were similar for two/three melanomas in one FDR or for a single melanoma in &gt;= 2 FDRs and, higher familial risks for SSM than LMM occurred only at head/neck. This study provides new evidence for genetic counselling in melanoma, suggesting the need for considering not only the number of affected family members but also the diagnosis of MPM (even in situ) in relatives.

Increased risk of NHL associated with personal histories of some autoimmune diseases (ADs) is known. It is unclear whether there are other NHL-related ADs and whether this association holds across different sex, age and year of diagnosis, or NHL histological subtypes.

Patients and methods: Over an average of 9.4-year (maximum 47 years) follow-up of 878 161 patients diagnosed in 1964-2010 with 33 different ADs, 3096 subsequent NHL were diagnosed (data: Swedish Cancer Registry).

Results: Of 33 studied ADs, 21 showed significantly increased risk of NHL; 6 of them tended to increase the risk and none significantly decreased it. The overall standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for NHL after ADs was 1.6 [novel findings: immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) = 7.5, polymyositis/dermatomyositis = 4.1, primary biliary cirrhosis = 3.9, myasthenia gravis = 2.2, Behcet = 1.7, rheumatoid fever = 1.7, ulcerative colitis = 1.5, polymyalgia rheumatica = 1.4, and chronic rheumatic heart disease = 1.4; confirmatory findings: autoimmune hemolytic anemia = 27.2, Sjgren = 4.9, Celiac = 4.8, systemic lupus erythematosus = 4.4, polyarteritis nodosa = 2.9, discoid lupus erythematosus = 2.7, sarcoidosis = 2.6, Crohn = 2.1, systemic sclerosis = 2.1, rheumatoid arthritis = 2.0, and Hashimoto/hypothyroidism and psoriasis = 1.4]. SIR for NHL diagnosis before age 60 (2.2) was significantly higher than that in older ages (age = 60: 1.5). The SIRs in women or men and in period 1993-2010 or 1964-1992 were similar. Risk of all common NHL histology subtypes significantly increased after ADs (cutaneous/peripheral T cell and anaplastic large T and null cell = 2.2; small B-cell lymphocytic = 1.7; diffuse large B cell = 1.6; follicular and mantel cell = 1.3).

Conclusion: Many of 33 studied ADs (except for ankylosing spondylitis, diabetes type I graves/hyperthyroidism, multiple sclerosis, chorea minor, and pernicious anemia), especially when diagnosed at younger ages, were associated with higher risk of NHL. However, the absolute risk of NHL in many ADs is still small.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>25 (10), 2025-2030</Feld596><PubVol>25</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>2025</StrtPage><EndPage>2030</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Fallah M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Liu X" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Ji J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Foersti A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Sundquist K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hemminki K" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25081899</PMID><DOI>10.1093/annonc/mdu365</DOI><KST>C050</KST><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MORTALITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUSCEPTIBILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MALIGNANCIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SWEDEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISORDERS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MULTIPLE-MYELOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FAMILIAL RISKS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER INCIDENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HOSPITALIZATIONS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53446</publishedID><Artikel>Foreword: Euro-Mediterranean partnership and EUNAM</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Public Health</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>24 (1), 1-1</Feld596><PubVol>24</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>1</StrtPage><EndPage>1</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hemminki,K" IsDKFZ="1"/><KST>C050</KST></row><row><publishedID>53447</publishedID><Artikel>Cancer in immigrants as a pointer to the causes of cancer</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Public Health</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>24 (1), 64-71</Feld596><PubVol>24</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>64</StrtPage><EndPage>71</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hemminki K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Foersti A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Khyatti M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Anwar WA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Mousavi M" IsDKFZ="0"/><KST>C050</KST></row><row><publishedID>53451</publishedID><Artikel>Immigrant health, our health</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Public Health</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>24 (1), 92-95</Feld596><PubVol>24</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>92</StrtPage><EndPage>95</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hemminki,K" IsDKFZ="1"/><KST>C050</KST></row><row><publishedID>53453</publishedID><Artikel>Infectious diseases in North Africa and North African immigrants to Europe</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Public Health</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>24 (1), 47-56</Feld596><PubVol>24</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>47</StrtPage><EndPage>56</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Khyatti M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Trimbitas RD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Zouheir Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Benani A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="El Messaoudi MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hemminki K" IsDKFZ="1"/><KST>C050</KST></row><row><publishedID>53456</publishedID><Artikel>Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms within Interferon Signaling Pathway Genes Are Associated with Colorectal Cancer Susceptibility and Survival</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>Interferon (IFN) signaling has been suggested to play an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis. Our study aimed to examine potentially functional genetic variants in interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), IRF5, IRF7, type I and type II IFN and their receptor genes with respect to colorectal cancer (CRC) risk and clinical outcome. Altogether 74 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were covered by the 34 SNPs genotyped in a hospital-based case-control study of 1327 CRC cases and 758 healthy controls from the Czech Republic. We also analyzed these SNPs in relation to overall survival and event-free survival in a subgroup of 483 patients. Seven SNPs in IFNA1, IFNA13, IFNA21, IFNK, IFNAR1 and IFNGR1 were associated with CRC risk. After multiple testing correction, the associations with the SNPs rs2856968 (IFNAR1) and rs2234711 (IFNGR1) remained formally significant (P = 0.0015 and P&lt;0.0001, respectively). Multivariable survival analyses showed that the SNP rs6475526 (IFNA7/IFNA14) was associated with overall survival of the patients (P = 0.041 and event-free survival among patients without distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis, P = 0.034). The hazard ratios (HRs) for rs6475526 remained statistically significant even after adjustment for age, gender, grade and stage (P = 0.029 and P = 0.036, respectively), suggesting that rs6475526 is an independent prognostic marker for CRC. Our data suggest that genetic variation in the IFN signaling pathway genes may play a role in the etiology and survival of CRC and further studies are warranted.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (10), e111061-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>e111061</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Lu S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Pardini B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Cheng B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Naccarati A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Huhn S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Vymetalkova V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Vodickova L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Buchler T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Hemminki K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Vodicka P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Foersti A" IsDKFZ="1"/><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0111061</DOI><KST>C050</KST><KEYWORD>PROMOTER POLYMORPHISMS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PREDISPOSITION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IDENTIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL-LINES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>colon</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOME-WIDE METAANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IFN-GAMMA RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALPHA PROMOTES</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53459</publishedID><Artikel>.

Methods: We further investigated the association of rs10235235 with breast cancer risk in a large case control study of 47,346 cases and 47,570 controls from 52 studies participating in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium. Genotyping of rs10235235 was conducted using a custom Illumina Infinium array. Stratified analyses were conducted to determine whether this association was modified by age at diagnosis, ethnicity, age at menarche or tumor characteristics.

Results: We confirmed the association of rs10235235 with breast cancer risk for women of European ancestry but found no evidence that this association differed with age at diagnosis. Heterozygote and homozygote odds ratios (ORs) were OR = 0.98 (95% CI 0.94, 1.01; P = 0.2) and OR = 0.80 (95% CI 0.69, 0.93; P = 0.004), respectively (P-trend = 0.02). There was no evidence of effect modification by tumor characteristics. rs10235235 was, however, associated with age at menarche in controls (P-trend = 0.005) but not cases (P-trend = 0.97). Consequently the association between rs10235235 and breast cancer risk differed according to age at menarche (P-het = 0.02); the rare allele of rs10235235 was associated with a reduction in breast cancer risk for women who had their menarche age &gt;= 15 years (ORhet = 0.84, 95% CI 0.75, 0.94; ORhom = 0.81, 95% CI 0.51, 1.30; P-trend = 0.002) but not for those who had their menarche age &lt;= 11 years (ORhet = 1.06, 95% CI 0.95, 1.19, ORhom = 1.07, 95% CI 0.67, 1.72; P-trend = 0.29).

Conclusions: To our knowledge rs10235235 is the first single nucleotide polymorphism to be associated with both breast cancer risk and age at menarche consistent with the well-documented association between later age at menarche and a reduction in breast cancer risk. These associations are likely mediated via an effect on circulating hormone levels.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>16 (3),

We report here the results of a GWAS of UBC including 1670 UBC cases and 90 180 controls, followed by replication analysis in additional 5266 UBC cases and 10 456 controls. We tested a dataset containing 34.2 million variants, generated by imputation based on whole-genome sequencing of 2230 Icelanders. Several correlated variants at 20p12, represented by rs62185668, show genome-wide significant association with UBC after combining discovery and replication results (OR = 1.19, P = 1.5 x 10(-11) for rs62185668-A, minor allele frequency = 23.6%). The variants are located in a non-coding region approximately 300 kb upstream from the JAG1 gene, an important component of the Notch signaling pathways that may be oncogenic or tumor suppressive in several forms of cancer. Our results add to the growing number of UBC risk variants discovered through GWAS.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (20),

results from the Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium and a meta-analysis on 79 000 women</Artikel><Journal>Human Molecular Genetics</Journal><ABSTr>We studied the interplay between 39 breast cancer (BC) risk SNPs and established BC risk (body mass index, height, age at menarche, parity, age at menopause, smoking, alcohol and family history of BC) and prognostic factors (TNM stage, tumor grade, tumor size, age at diagnosis, estrogen receptor status and progesterone receptor status) as joint determinants of BC risk. We used a nested case-control design within the National Cancer Institute's Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3), with 16 285 BC cases and 19 376 controls. We performed stratified analyses for both the risk and prognostic factors, testing for heterogeneity for the risk factors, and case-case comparisons for differential associations of polymorphisms by subgroups of the prognostic factors. We analyzed multiplicative interactions between the SNPs and the risk factors. Finally, we also performed a meta-analysis of the interaction ORs from BPC3 and the Breast Cancer Association Consortium. After correction for multiple testing, no significant interaction between the SNPs and the established risk factors in the BPC3 study was found. The meta-analysis showed a suggestive interaction between smoking status and SLC4A7-rs4973768 (P-interaction = 8.84 x 10(-4)) which, although not significant after considering multiple comparison, has a plausible biological explanation. In conclusion, in this study of up to almost 79 000 women we can conclusively exclude any novel major interactions between genome-wide association studies hits and the epidemiologic risk factors taken into consideration, but we propose a suggestive interaction between smoking status and SLC4A7-rs4973768 that if further replicated could help our understanding in the etiology of BC.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (19), 5260-5270</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>19</PubIss><StrtPage>5260</StrtPage><EndPage>5270</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Barrdahl M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Canzian F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Joshi AD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Travis RC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Chang-Claude J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Auer PL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Gapstur SM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Gaudet M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Diver WR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Henderson BE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Haiman CA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Schumacher FR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Le Marchand L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Berg CD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Chanock SJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Hoover RN" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Rudolph A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Ziegler RG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Giles GG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Baglietto L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Severi G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Hankinson SE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Lindström S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Willet W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Hunter DJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Buring JE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Lee IM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Zhang S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Dossus L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Cox DG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Lund E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Naccarati A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Peeters PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Quirós JR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Sund M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Trichopoulos D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Prentice RL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Kraft P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Kaaks R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="41" name="Campa D."

The reported results for BCLs are however inconsistent. We carried out a nested case-control study to determine whether TL is associated with future risk of BCL. Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, the relative TL (i.e. the ratio of telomere repeat copy number to single gene copy number) was measured in mononuclear cell DNA of prediagnostic peripheral blood samples of 464 lymphoma cases and 464 matched controls (median time between blood collection and diagnosis, 4.6 years). Conditional logistic regression was used to analyze the association between TL and the risk of developing lymphoma and histologic subtypes. TL was significantly longer in cases compared to controls (p 5 0.01). Multivariable models showed a significantly increased risk of BCL [odds ratio (OR) = 1.66, 1.80 and 3.20 for quartiles 2-4, respectively, p-trend = 0.001], diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (OR = 1.20, 2.48 and 2.36 for quartiles 2-4, respectively, p-trend = 0.03) and follicular lymphoma (FL) (OR = 1.39, 1.90 and 2.69 for quartiles 2-4, respectively, p-trend = 0.02) with increasing TL. This study suggests an association between longer leucocyte TL and increased risk of BCL which was most pronounced for DLBCL and FL.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>135 (12), 2910-2917</Feld596><PubVol>135</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>2910</StrtPage><EndPage>2917</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hosnijeh FS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Matullo G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Russo A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Guarrera S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Modica F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Nieters A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Guldberg P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Tjønneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Canzian F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Aleksandrova K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Lagiou P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Trichopoulos D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Tagliabue G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Panico S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Palli D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Olsen KS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Dorronsoro M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Ardanaz E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Chirlaque MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Sánchez MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Quirós JR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Venceslá A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Melin B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Johansson AS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Nilsson P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Borgquist S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Peeters PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Onland-Moret NC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Travis RC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Wareham N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Brennan P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Ferrari P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Gunter MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Vineis P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Vermeulen R" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24771230</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28934</DOI><KST>C055</KST><KST>C025</KST><KEYWORD>PREDISPOSITION FACTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DYSFUNCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NON-HODGKIN-LYMPHOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>hypothesis</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BREAST-CANCER RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STRESS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BLADDER-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CIGARETTE-SMOKING</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53516</publishedID><Artikel>Variants associated with susceptibility to pancreatic cancer and melanoma do not reciprocally affect risk</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers and Prevention</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (6), 1121-1124</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>1121</StrtPage><EndPage>1124</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Wu L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Goldstein AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Yu K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Yang XR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Rabe KG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Arslan AA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Canzian F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Wolpin BM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Stolzenberg-Solomon R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Amundadottir LT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Petersen GM."

As part of our ongoing investigations into the development of improved GRPr antagonists, this study aimed at verifying whether and how N-terminal modulations improve the affinity and pharmacokinetics of radiolabeled GRPr antagonists. Methods: The potent GRPr antagonist MJ9, Pip-o-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2 (Pip, 4-amino-1-carboxymethyl-piperidine), was conjugated to 1,4,7-triazacyclononane, 1-glutaric acid-4,7 acetic acid (NODAGA), and 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (NOTA) and radiolabeled with Ga-66 and Cu-64. The GRPr affinity of the corresponding metalloconjugates was determined using I-125-Tyr(4)-BN as a radioligand. The labeling efficiency of Ga-68(3+) was compared between NODAGA-MJ9 and NOTA-MJ9 in acetate buffer, at room temperature and at 95 degrees C. The Ga-68 and Cu-64 conjugates were further evaluated in vivo in PC3 tumor xenografts by biodistribution and PET imaging studies. Results: The half maximum inhibitory concentrations of all the metalloconjugates are in the high picomolar-low nanomolar range, and these are the most affine-radiolabeled GRPr antagonists we have studied so far in our laboratory. NODAGA-MJ9 incorporates Ga-68(3+) nearly quantitatively (&gt;98%) at room temperature within 10 min and at much lower peptide concentrations (1.4 x 10(-6) M) than NOTA-MJ9, for which the labeling yield was approximately 45% under the same conditions and increased to 75% at 95 degrees C for 5 min. Biodistribution studies showed high and specific tumor uptake, with a maximum of 23.3 +/- 2.0 percentage injected activity per gram of tissue (%IA/g) for Ga-68-NOTA-MJ9 and 16.7 +/- 2.0 %IA/g for Ga-68-NODAGA-MJ9 at 1 h after injection. The acquisition of PET images with the Cu-64-MJ9 conjugates at later time points clearly showed the efficient clearance of the accumulated activity from the background already at 4 h after injection, whereas tumor uptake still remained high. The high pancreas uptake for all radiotracers at 1 h after injection was rapidly washed out, resulting in an increased tumor-to-pancreas ratio at later time points. Conclusion: We have developed 2 GRPr antagonistic radioligands, which are improved in terms of binding affinity and overall biodistribution profile. Their promising in vivo pharmacokinetic performance may contribute to the improvement of the diagnostic imaging of tumors overexpressing GRPr.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>55 (10), 1719-1725</Feld596><PubVol>55</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>1719</StrtPage><EndPage>1725</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Gourni,E."

We have previously established a system for efficient post-entry targeting by insertion of synthetic microRNA target sites (miRTS) into the MV genome, thereby repressing replication in the presence of cognate microRNAs. Thus, differential expression of microRNAs, as frequently observed in normal compared with malignant tissues, can be exploited to increase vector specificity and safety. Here we report the combination of miRTS for different microRNAs in a single vector to detarget pivotal organs at risk during systemic administration (liver, brain, gastrointestinal tract). Accordingly, miRTS for miR-122, miR-7 and miR-148a that are enriched in these tissues were inserted to create multi-tissue-detargeted MV (MV-EGFP(mtd)). Replication of MV-EGFP(mtd) is repressed in cell lines as well as in non-transformed primary human hepatocytes and liver slices expressing cognate microRNAs. Oncolytic potency of MV-EGFP(mtd) is retained in a model of pancreatic cancer in vitro and in vivo. This work is a proof-of-concept that favorable expression profiles of multiple microRNAs can be exploited concomitantly to reshape the tropism of MV without compromising oncolytic efficacy. This strategy can be adapted to different vectors and cancer entities for safe and efficient high-dose systemic administration in clinical trials.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>21 (9), 373-380</Feld596><PubVol>21</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>373</StrtPage><EndPage>380</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Baertsch MA" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Leber MF" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bossow S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Singh M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Engeland CE" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Albert J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Grossardt C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Jaeger D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="von Kalle C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Ungerechts G" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25145311</PMID><DOI>10.1038/cgt.2014.40</DOI><KST>G100</KST><KST>D120</KST><KEYWORD>CHEMOVIROTHERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLYCOPROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VIROTHERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REPLICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>adenocarcinoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENTRY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MESSENGER-RNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>liver</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53657</publishedID><Artikel>A transgenic mouse model demonstrating the oncogenic role of mutations in the polycomb-group gene EZH2 in lymphomagenesis</Artikel><Journal>Blood</Journal><ABSTr>The histone methyltransferase EZH2 is frequently mutated in germinal center-derived diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. To further characterize these EZH2 mutations in lymphomagenesis, we generated a mouse line where EZH2(Y641F) is expressed from a lymphocyte-specific promoter. Spleen cells isolated from the transgenic mice displayed a global increase in trimethylated H3K27, but the mice did not show an increased tendency to develop lymphoma. As EZH2 mutations often coincide with other mutations in lymphoma, we combined the expression of EZH2(Y641F) by crossing these transgenic mice with Emicro-Myc transgenic mice. We observed a dramatic acceleration of lymphoma development in this combination model of Myc and EZH2(Y641F). The lymphomas show histologic features of high-grade disease with a shift toward a more mature B-cell phenotype, increased cycling and gene expression, and epigenetic changes involving important pathways in B-cell regulation and function. Furthermore, they initiate disease in secondary recipients. In summary, EZH2(Y641F) can collaborate with Myc to accelerate lymphomagenesis demonstrating a cooperative role of EZH2 mutations in oncogenesis. This murine lymphoma model provides a new tool to study global changes in the epigenome caused by this frequent mutation and a promising model system for testing novel treatments.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>123 (25), 3914-3924</Feld596><PubVol>123</PubVol><PubIss>25</PubIss><StrtPage>3914</StrtPage><EndPage>3924</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Berg T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Thoene S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Yap D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Wee T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schoeler N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Rosten P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Lim E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Bilenky M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Mungall AJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Oellerich T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Lee S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Lai CK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Umlandt P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Salmi A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Chang H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Yue L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Lai D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Cheng SW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Morin RD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Hirst M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Serve H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="21" name="Marra MA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Morin GB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Gascoyne RD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Aparicio SA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Humphries RK" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24802772</PMID><DOI>10.1182/blood-2012-12-473439</DOI><KST>G300</KST><KST>L501</KST><KEYWORD>ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC-LEUKEMIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STEM-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION PATTERNS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>B-CELL LYMPHOMAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SOMATIC MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NON-HODGKIN-LYMPHOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INACTIVATING MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HISTONE METHYLTRANSFERASE EZH2</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REPRESSIVE COMPLEX 2</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROUP PROTEINS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53658</publishedID><Artikel>Impact of routinely employed procedures for tissue processing on the proteomic analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue</Artikel><Journal>Proteomics Clinical Applications</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: FFPE (formalin fixed, paraffin embedded) tissue cohorts represent an enduring archive of clinical specimens. Proteomic analysis of FFPE tissues is gaining interest for the in-depth analysis of aberrant proteome composition. Procedures for FFPE tissue processing are standardized but there is diversity regarding the different processing systems. This work focuses on three different processing methods commonly used in large European pathology institutes. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Formalin fixed tissue specimens of different tumors were serially sliced and processed with three different processing systems (xylene, ethanol/vacuum or microwave based). After paraffin embedding, they were subjected to MS-based proteomic analysis to investigate the impact of tissue processing techniques on the quality of proteomic analysis. Results were compared with proteomic analysis of corresponding cryopreserved tissue specimens. RESULTS: All processing techniques achieved very good proteome coverage similar to the cryopreserved counterpart. Gene ontology profiles, relative protein abundances, and peptide modifications such as methionine oxidation or proteolytic truncation were highly similar for all techniques as well as for the cryopreserved samples. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The results show that different processing procedures do not impede proteomic analysis as a robust and powerful approach for the identification of protein determinants and markers of disease processes and highlights the general robustness of FFPE-tissue based proteomics.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>8 (10), 796-804</Feld596><PubVol>8</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>796</StrtPage><EndPage>804</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Bronsert P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Weisser J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Biniossek ML" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kuehs M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Mayer B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Drendel V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Timme S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Shahinian H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Kusters S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Wellner UF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Lassmann S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Werner M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Schilling O" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24888792</PMID><KST>L601</KST></row><row><publishedID>53659</publishedID><Artikel>Validation of ZAP-70 methylation and its relative significance in predicting outcome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia</Artikel><Journal>Blood</Journal><ABSTr>ZAP-70 methylation 223 nucleotides downstream of transcription start (CpG+223) predicts outcome in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), but its impact relative to CD38 and ZAP-70 expression or immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV) status is uncertain. Additionally, standardizing ZAP-70 expression analysis has been unsuccessful. CpG+223 methylation was quantitatively determined in 295 untreated CLL cases using MassARRAY. Impact on clinical outcome vs CD38 and ZAP-70 expression and IGHV status was evaluated. Cases with low methylation (&lt;20%) had significantly shortened time to first treatment (TT) and overall survival (OS) (P &lt; .0001). For TT, low methylation defined a large subset of ZAP-70 protein-negative cases with significantly shortened TT (median, 8.0 vs 3.9 years for high vs low methylation; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25-0.74). Conversely, 16 ZAP-70 protein-positive cases with high methylation had poor outcome (median, 1.1 vs 2.3 years for high vs low methylation; HR = 1.62; 95% CI, 0.87-3.03). For OS, ZAP-70 methylation was the strongest risk factor; CD38 and ZAP-70 expression or IGHV status did not significantly improve OS prediction. A pyrosequencing assay was established that reproduced the MassARRAY data (kappa coefficient &gt; 0.90). Thus, ZAP-70 CpG+223 methylation represents a superior biomarker for TT and OS that can be feasibly measured, supporting its use in risk-stratifying CLL.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>124 (1), 42-48</Feld596><PubVol>124</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>42</StrtPage><EndPage>48</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Claus R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Lucas DM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Ruppert AS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Williams KE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Weng D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Patterson K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Zucknick M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Oakes CC" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Rassenti LZ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Greaves AW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Geyer S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Wierda WG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Brown JR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Gribben JG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Barrientos JC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Rai KR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Kay NE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Kipps TJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Shields P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Zhao W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Grever MR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Plass C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="22" name="Byrd JC" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24868078</PMID><DOI>10.1182/blood-2014-02-555722</DOI><KST>C010</KST><KST>C060</KST><KEYWORD>IBRUTINIB</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AGREEMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTATION STATUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EVOLUTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CD38 EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ABERRATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA methylation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53660</publishedID><Artikel>Randomized, phase 2 trial of low-dose cytarabine with or without volasertib in AML patients not suitable for induction therapy</Artikel><Journal>Blood</Journal><ABSTr>Treatment outcomes for older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have remained dismal. This randomized, phase 2 trial in AML patients not considered suitable for intensive induction therapy compared low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) with or without volasertib, a highly potent and selective inhibitor of polo-like kinases. Eighty-seven patients (median age 75 years) received LDAC 20 mg twice daily subcutaneously days 1-10 or LDAC + volasertib 350 mg IV days 1 + 15 every 4 weeks. Response rate (complete remission and complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery) was higher for LDAC + volasertib vs LDAC (31.0% vs 13.3%; odds ratio, 2.91; P = .052). Responses in the LDAC + volasertib arm were observed across all genetic groups, including 5 of 14 patients with adverse cytogenetics. Median event-free survival was significantly prolonged by LDAC + volasertib compared with LDAC (5.6 vs 2.3 months; hazard ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.92; P = .021); median overall survival was 8.0 vs 5.2 months, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% confidence interval, 0.40-1.00; P = .047). LDAC + volasertib led to an increased frequency of adverse events that was most pronounced for neutropenic fever/infections and gastrointestinal events; there was no increase in the death rate at days 60 + 90.

To identify the molecular processes associated with HSCs located in the 2 different microenvironments, we compared the expression profiles of HSCs present in the liver and BM of perinatal mice. This revealed the higher expression of a cluster of extracellular matrix-related genes in BM HSCs, with secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) being one of the most significant ones. This extracellular matrix protein has been described to be involved in tissue development, repair, and remodeling, as well as metastasis formation. Here we demonstrate that SPARC-deficient mice display higher resistance to serial treatment with the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Using straight and reverse chimeras, we further show that this protective effect is not due to a role of SPARC in HSCs, but rather is due to its function in the BM niche. Although the kinetics of recovery of the hematopoietic system is normal, HSCs in a SPARC-deficient niche show an accelerated return to quiescence, protecting them from the lethal effects of serial 5-FU treatment. This may become clinically relevant, as SPARC inhibition and its protective effect on HSCs could be used to optimize chemotherapy schemes.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>123 (26), 4054-4063</Feld596><PubVol>123</PubVol><PubIss>26</PubIss><StrtPage>4054</StrtPage><EndPage>4063</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ehninger A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Boch T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Medyouf H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Mudder K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Orend G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Trumpp A" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24833352</PMID><DOI>10.1182/blood-2013-10-533711</DOI><KST>A010</KST><KST>V960</KST><KEYWORD>5Q-SYNDROME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BONE-MARROW NICHE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HIBERNATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MAINTENANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NULL MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACUTE MYELOID-LEUKEMIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TGF-BETA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROMOTES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HOMEOSTASIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>5-FLUOROURACIL</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53665</publishedID><Artikel>Cancer Core Europe: A consortium to address the cancer care - Cancer research continuum challenge</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>European cancer research for a transformative initiative by creating a consortium of six leading excellent comprehensive cancer centres that will work together to address the cancer care-cancer research continuum. Prerequisites for joint translational and clinical research programs are very demanding. These require the creation of a virtual single 'e-hospital' and a powerful translational platform, inter-compatible clinical molecular profiling laboratories with a robust underlying computational biology pipeline, standardised functional and molecular imaging, commonly agreed Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for liquid and tissue biopsy procurement, storage and processing, for molecular diagnostics, 'omics', functional genetics, immune-monitoring and other assessments. Importantly also it requires a culture of data collection and data storage that provides complete longitudinal data sets to allow for: effective data sharing and common database building, and to achieve a level of completeness of data that is required for conducting outcome research, taking into account our current understanding of cancers as communities of evolving clones. Cutting edge basic research and technology development serve as an important driving force for innovative translational and clinical studies. Given the excellent track records of the six participants in these areas, Cancer Core Europe will be able to support the full spectrum of research required to address the cancer research- cancer care continuum.

However, it remains largely unclear how c-Myc expression is regulated in this context. Here, we show that HSCs and more committed progenitors express similar levels of c-myc transcripts. Using knock-in mice expressing a functional enhanced green fluorescent protein-c-Myc fusion protein under control of the endogenous c-myc locus, c-Myc protein levels were assessed. Although HSCs express low levels of c-Myc protein, its expression increases steadily during progenitor differentiation. Thus, mRNA and protein expression patterns differ significantly in stem/progenitor cells, suggesting that c-Myc expression is largely controlled posttranscriptionally. Moreover, interferon-alpha exposure, which activates dormant HSCs, strongly induces c-Myc expression at the protein level but not at the transcript level. This posttranscriptional mechanism of c-Myc regulation provides the blood system with a rapid way to adjust c-Myc expression according to demand during hematopoietic stress.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>123 (25), 3909-3913</Feld596><PubVol>123</PubVol><PubIss>25</PubIss><StrtPage>3909</StrtPage><EndPage>3913</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ehninger A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Boch T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Uckelmann H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Essers MA" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Muedder K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Sleckman BP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Trumpp A" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24795346</PMID><DOI>10.1182/blood-2013-10-531038</DOI><KST>A010</KST><KST>V960</KST><KST>A011</KST><KEYWORD>LYMPHOCYTE DEVELOPMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTESTINAL CRYPTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIFFERENTIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEMATOPOIETIC STEM-CELLS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53669</publishedID><Artikel>Prediagnostic circulating vitamin D levels and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in European populations: a nested case-control study</Artikel><Journal>Hepatology</Journal><ABSTr>The association between vitamin D status and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been well investigated, despite experimental evidence supporting an important role of vitamin D in liver pathophysiology.

Serum baseline levels of 25(OH)D were measured by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Multivariable incident rate ratios (IRRs) of HCC associated with continuous (per 10 nmol/L) or categorical levels (tertiles or a priori-defined categories) of prediagnostic 25(OH)D were calculated using conditional logistic regression. Higher 25(OH)D levels were associated with a 49% reduction in the risk of HCC (highest versus lowest tertile: multivariable IRR = 0.51, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.26 to 0.99; Ptrend = 0.04; per 10 nmol/L increase: IRR = 0.80, 95% CI, 0.68-0.94). The finding did not vary substantially by time from enrolment to diagnosis, and did not change after adjustment for biomarkers of preexisting liver damage, nor chronic infection with hepatitis B or C viruses. The findings were not modified by body size or smoking status. CONCLUSION: In this prospective study on western European populations, serum levels of 25(OH)D were inversely associated with the risk of HCC. Given the rising incidence of this cancer in low-risk developed countries and the strong public health interest surrounding the potentially cancer-protective roles of vitamin D, additional studies in different populations are required.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>60 (4), 1222-1230</Feld596><PubVol>60</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>1222</StrtPage><EndPage>1230</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Fedirko V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Duarte-Salles T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bamia C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Aleksandrova K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Trichopoulos D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Trepo E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Olsen A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Boutron-Ruault MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Clavel-Chapelon F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Kvaskoff M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Kuhn T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Lukanova A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Buijsse B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Klinaki E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Tsimakidi C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Naccarati A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Tagliabue G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Panico S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Palli D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Siersema PD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Peters PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Lund E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Brustad M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Olsen KS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Zamora-Ros R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Sanchez MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Ardanaz E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Amiano P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Navarro C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Quiros JR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Werner M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Sund M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Lindkvist B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Malm J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Travis RC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Stepien M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="44" name="Scalbert A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="45" name="Romieu I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="46" name="Lagiou P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="47" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="48" name="Jenab M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24644045</PMID><DOI>10.1002/hep.27079</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>nutrition</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CALCIUM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>D DEFICIENCY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>25-hydroxyvitamin D</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PARTICIPANTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHRONIC HEPATITIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHRONIC LIVER-DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SEVERE FIBROSIS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53672</publishedID><Artikel>Mitochondrial DNA copy number and future risk of B-cell lymphoma in a nested case-control study in the prospective EPIC cohort</Artikel><Journal>Blood</Journal><ABSTr>It has been suggested that mitochondrial dysfunction and DNA damage are involved in lymphomagenesis. Increased copy number of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) as a compensatory mechanism of mitochondrial dysfunction previously has been associated with B-cell lymphomas, in particular chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, current evidence is limited and based on a relatively small number of cases. Using a nested case-control study, we extended these findings with a focus on subtype-specific analyses. Relative mtDNA copy number was measured in the buffy coat of prospectively collected blood of 469 lymphoma cases and 469 matched controls. The association between mtDNA copy number and the risk of developing lymphoma and histologic subtypes was examined using logistic regression models. We found no overall association between mtDNA and risk of lymphoma. Subtype analyses revealed significant increased risks of CLL (n = 102) with increasing mtDNA copy number (odds ratio = 1.34, 1.44, and 1.80 for quartiles 2-4, respectively; P trend = .001). mtDNA copy number was not associated with follow-up time, suggesting that this observation is not strongly influenced by indolent disease status. This study substantially strengthens the evidence that mtDNA copy number is related to risk of CLL and supports the importance of mitochondrial dysfunction as a possible mechanistic pathway in CLL ontogenesis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>124 (4), 530-535</Feld596><PubVol>124</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>530</StrtPage><EndPage>535</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hosnijeh FS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Lan Q" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Rothman N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="San Liu C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Cheng WL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Nieters A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Guldberg P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Campa D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Martino A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Lagiou P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Trichopoulos D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Krogh V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Panico S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Masala G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Huerta Castano JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Ardanaz E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Sala N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Dorronsoro M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Quiros JR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Sanchez MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Melin B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Johansson AS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Malm J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Borgquist S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Peeters PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Wareham N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Travis RC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Brennan P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Siddiq A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Vineis P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Vermeulen R" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24899624</PMID><DOI>10.1182/blood-2013-10-532085</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>INCREASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BIOGENESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NON-HODGKIN-LYMPHOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BENZENE EXPOSURE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENETIC-VARIANTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>cancer risk</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC-LEUKEMIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OXIDATIVE STRESS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53673</publishedID><Artikel>MicroRNAs play a role in spontaneous recovery from acute liver failure</Artikel><Journal>Hepatology</Journal><ABSTr>Acute liver failure (ALF) represents a life-threatening situation characterized by sudden and massive liver cell death in the absence of preexisting liver disease. Although most patients require liver transplantation to prevent mortality, some recover spontaneously and show complete liver regeneration. Because of the rarity of this disease, the molecular mechanisms regulating liver regeneration in ALF patients remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of microRNAs (miRs) that have been implicated in liver injury and regeneration in sera from ALF patients (n = 63). Patients with spontaneous recovery from ALF showed significantly higher serum levels of miR-122, miR-21, and miR-221, compared to nonrecovered patients. In liver biopsies, miR-21 and miR-221 displayed a reciprocal expression pattern and were found at lower levels in the spontaneous survivors, whereas miR-122 was elevated in both serum and liver tissue of those patients. As compared to nonrecovered patients, liver tissue of spontaneous survivors revealed not only increased hepatocyte proliferation, but also a strong down-regulation of miRNA target genes that impair liver regeneration, including heme oxygenase-1, programmed cell death 4, and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21, p27, and p57. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that miR-122, miR-21, and miR-221 are involved in liver regeneration and might contribute to spontaneous recovery from ALF. Prospective studies will show whether serological detection of those miRNAs might be of prognostic value to predict ALF outcome.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>60 (4), 1346-1355</Feld596><PubVol>60</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>1346</StrtPage><EndPage>1355</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="John K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Hadem J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Krech T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Wahl K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Manns MP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Dooley S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Batkai S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Thum T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Schulze-Osthoff K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Bantel H" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24913549</PMID><DOI>10.1002/hep.27250</DOI><KST>L801</KST><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CIRCULATING MICRORNAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEPATOCYTE PROLIFERATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>regeneration</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FULMINANT HEPATIC-FAILURE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INJURY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53674</publishedID><Artikel>Consortium analysis of gene and gene-folate interactions in purine and pyrimidine metabolism pathways with ovarian carcinoma risk</Artikel><Journal>Molecular Nutrition and Food Research</Journal><ABSTr>SCOPE: We reevaluated previously reported associations between variants in pathways of one-carbon (1-C) (folate) transfer genes and ovarian carcinoma (OC) risk, and in related pathways of purine and pyrimidine metabolism, and assessed interactions with folate intake. METHODS AND RESULTS: Odds ratios (OR) for 446 genetic variants were estimated among 13 410 OC cases and 22 635 controls, and among 2281 cases and 3444 controls with folate information. Following multiple testing correction, the most significant main effect associations were for dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD) variants rs11587873 (OR = 0.92; p = 6 x 10(-5) ) and rs828054 (OR = 1.06; p = 1 x 10(-4) ). Thirteen variants in the pyrimidine metabolism genes, DPYD, DPYS, PPAT, and TYMS, also interacted significantly with folate in a multivariant analysis (corrected p = 9.9 x 10(-6) ) but collectively explained only 0.2% of OC risk. Although no other associations were significant after multiple testing correction, variants in SHMT1 in 1-C transfer, previously reported with OC, suggested lower risk at higher folate (pinteraction = 0.03-0.006). CONCLUSION: Variation in pyrimidine metabolism genes, particularly DPYD, which was previously reported to be associated with OC, may influence risk; however, stratification by folate intake is unlikely to modify disease risk appreciably in these women. SHMT1 SNP-by-folate interactions are plausible but require further validation. Polymorphisms in selected genes in purine metabolism were not associated with OC.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>58 (10),

ESR2 and AR and colorectal cancer risk and prognosis: results from a German population-based case-control study</Artikel><Journal>BMC Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Background: Evidence has accumulated which suggests that sex steroids influence colorectal cancer development and progression. We therefore assessed the association of repeat polymorphisms in the estrogen receptor beta gene (ESR2) and the androgen receptor gene (AR) with colorectal cancer risk and prognosis.

Methods: The ESR2 CA and AR CAG repeat polymorphisms were genotyped in 1798 cases (746 female, 1052 male) and 1810 controls (732 female, 1078 male), matched for sex, age and county of residence. Colorectal cancer risk associations overall and specific for gender were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression models adjusted for sex, county of residence and age. Associations with overall and disease-specific survival were evaluated using Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for established prognostic factors (diagnosis of other cancer after colorectal cancer diagnosis, detection by screening, treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy, tumour extent, nodal status, distant metastasis, body mass index, age at diagnosis and year of diagnosis) and stratified for grade of differentiation. Heterogeneity in gender specific associations was assessed by comparing models with and without a multiplicative interaction term by means of a likelihood ratio test.

Results: The average number of ESR2 CA repeats was associated with a small 5% increase in colorectal cancer risk (OR = 1.05, 95% CI 1.01-1.10) without significant heterogeneity according to gender or tumoural ESR2 expression. We found no indication for an association between the AR CAG repeat polymorphisms and risk of colorectal cancer. The ESR2 CA and AR CAG repeat polymorphisms were not associated with overall survival or disease specific survival after colorectal cancer diagnosis.

Conclusions: Higher numbers of ESR2 CA repeats are potentially associated with a small increase in colorectal cancer risk. Our study does not support an association between colorectal cancer prognosis and the investigated repeat polymorphisms.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>14 (1), 817-817</Feld596><PubVol>14</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>817</StrtPage><EndPage>817</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Rudolph A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Shi H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Foersti A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Hoffmeister M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Sainz J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Jansen L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Hemminki K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Chang-Claude J" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25376484</PMID><DOI>10.1186/1471-2407-14-817</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KST>C050</KST><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>TRANSCRIPTIONAL ACTIVITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLON-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>mechanisms</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ER-BETA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HORMONE-THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ESTROGEN-RECEPTOR-BETA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANDROGEN-RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TESTOSTERONE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53679</publishedID><Artikel>Cardiac CaM Kinase II Genes delta and gamma Contribute to Adverse Remodeling but Redundantly Inhibit Calcineurin-Induced Myocardial Hypertrophy</Artikel><Journal>Circulation</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Ca(2+)-dependent signaling through CaM Kinase II (CaMKII) and calcineurin was suggested to contribute to adverse cardiac remodeling. However, the relative importance of CaMKII versus calcineurin for adverse cardiac remodeling remained unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: We generated double-knockout mice (DKO) lacking the 2 cardiac CaMKII genes delta and gamma specifically in cardiomyocytes. We show that both CaMKII isoforms contribute redundantly to phosphorylation not only of phospholamban, ryanodine receptor 2, and histone deacetylase 4, but also calcineurin. Under baseline conditions, DKO mice are viable and display neither abnormal Ca(2+) handling nor functional and structural changes. On pathological pressure overload and beta-adrenergic stimulation, DKO mice are protected against cardiac dysfunction and interstitial fibrosis. But surprisingly and paradoxically, DKO mice develop cardiac hypertrophy driven by excessive activation of endogenous calcineurin, which is associated with a lack of phosphorylation at the auto-inhibitory calcineurin A site Ser411. Likewise, calcineurin inhibition prevents cardiac hypertrophy in DKO. On exercise performance, DKO mice show an exaggeration of cardiac hypertrophy with increased expression of the calcineurin target gene RCAN1-4 but no signs of adverse cardiac remodeling. CONCLUSIONS: We established a mouse model in which CaMKII's activity is specifically and completely abolished. By the use of this model we show that CaMKII induces maladaptive cardiac remodeling while it inhibits calcineurin-dependent hypertrophy. These data suggest inhibition of CaMKII but not calcineurin as a promising approach to attenuate the progression of heart failure.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>130 (15), 1262-1273</Feld596><PubVol>130</PubVol><PubIss>15</PubIss><StrtPage>1262</StrtPage><EndPage>1273</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kreusser MM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Lehmann LH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Keranov S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Hoting MO" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Oehl U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Kohlhaas M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Reil JC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Neumann K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Schneider MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Hill JA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Dobrev D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Maack C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Maier LS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Groene HJ" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="14" name="Katus HA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Olson EN" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Backs J" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25124496</PMID><DOI>10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.006</DOI><KST>G130</KST><KEYWORD>HEART-FAILURE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DEPENDENT PROTEIN-KINASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BINDING PROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>myocytes</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSCRIPTIONAL PATHWAYS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HISTONE DEACETYLASE-4</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PRESSURE-OVERLOAD</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53680</publishedID><Artikel>Is breastfeeding related to bone properties? A longitudinal analysis of associations between breastfeeding duration and pQCT parameters in children and adolescents</Artikel><Journal>Maternal and Child Nutrition</Journal><ABSTr>Nutritive and bioactive components of human milk could be involved in programming metabolic systems that affect bone growth throughout the life course. Bone properties in childhood and adolescence might differ, depending on breastfeeding duration. Thus, breastfeeding could be a relevant factor in the context of primary osteoporosis prevention. The prospective association between breastfeeding duration and bone properties was investigated using the data of 284 participants of the Dortmund Nutritional and Anthropometric Longitudinally Designed Study. Breastfeeding duration was assessed during infancy. Bone properties were measured by peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) at ages 5-23 years. Cortical volumetric bone mineral density, cortical bone mineral content, strength strain index, total cross-sectional area of the bone and cross-sectional area of the cortical bone were determined at the 65% site of the radius. Linear regression analyses were performed to check for differences in pQCT parameters of subjects who had not or shortly been breastfed (0-16 weeks) and subjects who had been breastfed for a long duration (&gt;/=17 weeks). Multivariable models adjusted for age, gender, forearm length, muscle cross-sectional area, body mass index standard deviation score (SDS), height SDS and socio-economic status did not yield associations between breastfeeding duration and pQCT parameters. These findings suggest neither protective nor adverse effects of prolonged breastfeeding on bone health in childhood and adolescence. Influences of early nutrition on bone growth might be overridden by current effects of mechanical loads on bone physiology.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>10 (4), 642-649</Feld596><PubVol>10</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>642</StrtPage><EndPage>649</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kuehn T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Kroke A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Remer T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schoenau E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Buyken AE" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>22909290</PMID><DOI>10.1111/j.1740-8709.2012.00443</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>QUANTITATIVE COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EARLY DIET</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PREPUBERTAL CHILDREN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>nutrition</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BIRTH-WEIGHT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PRETERM INFANTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MASS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EARLY-LIFE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53681</publishedID><Artikel>Thyroid analytes TSH, FT3 and FT4 in serum of healthy elderly subjects as measured by the Roche modular system: do we need age and gender dependent reference levels?</Artikel><Journal>Clinical Laboratory</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Age and gender may be involved in the regulation of TSH and thyroid hormones. Reliable investigations concerned with the matter of whether or not these factors are of importance for diagnostic evaluation of the thyroid function are scarce. We used serum values of the CARLA study to calculate reference intervals for TSH, FT3, and FT4 and examine these parameters for their association with age or gender. METHODS: The CARLA study included 967 men and 812 women aged 45 to 83 years. We defined a reference group of 1002 subjects that were free of thyroid disease for data analysis by laboratory analysis and questionnaire, calculated age-dependent moving percentiles (2.5th/97.5th) for TSH, FT4, and FT3 and tested this data set for the confounding factors age and gender. Thereafter, the results were compared to data from the Leipzig Blood Donor study established in 2005. RESULTS: TSH (significant in trend (p = 0.064)) and FT3 (p = 0.001) were inversely associated with age. The correlation of FT3 with age was furthermore influenced by gender (p &lt; 0.001). Neither gender nor age influenced values of FT4. CONCLUSIONS: The decreased TSH and FT3 levels with increasing age suggest a diagnostically relevant modification in the feed back regulation of thyroid function of the elderly. FT3 data should thus be interpreted gender-dependent and even age-dependent for males. These findings should be considered for the diagnostic examination of older patients with suspected disorders of thyroid function.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>60 (9), 1551-1559</Feld596><PubVol>60</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>1551</StrtPage><EndPage>1559</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kussmaul T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Greiser KH" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Haerting J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Werdan K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Thiery J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Kratzsch J" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25291952</PMID><DOI>10.7754/Clin.Lab.2014.130328</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>EXCRETION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HORMONE CONCENTRATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REFERENCE INTERVALS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>UNITED-STATES POPULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THYROTROPIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MORTALITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>antibodies</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FUNCTION TESTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXTREME LONGEVITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IODINE INTAKE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53683</publishedID><Artikel>Immunotherapy of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma by targeting the chemokine receptor CXCR5 in a preclinical mouse model</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Bispecific antibodies are promising agents for immunotherapy. Here, we describe a quadroma-based trifunctional bispecific antibody binding the chemokine receptor CXCR5 and the T-cell antigen CD3 that efficiently prevents tumor growth in a mouse B-cell lymphoma model. CXCR5 regulates the tissue homeostasis of mature B cells and is highly expressed on B-cell non-Hodgkin and lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma, as well as on a subset of CD4(+) T cells known as follicular T-helper cells. In vitro, the bispecific CXCR5::CD3 antibody efficiently recruited effector T cells to CXCR5 expressing B cells and induced a co-stimulation-independent activation of CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells as demonstrated by the de novo expression of CD25 and CD69, and secretion of the cytokines IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-10 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Notably, at low antibody concentrations, CXCR5::CD3 displayed a significantly higher cytotoxic activity against autologous B cells than its parental antibodies or rituximab. In vivo imaging revealed that CXCR5::CD3 and its parental CXCR5 antibody efficiently prevent tumor growth in a xenograft model of B-cell lymphoma in mice and prolong their survival. Taken together, our results identify CXCR5 as a promising target for antibody-based therapies in the treatment of B-cell malignancies.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>135 (11), 2623-2632</Feld596><PubVol>135</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>2623</StrtPage><EndPage>2632</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Panjideh H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Mueller G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Koch M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Wilde F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Scheu S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Moldenhauer G" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Lipp M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24729415</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28893</DOI><KST>D015</KST><KEYWORD>TRIFUNCTIONAL ANTIBODY CATUMAXOMAB</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHASE II/III</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>X ANTI-CD3</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CARCINOMA-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC-LEUKEMIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER-THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>T-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>malignant ascites</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BISPECIFIC ANTIBODIES</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53684</publishedID><Artikel>Misinitiation of intrathymic MART-1 transcription and biased TCR usage explain the high frequency of MART-1-specific T cells</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Immunology</Journal><ABSTr>Immunity to tumor differentiation antigens, such as melanoma antigen recognized by T cells 1 (MART-1), has been comprehensively studied. Intriguingly, CD8(+) T cells specific for the MART-1(26(27)-35) epitope in the context of HLA-A0201 are about 100 times more abundant compared with T cells specific for other tumor-associated antigens. Moreover, MART-1-specific CD8(+) T cells show a highly biased usage of the Valpha-region gene TRAV12-2. Here, we provide independent support for this notion, by showing that the combinatorial pairing of different TCRalpha- and TCRbeta- chains derived from HLA-A2-MART-1(26-35) -specific CD8(+) T-cell clones is unusually permissive in conferring MART-1 specificity, provided the CDR1alpha TRAV12-2 region is used. Whether TCR bias alone accounts for the unusual abundance of HLA-A2-MART-1(26-35) -specific CD8(+) T cells has remained conjectural. Here, we provide an alternative explanation: misinitiated transcription of the MART-1 gene resulting in truncated mRNA isoforms leads to lack of promiscuous transcription of the MART-1(26-35) epitope in human medullary thymic epithelial cells and, consequently, evasion of central self-tolerance toward this epitope. Thus, biased TCR usage and leaky central tolerance might act in an independent and additive manner to confer high frequency of MART-1(26-35) -specific CD8(+) T cells.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>44 (9), 2811-2821</Feld596><PubVol>44</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>2811</StrtPage><EndPage>2821</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Pinto S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Sommermeyer D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Michel C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Wilde S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schendel D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Uckert W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Blankenstein T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Kyewski B" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24846220</PMID><DOI>10.1002/eji.201444499</DOI><KST>D090</KST><KEYWORD>MELANOMA-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALPHA-CHAIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>thymic epithelium</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DENDRITIC CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TOLERANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PEPTIDE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>tumor</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PERIPHERAL-TISSUE ANTIGENS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MEDULLARY EPITHELIAL-CELLS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53685</publishedID><Artikel>Requirement for CDK6 in MLL-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia</Artikel><Journal>Blood</Journal><ABSTr>Chromosomal rearrangements involving the H3K4 methyltransferase mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) trigger aberrant gene expression in hematopoietic progenitors and give rise to an aggressive subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Insights into MLL fusion-mediated leukemogenesis have not yet translated into better therapies because MLL is difficult to target directly, and the identity of the genes downstream of MLL whose altered transcription mediates leukemic transformation are poorly annotated. We used a functional genetic approach to uncover that AML cells driven by MLL-AF9 are exceptionally reliant on the cell-cycle regulator CDK6, but not its functional homolog CDK4, and that the preferential growth inhibition induced by CDK6 depletion is mediated through enhanced myeloid differentiation. CDK6 essentiality is also evident in AML cells harboring alternate MLL fusions and a mouse model of MLL-AF9-driven leukemia and can be ascribed to transcriptional activation of CDK6 by mutant MLL. Importantly, the context-dependent effects of lowering CDK6 expression are closely phenocopied by a small-molecule CDK6 inhibitor currently in clinical development. These data identify CDK6 as critical effector of MLL fusions in leukemogenesis that might be targeted to overcome the differentiation block associated with MLL-rearranged AML, and underscore that cell-cycle regulators may have distinct, noncanonical, and nonredundant functions in different contexts.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>124 (1), 13-23</Feld596><PubVol>124</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>13</StrtPage><EndPage>23</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Placke T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Faber K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Nonami A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Putwain SL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Salih HR" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Heidel FH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Kraemer A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Root DE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Barbie DA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Krivtsov AV" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Armstrong SA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Hahn WC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Huntly BJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Sykes SM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Milsom MD" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Scholl C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Froehling S" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24764564</PMID><DOI>10.1182/blood-2014-02-558114</DOI><KST>A010</KST><KST>G330</KST><KST>G100</KST><KST>L801</KST><KST>L101</KST><KST>A012</KST><KEYWORD>MIXED-LINEAGE LEUKEMIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CDK4/6 INHIBITION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NF-KAPPA-B</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STEM-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FUSION PROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SYNTHETIC LETHAL INTERACTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MANTLE CELL LYMPHOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THYMOCYTE DEVELOPMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DEPENDENT KINASE 6</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53686</publishedID><Artikel>RASA4 undergoes DNA hypermethylation in resistant juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia</Artikel><Journal>Epigenetics</Journal><ABSTr>Aberrant DNA methylation at specific genetic loci is a key molecular feature of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) with poor prognosis. Using quantitative high-resolution mass spectrometry, we identified RASA4 isoform 2, which maps to chromosome 7 and encodes a member of the GAP1 family of GTPase-activating proteins for small G proteins, as a recurrent target of isoform-specific DNA hypermethylation in JMML (51% of 125 patients analyzed). RASA4 isoform 2 promoter methylation correlated with clinical parameters predicting poor prognosis (older age, elevated fetal hemoglobin), with higher risk of relapse after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and with PTPN11 mutation. The level of isoform 2 methylation increased in relapsed cases after transplantation. Interestingly, most JMML cases with monosomy 7 exhibited hypermethylation on the remaining RASA4 allele. The results corroborate the significance of epigenetic modifications in the phenotype of aggressive JMML.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (9), 1252-60</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>1252</StrtPage><EndPage>60</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Poetsch AR" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Lipka DB" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Witte T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Claus R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Nollke P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Zucknick M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Olk-Batz C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Fluhr S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Dworzak M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="De Moerloose B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Stary J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Zecca M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Hasle H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Schmugge M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Locatelli F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Niemeyer CM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="17" name="Flotho C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="18" name="Plass C" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25147919</PMID><DOI>10.4161/epi.29941</DOI><KST>C010</KST><KST>C060</KST><KST>L601</KST><KST>L101</KST><KEYWORD>CHILDHOOD</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GTPASE-ACTIVATING PROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHILDREN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHWAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GAP1 FAMILY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>JMML</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PTPN11</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53687</publishedID><Artikel>Stereotactic body radiotherapy for liver tumors : Principles and practical guidelines of the DEGRO Working Group on Stereotactic Radiotherapy</Artikel><Journal>Strahlentherapie und Onkologie</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: This report of the Working Group on Stereotactic Radiotherapy of the German Society of Radiation Oncology (DEGRO) aims to provide a practical guideline for safe and effective stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) of liver tumors.

There were few significant associations with clinical and laboratory characteristics, but genetic markers had a strong influence on response and survival. In multivariable analyses, an independent prognostic impact was found for FCR, thymidine kinase (TK) &gt;/=10 U/L, unmutated IGHV, 11q deletion, 17p deletion, TP53(mut), and SF3B1(mut) on progression-free survival; and for FCR, age &gt;/=65 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status &gt;/=1, beta2-microglobulin &gt;/=3.5 mg/L, TK &gt;/=10 U/L, unmutated IGHV, 17p deletion, and TP53(mut) on overall survival.

In conclusion, TP53 and SF3B1 mutations appear among the strongest prognostic markers in CLL patients receiving current-standard first-line therapy. NOTCH1(mut) was identified as a predictive marker for decreased benefit from the addition of rituximab to FC.

However, sequencing of trace amounts of DNA or RNA still remains a major challenge, especially for degraded nucleic acids like circulating DNA. This together with high cost and time requirements impedes many important applications of MPS in medicine and fundamental science. We have established a fast, cheap and highly efficient protocol called 'Capture and Amplification by Tailing and Switching' (CATS) to directly generate ready-to-sequence libraries for MPS from nanogram and picogram quantities of both DNA and RNA. Furthermore, those DNA libraries are strand-specific, can be prepared within 2-3 h and do not require preliminary sample amplification steps. To exemplify the capacity of the technique, we have generated and sequenced DNA libraries from hundred-picogram amounts of circulating nucleic acids isolated from human blood plasma, one nanogram of mRNA-enriched total RNA from cultured cells and few nanograms of bisulfite-converted DNA. The approach for DNA library preparation from minimal and fragmented input described here will find broad application in diverse research areas such as translational medicine including therapy monitoring, prediction, prognosis and early detection of various human disorders and will permit high-throughput DNA sequencing from previously inaccessible material such as minute forensic and archeological samples.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>11 (7), 817-828</Feld596><PubVol>11</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>817</StrtPage><EndPage>828</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Turchinovich A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Surowy H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Serva A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Zapatka M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Lichter P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Burwinkel B" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24922482</PMID><DOI>10.4161/rna.29304</DOI><KST>B060</KST><KST>C080</KST><KEYWORD>CIRCULATING TUMOR DNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>QUANTITIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METHYLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BREAST-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIBRARIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SINGLE CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSCRIPTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RNA-SEQ</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SEQUENCING DATA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53691</publishedID><Artikel>Surprising prenatal toxicity of epidermal lipoxygenase-3</Artikel><Journal>Placenta</Journal><ABSTr>Metabolites of the epidermal lipoxygenase-3 (eLOX-3) are involved in various metabolic pathways.

Thus, the observed prenatal toxicity of eLOX-3 could be due to a strong effect on placental development.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>35 (9), 776-779</Feld596><PubVol>35</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>776</StrtPage><EndPage>779</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Vierling F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Dick A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Wahlbuhl M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Krieg P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Henke C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Ruebner M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Schneider H" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25043671</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.placenta.2014.07.004</DOI><KST>F020</KST><KEYWORD>TROPHOBLAST</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PPAR-GAMMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>placenta</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIFFERENTIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MASH2</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53692</publishedID><Artikel>Reduced promoter methylation and increased expression of CSPG4 negatively influences survival of HNSCC patients</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Proteoglycans are often overexpressed in tumors and can be found on several normal and neoplastic stem cells. In this study, we analyzed in-depth the role of CSPG4 in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Analysis of CSPG4 in a homogeneous study sample of HPV-negative stage IVa HNSCCs revealed overexpression of protein and mRNA levels in a subgroup of HNSCC tumors and a significant association of high CSPG4 protein levels with poor survival. This could be validated in three publicly available microarray datasets. As a potential cause for upregulated CSPG4 expression, we identified DNA hypomethylation in a CpG-island of the promoter region. Accordingly, we found an inverse correlation of methylation and patient outcome. Finally, CSPG4 re-expression was achieved by demethylating treatment of highly methylated HNSCC cell lines establishing a direct link between methylation and CSPG4 expression. In conclusion, we identified CSPG4 as a novel biomarker in HNSCC on several biological levels and established a causative link between DNA methylation and CSPG4 protein and mRNA expression.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>135 (11), 2727-2734</Feld596><PubVol>135</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>2727</StrtPage><EndPage>2734</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Warta R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Herold-Mende C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Chaisaingmongkol J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Popanda O" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Mock A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Mogler C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Osswald F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Herpel E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Kustner S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Eckstein V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Plass C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Plinkert P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Schmezer P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Dyckhoff G" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24740185</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28906</DOI><KST>C010</KST><KEYWORD>ANTIBODY-BASED IMMUNOTHERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NG2 EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VITRO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MELANOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA methylation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SQUAMOUS-CELL CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEAD</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLIOBLASTOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHONDROITIN SULFATE PROTEOGLYCAN</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53693</publishedID><Artikel>Omalizumab (anti-IgE) therapy increases blood glucose levels in severe persistent allergic asthma patients with diabetes mellitus: 18 month follow-up</Artikel><Journal>Clinical Laboratory</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Therapeutic anti-IgE antibodies (Xolair, omalizumab) able to reduce free IgE levels and to block the binding of IgE to Fcepsilon RI without cross-linking IgE and triggering degranulation of IgE-sensitised cells have been developed. METHODS: We had two male patients of severe persistent allergic asthma with type-2 diabetes mellitus at the ages of 57 and 52 and who had suffered a side-effect of increased blood glucose level that caused a need for an extra insulin injection to control the hyperglycemia. Their asthma was not under control, frequent emergency department admissions lead us to use omalizumab treatment. Assessment of clinical changes and adverse effects were evaluated at each bimonthly patient visit including vital signs, full physical examination, details of any allergy incidents, total and specific IgE levels, serum ECP (eosinophilic cationic peptid) levels, pulmonary function test, exhaled nitric oxide concentrations, and asthma control test. RESULTS: Both patients were on week 42 - 45 of omalizumab treatment with a the dosage of 375 and 300 mg when they had the adverse reaction we reported here; they also had no other complaints. Blood levels of ECP and high sensitive CRP (hs-CRP) were decreased after starting the treatment of anti-IgE. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first time an association between omalizumab use and hyperglycemia has been documented. Every vial of Xolair (150 mg) contains 145.5 mg sucrose and it might increase the blood levels of glucose in diabetics. As a conclusion the prescribing information might have been revised based on post marketing surveillance data and reported such cases indicating that different side effects may occur beyond 2 hours of the injection.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>60 (9), 1561-1564</Feld596><PubVol>60</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>1561</StrtPage><EndPage>1564</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Yalcin,A.D., Gorczynski,R.M., Cilli,A., Strauss,L."

Accumulating evidence suggests that exosomes released from tumor cells may play an essential role in this process but the mechanisms are not fully understood. Here we review recent papers showing that exosomes trigger the release of cytokines/chemokines from immune cells. We suggest that this process will either result in the stimulation of anti-tumor immune reactions or in a systemic immunosuppression. The direction appears to be largely dependent on the duration of interactions between immune cells and exosomes leading to the accumulation of inflammatory factors, i.e. on the length of the exposure to these factors. We propose that a long-term interaction of the immune system with elevated levels of tumor exosomes contributes to the development of immunosuppression in cancer patients.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>28 (), 51-7</Feld596><PubVol>28</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>51</StrtPage><EndPage>7</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Altevogt P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Bretz NP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Ridinger J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Utikal J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Umansky V" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24769223</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.semcancer.2014.04.00</DOI><KST>G300</KST><KST>D015</KST><KEYWORD>T-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MEMBRANE-VESICLES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANTITUMOR IMMUNITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMMUNE-RESPONSES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUPPRESSOR-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>myeloid cells</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RELEASED MICROVESICLES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL-DERIVED-EXOSOMES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REJECTION ANTIGENS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LINKING INFLAMMATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53697</publishedID><Artikel>Impaired autophagy: a link between neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine</Journal><ABSTr>Protein misfolding, and subsequent aggregation have been proven as the leading cause of most known dementias. Many of these, in addition to neurodegeneration, show profound changes in behaviour and thinking, thus, psychiatric symptoms. On the basis of the observation that progressive myoclonic epilepsies and neurodegenerative diseases share some common features of neurodegeneration, we proposed autophagy as a possible common impairment in these diseases. Here, we argue along similar lines for some neuropsychiatric conditions, among them depression and schizophrenia. We propose that existing and new therapies for these seemingly different diseases could be augmented with drugs used for neurodegenerative or neuropsychiatric diseases, respectively, among them some which modulate or augment autophagy.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>18 (9), 1705-1711</Feld596><PubVol>18</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>1705</StrtPage><EndPage>1711</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Polajnar M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Zerovnik E" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25139375</PMID><DOI>10.1111/jcmm.12349</DOI><KST>L501</KST><KEYWORD>AMYLOID-BETA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGENITOR PROLIFERATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADULT BRAIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEIN AGGREGATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUNTINGTONS-DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL-DEATH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OXIDATIVE STRESS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOUSE MODEL</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53698</publishedID><Artikel>Outsmart tumor exosomes to steal the cancer initiating cell its niche</Artikel><Journal>Seminars in Cancer Biology</Journal><ABSTr>Exosomes are small vesicles that derive from endosomes and are delivered by many cells, including tumor cells that are a particular rich source of exosomes. Exosomes are suggested to be the most potent intercellular communicators. Being recovered in all body fluids, they can communicate with neighboring as well as distant cells. The latter was first described for dendritic cell exosomes that can initiate T cell activation. However, tumor exosomes (TEX) may impede this crosstalk. Besides with hematopoietic cells, TEX communicate with the tumor cell itself, but also with host stroma cells and endothelial cells. This crosstalk received much attention as there is strong evidence that TEX account for angiogenesis and premetastatic niche formation, which may proceed directly via binding and uptake of TEX by cells in the premetastatic organ or indirectly via TEX being taken up by hematopoietic progenitors in the bone marrow (BM), which mature toward lineages with immunosuppressive features or are forced toward premature release from the BM and homing into premetastatic organs. Knowing these deleterious activities of TEX, it becomes demanding to search for modes of therapeutic interference. I here introduce our hypothesis that metastasis formation may be hampered by tailored exosomes that outsmart TEX. The essential prerequisites are an in depth knowledge on TEX binding, uptake, binding-initiated signal transduction and uptake-promoted target cell reprogramming.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>28 (), 39-50</Feld596><PubVol>28</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>39</StrtPage><EndPage>50</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Thuma F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Zoeller M" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24631836</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.semcancer.2014.02.01</DOI><KST>V049</KST><KEYWORD>CARCINOMA-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>T-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTERCELLULAR COMMUNICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEAT-SHOCK PROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PREMETASTATIC NICHE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIAGNOSTIC BIOMARKERS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASCITES-DERIVED EXOSOMES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53699</publishedID><Artikel>Clinically relevant doses of FLT3-kinase inhibitors quizartinib and midostaurin do not impair T-cell reactivity and function</Artikel><Journal>Haematologica</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>99 (6), e90-e93</Feld596><PubVol>99</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>e90</StrtPage><EndPage>e93</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Wolleschak D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Mack TS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Perner F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Frey S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schnoder TM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Wagner MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Hoding C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Pils MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Parkner A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Kliche S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Schraven B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Hebel K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Brunner-Weinzierl M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Ranjan S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Isermann B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Lipka DB" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="16" name="Fischer T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Heidel FH" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24633870</PMID><DOI>10.3324/haematol.2014.104331</DOI><KST>C010</KST><KEYWORD>FLT3</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACUTE MYELOID-LEUKEMIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTERNAL TANDEM DUPLICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>proliferation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSPLANTATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>imatinib</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53700</publishedID><Artikel>Blood eosinophil and platelet levels, proteomics patterns of trail and CXCL8 correlated with survival in bevacizumab treated metastatic colon cancers</Artikel><Journal>Clinical Laboratory</Journal><ABSTr>STrail (soluble TNF-related apoptosis-inducing-ligand) has also been observed where the cytotoxic effects of antiangiogenic agents are increased in clinical phase II and III studies when these agents are combined with TRAIL related therapies. Recent studies have shown that CXCL8 and its receptors are significantly up-regulated in CRC and act as regulators of proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis. sTRAIL, CXCL8, CEA, together with complete blood count parameters (hemoglobine, platelet, eosinophil, basophil, neutrophil, lymphocyte) were recorded in the beginning and every three months afterwards for a period of 4 years. The study population comprised 21 of the 42 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC), undergoing 18 FDG-PET/CT scanning prior to treatment. Progression free survival was 262 days and overall survival was 1148 days. Overall survival was higher in patients whose Karnofsky Performance scores were above 86% (p = 0.003). Progression free survival was higher in patients whose blood eosinophil counts at 0, 6, and 9 months were higher than the mean levels of corresponding values (p-values are 0.016, 0.032, and 0.001, respectively). Another significant positive correlation was found between the platelet levels at 9 months and progression free survival (p = 0.019). There were significant changes (p &lt; 0.05) prior to treatment and three months later for sTRAIL (p = 0.0060) and CXCL8 (p = 0.00001), based on the Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test. Generally, sTRAIL values increased during therapy, while a decrease was observed for CXCL8 without any significant differences for other variables.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>60 (2), 339-340</Feld596><PubVol>60</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>339</StrtPage><EndPage>340</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Yalcin,A.D., Kargi,A., Gumuslu,S., Strauss,L.G."

Openly available and user friendly tools for the flexible generation of tailor-made datasets for the specific tasks at hand can greatly facilitate the work of researchers around the world.

MethodsWe present an open-source framework, Fiberfox, that enables (1) the intuitive definition of arbitrary artificial white matter fiber tracts, (2) signal generation from those fibers by means of the most recent multi-compartment modeling techniques, and (3) simulation of the actual MR acquisition that allows for the introduction of realistic MRI-related effects into the final image.

ResultsWe show that real acquisitions can be closely approximated by simulating the acquisition of the well-known FiberCup phantom. We further demonstrate the advantages of our framework by evaluating the effects of imaging artifacts and acquisition settings on the outcome of 12 tractography algorithms.

ConclusionOur findings suggest that experiments on a realistic software phantom might change the conclusions drawn from earlier hardware phantom experiments. Fiberfox may find application in validating and further developing methods such as tractography, super-resolution, diffusion modeling or artifact correction.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>72 (5), 1460-1470</Feld596><PubVol>72</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>1460</StrtPage><EndPage>1470</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Neher, P.F."

Using exome sequencing, here we show that analysis of rare coding variation in 3,871 autism cases and 9,937 ancestry-matched or parental controls implicates 22 autosomal genes at a false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.05, plus a set of 107 autosomal genes strongly enriched for those likely to affect risk (FDR &lt; 0.30). These 107 genes, which show unusual evolutionary constraint against mutations, incur de novo loss-of-function mutations in over 5% of autistic subjects. Many of the genes implicated encode proteins for synaptic formation, transcriptional regulation and chromatin-remodelling pathways. These include voltage-gated ion channels regulating the propagation of action potentials, pacemaking and excitability-transcription coupling, as well as histone-modifying enzymes and chromatin remodellers-most prominently those that mediate post-translational lysine methylation/demethylation modifications of histones.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>515 (7526),

of cellular cross-talk with Schwann cells</Artikel><Journal>Oncotarget</Journal><ABSTr>In neuroblastoma, the most common solid tumor of childhood, excellent prognosis is associated with extensive Schwann cell (SC) content and high-level expression of the neurotrophin receptor, NTRK1/TrkA, which is known to mediate neuroblastoma cell differentiation. We hypothesized that both stromal composition and neuroblastic differentiation are based on bidirectional neuroblastoma-SC interaction. Reanalysis of microarray data from human SY5Y neuroblastoma cells stably transfected with either NTRK1 or NTRK2 revealed upregulation of the mRNA for the SC growth factor, NRG1, in NTRK1-positive cells. Media conditioned by NTRK1-expressing neuroblastoma cells induced SC proliferation and migration, while antibody-based NRG1 neutralization significantly decreased these effects. Vice versa, NRG1-stimulated SC secreted the NTRK1-specific ligand, NGF. SC-conditioned medium activated the NTRK1 receptor in a neuroblastoma cell culture model conditionally expressing NTRK1 and induced differentiation markers in NTRK1-expressing cells. NTRK1 induction in neuroblastoma xenografts mixed with primary SC also significantly reduced tumor growth in vivo. We propose a model for NTRK1-mediated and NRG1-dependent attraction of adjacent SC, which in turn induce neuroblastic differentiation by secretion of the NTRK1-specific ligand, NGF. These findings have implications for understanding the mature and less malignant neuroblastoma phenotype associated with NTRK1 expression, and could assist the development of new therapeutic strategies for neuroblastoma differentiation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>5 (22), 11180-11192</Feld596><PubVol>5</PubVol><PubIss>22</PubIss><StrtPage>11180</StrtPage><EndPage>11192</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Pajtler KW" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Mahlow E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Odersky A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Lindner S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Stephan H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Bendix I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Eggert A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Schramm A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Schulte JH" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25361003</PMID><KST>B062</KST><KST>L401</KST><KEYWORD>DIFFERENTIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SYSTEM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VITRO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR-GROWTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NERVE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CULTURES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHOLOGY CLASSIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLIAL GROWTH-FACTORS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53801</publishedID><Artikel>SIBLINGs and SPARC families: Their emerging roles in pancreatic cancer</Artikel><Journal>World Journal of Gastroenterology</Journal><ABSTr>Pancreatic cancer has a considerably poor prognosis with a 5-year survival probability of less than 5% when all stages are combined. Pancreatic cancer is characterized by its dense stroma, which is involved in the critical interplay with the tumor cells throughout tumor progression and furthermore, creates a barrier restricting efficient penetration of therapeutics. Alterations in a large number of genes are reflected by a limited number of signaling pathways, which are potential targets. Understanding more about the molecular basis of this devastating cancer type regarding tumor microenvironment, distinct subpopulations of cells, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and inflammation will lead to the development of various targeted therapies for controlling tumor growth and metastasis. In this complex scenario of pancreatic cancer, especially members of the "small integrin binding ligand N-linked glycoproteins" (SIBLINGs) and "secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine" (SPARC) families have emerged due to their prominent roles in properties including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, adhesion, migration, angiogenesis, wound repair and regulation of extracellular matrix remodeling. SIBLINGs consist of five members, which include osteopontin (OPN), bone sialoprotein, dentin matrix protein 1, dentin sialophosphoprotein and matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein. The SPARC family of modular extracellular proteins is comprised of SPARC/osteonectin (ON) and SPARC-like 1 (hevin); secreted modular calcium binding proteins; testicans and follistatin-like protein. In this review, we especially focus on OPN and ON, elaborating on their special and growing importance in pancreatic cancer diagnosis and prognosis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>20 (40), 14747-14759</Feld596><PubVol>20</PubVol><PubIss>40</PubIss><StrtPage>14747</StrtPage><EndPage>14759</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kaleagasioglu F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Berger MR" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25356037</PMID><DOI>10.3748/wjg.v20.i40.14747</DOI><KST>G401</KST><KEYWORD>DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BONE SIALOPROTEIN-II</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MATRICELLULAR GLYCOPROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OSTEOPONTIN EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH-FACTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXTRACELLULAR-MATRIX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SIGNALING PATHWAYS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53815</publishedID><Artikel>Quantification of cytosolic interactions identifies Ede1 oligomers as key organizers of endocytosis</Artikel><Journal>Molecular Systems Biology</Journal><ABSTr>Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a highly conserved intracellular trafficking pathway that depends on dynamic protein-protein interactions between up to 60 different proteins. However, little is known about the spatio-temporal regulation of these interactions. Using fluorescence (cross)-correlation spectroscopy in yeast, we tested 41 previously reported interactions in vivo and found 16 to exist in the cytoplasm. These detected cytoplasmic interactions included the self-interaction of Ede1, homolog of mammalian Eps15. Ede1 is the crucial scaffold for the organization of the early stages of endocytosis. We show that oligomerization of Ede1 through its central coiled coil domain is necessary for its localization to the endocytic site and we link the oligomerization of Ede1 to its function in locally concentrating endocytic adaptors and organizing the endocytic machinery. Our study sheds light on the importance of the regulation of protein-protein interactions in the cytoplasm for the assembly of the endocytic machinery in vivo.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>10 (11), 756-</Feld596><PubVol>10</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>756</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Boeke D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Trautmann S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Meurer M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Wachsmuth M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Godlee C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Knop M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Kaksonen M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25366307</PMID><DOI>10.15252/msb.20145422</DOI><KST>A260</KST><KEYWORD>BUDDING YEAST</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEIN INTERACTIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PLASMA-MEMBRANE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ARP2/3 COMPLEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CLATHRIN-MEDIATED ENDOCYTOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COATED PITS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEGATIVE REGULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>fluorescence correlation spectroscopy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CORTICAL ACTIN CYTOSKELETON</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53818</publishedID><Artikel>Physics-based shape matching for intraoperative image guidance</Artikel><Journal>Medical Physics</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: Soft-tissue deformations can severely degrade the validity of preoperative planning data during computer assisted interventions. Intraoperative imaging such as stereo endoscopic, time-of-flight or, laser range scanner data can be used to compensate these movements. In this context, the intraoperative surface has to be matched to the preoperative model. The shape matching is especially challenging in the intraoperative setting due to noisy sensor data, only partially visible surfaces, ambiguous shape descriptors, and real-time requirements. METHODS: A novel physics-based shape matching (PBSM) approach to register intraoperatively acquired surface meshes to preoperative planning data is proposed. The key idea of the method is to describe the nonrigid registration process as an electrostatic-elastic problem, where an elastic body (preoperative model) that is electrically charged slides into an oppositely charged rigid shape (intraoperative surface). It is shown that the corresponding energy functional can be efficiently solved using the finite element (FE) method. It is also demonstrated how PBSM can be combined with rigid registration schemes for robust nonrigid registration of arbitrarily aligned surfaces. Furthermore, it is shown how the approach can be combined with landmark based methods and outline its application to image guidance in laparoscopic interventions. RESULTS: A profound analysis of the PBSM scheme based on in silico and phantom data is presented. Simulation studies on several liver models show that the approach is robust to the initial rigid registration and to parameter variations. The studies also reveal that the method achieves submillimeter registration accuracy (mean error between 0.32 and 0.46 mm). An unoptimized, single core implementation of the approach achieves near real-time performance (2 TPS, 7-19 s total registration time). It outperforms established methods in terms of speed and accuracy. Furthermore, it is shown that the method is able to accurately match partial surfaces. Finally, a phantom experiment demonstrates how the method can be combined with stereo endoscopic imaging to provide nonrigid registration during laparoscopic interventions. CONCLUSIONS: The PBSM approach for surface matching is fast, robust, and accurate. As the technique is based on a preoperative volumetric FE model, it naturally recovers the position of volumetric structures (e.g., tumors and vessels). It cannot only be used to recover soft-tissue deformations from intraoperative surface models but can also be combined with landmark data from volumetric imaging. In addition to applications in laparoscopic surgery, the method might prove useful in other areas that require soft-tissue registration from sparse intraoperative sensor data (e.g., radiation therapy).</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>41 (11), 111901-</Feld596><PubVol>41</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>111901</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Suwelack S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Rohl S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bodenstedt S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Reichard D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Dillmann R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Dos Santos T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Maier-Hein L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Wagner M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Wuenscher J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Kenngott H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Mueller BP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Speidel S" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25370634</PMID><DOI>10.1118/1.4896021</DOI><KST>E131</KST></row><row><publishedID>53824</publishedID><Artikel>Variation of Densitometry on Computed Tomography in COPD - Influence of Different Software Tools</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>OBJECTIVES: Quantitative multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) as a potential biomarker is increasingly used for severity assessment of emphysema in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Aim of this study was to evaluate the user-independent measurement variability between five different fully-automatic densitometry software tools. MATERIAL AND METHODS: MDCT and full-body plethysmography incl. forced expiratory volume in 1s and total lung capacity were available for 49 patients with advanced COPD (age = 64+/-9 years, forced expiratory volume in 1s = 31+/-6% predicted). Measurement variation regarding lung volume, emphysema volume, emphysema index, and mean lung density was evaluated for two scientific and three commercially available lung densitometry software tools designed to analyze MDCT from different scanner types. RESULTS: One scientific tool and one commercial tool failed to process most or all datasets, respectively, and were excluded. One scientific and another commercial tool analyzed 49, the remaining commercial tool 30 datasets. Lung volume, emphysema volume, emphysema index and mean lung density were significantly different amongst these three tools (p&lt;0.001). Limits of agreement for lung volume were [-0.195, -0.052l], [-0.305, -0.131l], and [-0.123, -0.052l] with correlation coefficients of r = 1.00 each. Limits of agreement for emphysema index were [-6.2, 2.9%], [-27.0, 16.9%], and [-25.5, 18.8%], with r = 0.79 to 0.98. Correlation of lung volume with total lung capacity was good to excellent (r = 0.77 to 0.91, p&lt;0.001), but segmented lung volume (6.7+/-1.3 - 6.8+/-1.3l) were significantly lower than total lung capacity (7.7+/-1.7l, p&lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Technical incompatibilities hindered evaluation of two of five tools. The remaining three showed significant measurement variation for emphysema, hampering quantitative MDCT as a biomarker in COPD. Follow-up studies should currently use identical software, and standardization efforts should encompass software as well.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (11), e112898-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>e112898</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Wielpuetz MO" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Bardarova D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Weinheimer O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kauczor HU" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Eichinger M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Jobst BJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Eberhardt R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Koenigkam-Santos M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Puderbach M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Heussel CP" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25386874</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0112898</DOI><KST>E010</KST></row><row><publishedID>53825</publishedID><Artikel>The E6AP Binding Pocket of the HPV16 E6 Oncoprotein Provides a Docking Site for a Small Inhibitory Peptide Unrelated to E6AP, Indicating Druggability of E6</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>The HPV E6 oncoprotein maintains the malignant phenotype of HPV-positive cancer cells and represents an attractive therapeutic target. E6 forms a complex with the cellular E6AP ubiquitin ligase, ultimately leading to p53 degradation. The recently elucidated x-ray structure of a HPV16 E6/E6AP complex showed that HPV16 E6 forms a distinct binding pocket for E6AP. This discovery raises the question whether the E6AP binding pocket is druggable, i. e. whether it provides a docking site for functional E6 inhibitors. To address these issues, we performed a detailed analysis of the HPV16 E6 interactions with two small peptides: (i) E6APpep, corresponding to the E6 binding domain of E6AP, and (ii) pep11**, a peptide that binds to HPV16 E6 and, in contrast to E6APpep, induces apoptosis, specifically in HPV16-positive cancer cells. Surface plasmon resonance, NMR chemical shift perturbation, and mammalian two-hybrid analyses coupled to mutagenesis indicate that E6APpep contacts HPV16 E6 amino acid residues within the E6AP pocket, both in vitro and intracellularly. Many of these amino acids were also important for binding to pep11**, suggesting that the binding sites for the two peptides on HPV16 E6 overlap. Yet, few E6 amino acids were differentially involved which may contribute to the higher binding affinity of pep11**. Data from the HPV16 E6/pep11** interaction allowed the rational design of single amino acid exchanges in HPV18 and HPV31 E6 that enabled their binding to pep11**. Taken together, these results suggest that E6 molecular surfaces mediating E6APpep binding can also accommodate pro-apoptotic peptides that belong to different sequence families. As proof of concept, this study provides the first experimental evidence that the E6AP binding pocket is druggable, opening new possibilities for rational, structure-based drug design.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (11), e112514-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>e112514</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Zanier K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Stutz C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kintscher S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Reinz E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Sehr P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Bulkescher J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Hoppe-Seyler K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Trave G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Hoppe-Seyler F" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25383876</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0112514</DOI><KST>F065</KST></row><row><publishedID>53826</publishedID><Artikel>Deformable 3D-2D registration for CT and its application to low dose tomographic fluoroscopy</Artikel><Journal>Physics in Medicine and Biology</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>59 (24), 7865-7887</Feld596><PubVol>59</PubVol><PubIss>24</PubIss><StrtPage>7865</StrtPage><EndPage>7887</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Flach, B."

In this study, we show that fractalkine receptor expression marks emigrating subpopulations of the NKT1, NKT2, and NKT17 sublineages in the thymus and peripheral organs of naive mice. Moreover, NKT1 sublineage cells can be subdivided into two subsets, namely NKT1a and NKT1b, which exhibit distinct developmental and tissue-specific distribution profiles. More specifically, development and trafficking of the NKT1a subset are selectively dependent upon lymphotoxin (LT)alpha1beta2-LTbeta receptor-dependent differentiation of thymic stroma, whereas the NKT1b, NKT2, and NKT17 sublineages are not. Furthermore, we identify a potential cellular source for LTalpha1beta2 during thymic organogenesis, marked by expression of IL-7Ralpha, which promotes differentiation of the NKT1a subset in a noncell-autonomous manner. Collectively, we propose a mechanism by which thymic differentiation and retention of the NKT1 sublineage are developmentally coupled to LTalpha1beta2-LTbeta receptor-dependent thymic organogenesis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>193 (12), 5960-5972</Feld596><PubVol>193</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>5960</StrtPage><EndPage>5972</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Drennan MB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Govindarajan S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="De Wilde K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schlenner SM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Ware C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Nedospasov S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Rodewald HR" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Elewaut D" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25381434</PMID><DOI>10.4049/jimmunol.1401601</DOI><KST>D110</KST></row><row><publishedID>53866</publishedID><Artikel>Highly Effective Treatment of Skull Base Chordoma With Carbon Ion Irradiation Using a Raster Scan Technique in 155 Patients: First Long-Term Results</Artikel><Journal>Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUNDThe current study was conducted to evaluate the long-term results of irradiation with carbon ions in a raster scanning technique in patients with skull base chordomas.

METHODSBetween 1998 and 2008, a total of 155 patients (76 men and 79 women) with a median age of 48 years (range, 15 years-85 years) were irradiated with carbon ions using a raster scan technique. The irradiation was performed at the Society for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany. The median total dose was 60 gray (relative biological effectiveness) at 3 gray (relative biological effectiveness) per fraction. The median boost planning target volume was 70 mL (range, 2 mL-294 mL). Local control (LC) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method, whereas long-term toxicity was evaluated via questionnaires.

RESULTSThe median follow-up was 72 months (range, 12 months-165 months). All patients had residual macroscopic tumors at the initiation of radiotherapy. The authors observed 55 local recurrences during follow-up, as well as systemic disease progression in 4 patients. The resulting 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year LC rates were 82%, 72%, and 54%, respectively, whereas the 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year OS rates were 95%, 85%, and 75%, respectively. Age &lt;48 years and a boost volume &gt;75 mL were associated with a significantly improved LC and OS. Primary treatment resulted in a significantly better OS probability. No higher late toxicity could be detected after carbon ion treatment.

CONCLUSIONSCarbon ion therapy appears to be a safe and effective treatment for patients with skull base chordoma, resulting in high LC and OS rates.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>120 (21), 3410-3417</Feld596><PubVol>120</PubVol><PubIss>21</PubIss><StrtPage>3410</StrtPage><EndPage>3417</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Uhl,M."

In this study, we introduce a new synthetic peptidemass calibration standard termed PAS-cal tailored forMALDI-MS based bottom-up proteomics. This standard consists of 30 peptides between 8 and 37 amino acids long and each constructed to contain repetitive sequences of Pro, Ala and Ser as well as one C-terminal arginine residue. MALDI spectra thus cover a mass range between 750 and 3200 m/z in MS mode and between 100 and 3200 m/z in MS/MSmode. Our results show that multipoint calibration of MS spectra using PAS-cal peptides compares well to current commercial reagents for protein identification by PMF. Calibration of tandem mass spectra from LC-MALDI experiments using the longest peptide, PAS-cal37, resulted in smaller fragment ion mass errors, more matching fragment ions and more protein and peptide identifications compared to commercial standards, making the PAS-cal standard generically useful for bottom-up proteomics.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>14 (21-22), 2427-2431</Feld596><PubVol>14</PubVol><PubIss>21-22</PubIss><StrtPage>2427</StrtPage><EndPage>2431</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Maier SK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Bashkueva K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Roesli C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Skerra A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kuster B" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25143245</PMID><DOI>10.1002/pmic.201400199</DOI><KST>A010</KST><KST>A014</KST><KEYWORD>IDENTIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TOF-MS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53955</publishedID><Artikel>Browning of white adipose tissue uncouples glucose uptake from insulin signaling</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>Presence of thermogenically active adipose tissue in adult humans has been inversely associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes. While it had been shown that insulin is crucial for the development of classical brown fat, its role in development and function of inducible brown-in-white (brite) adipose tissue is less clear. Here we show that insulin deficiency impaired differentiation of brite adipocytes. However, adrenergic stimulation almost fully induced the thermogenic program under these settings. Although brite differentiation of adipocytes as well as browning of white adipose tissue entailed substantially elevated glucose uptake by adipose tissue, the capacity of insulin to stimulate glucose uptake surprisingly was not higher in the brite state. Notably, in line with the insulin-independent stimulation of glucose uptake, our data revealed that brite recruitment results in induction of solute carrier family 2 (GLUT-1) expression in adipocytes and inguinal WAT. These results for the first time demonstrate that insulin signaling is neither essential for brite recruitment, nor is it improved in cells or tissues upon browning.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (10), e110428-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>e110428</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Moessenboeck K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Vegiopoulos A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Rose AJ" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Sijmonsma TP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Herzig S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Schafmeier T" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25313899</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0110428</DOI><KST>A170</KST><KST>A171</KST><KEYWORD>ADIPOCYTES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIET-INDUCED OBESITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>adipogenesis</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADULT HUMANS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSCRIPTIONAL REGULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FAT-CELL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THERMOGENESIS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>53983</publishedID><Artikel>Myeloid mineralocorticoid receptor deficiency inhibits aortic constriction-induced cardiac hypertrophy in mice</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) blockade has been shown to suppress cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling in animal models of pressure overload (POL).

Macrophage infiltration in the heart was inhibited and expression of inflammatory genes was decreased in MMRKO mice. In addition, aortic fibrosis and inflammation were attenuated in MMRKO mice. Taken together, our data indicated that MR deficiency in myeloid cells effectively attenuated aortic constriction-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis, as well as aortic fibrosis and inflammation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (10), e110950-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>e110950</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Li C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Zhang YY" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Frieler RA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Zheng XJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Zhang WC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Sun XN" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Yang QZ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Ma SM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Huang B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Berger S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Wang W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Wu Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Yu Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Duan SZ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Mortensen RM" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25354087</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0110950</DOI><KST>A992</KST></row><row><publishedID>53985</publishedID><Artikel>PRC2 loss amplifies Ras signaling in cancer</Artikel><Journal>Nature Genetics</Journal><ABSTr>The histone-modifying PRC2 complex has an ambiguous role in cancer, bearing both oncogenic and tumor-suppressive features depending on cell type.

The clinical efficacy of the ALK inhibitor, crizotinib, lags behind expectations for treating MYCN-amplified, ALK-mutant neuroblastoma, a deadly childhood cancer. In this issue of Science Signaling, Umapathy et al. identify the kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) as a central mediator that enables ALK to boost MYCN expression, and they show that inhibiting ERK5 in concert with ALK reduced neuroblastoma cell viability in vitro and in xenograft tumor models.

In the pathogenesis of human diseases, globosides play an important role as cellular receptors for Shiga toxins which are produced by certain strains of S. dysenteriae and E. coli. In order to elucidate the pathogenesis of Shiga toxin-associated kidney failure, we studied human kidney biopsies and animal models. Our work showed that in patients suffering from Shiga toxin-elicited kidney failure, no complement activation could be demonstrated by immunohistochemical analysis of kidney biopsies. Therefore, complement activation is unlikely to play a major role in mediating thrombotic microangiopathy on exposure to Shiga toxin. Moreover, analysis of the human biopsies and of a murine model of Shiga toxin-associated disease pinpointed acute tubular damage as an important and previously neglected contributor to acute kidney failure in patients infected with Shiga toxin-producing E. coli. Furthermore, globosides play a decisive role in the pathogenesis of Fabry disease which results from a decreased or absent activity of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-galactosidase A. The results on transgenic mice showed that in vital organs, such as the heart, kidneys and liver, it was possible to revert the phenotype of Fabry disease by eliminating the synthesis of globosides. This implicates that substrate reduction therapy through inhibition of globosides might represent a new therapeutic option for Fabry disease, all the more so as globosides seem to be dispensable.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596> (Suppl. 2), 271-276</Feld596><PubVol/><PubIss>Suppl. 2</PubIss><StrtPage>271</StrtPage><EndPage>276</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Porubsky S" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25348118</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00292-014-1992-1</DOI><KST>G130</KST></row><row><publishedID>54015</publishedID><Artikel>Distortion of the per-pixel signal in the Timepix detector observed in high energy carbon ion beams</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Instrumentation</Journal><ABSTr>Within the application of the pixelated semiconductor Timepix detector for ion beam therapy purposes, distortion and non-linearity in the spectrometric pixel response to high energy carbon ions were observed. In this contribution, these effects are studied in detail. A distinct correlation between the arrival time of a particle during the exposure time and the respective detector signal was found. The hypothesis to explain these findings by oscillations in the pixel electronics leading to a second rise of the preamplifier output above threshold is discussed. Depending on the particle arrival time, the distortions can result in an artificially increased counter value and consequently an enlarged detector signal in energy mode. The effect appears when the signal per-pixel is above approximately 1MeV, therefore becomig especially significant for measurements with heavy ions.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (), Art.

However, we observed that IFN gamma inhibits IEC proliferation despite sustained activation of Akt/beta-catenin signaling. Here we show that inhibition of Akt/beta-catenin-mediated cell proliferation by IFN gamma is associated with the formation of a protein complex containing phosphorylated beta-catenin 552 (p beta-cat552) and 14.3.3 zeta. Akt1 served as a bimodal switch that promotes or inhibits beta-catenin transactivation in response to IFN gamma stimulation. IFN gamma initially promotes beta-catenin transactivation through Akt-dependent C-terminal phosphorylation of beta-catenin to promote its association with 14.3.3 zeta. Augmented beta-catenin transactivation leads to increased Akt1 protein levels, and active Akt1 accumulates in the nucleus, where it phosphorylates 14.3.3 zeta to translocate 14.3.3 zeta/beta-catenin from the nucleus, thereby inhibiting beta-catenin transactivation and IEC proliferation. These results outline a dual function of Akt1 that suppresses IEC proliferation during intestinal inflammation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>25 (19), 2894-2904</Feld596><PubVol>25</PubVol><PubIss>19</PubIss><StrtPage>2894</StrtPage><EndPage>2904</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Nava,P."

The effect of weight change in middle adulthood is unclear. We investigated the association between weight change in middle adulthood (i.e., women aged 40-50 years) and the risk of breast cancer before and after the age of 50. We included female participants of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort, with information on anthropometric measures at recruitment and after a median follow-up of 4.3 years. Annual weight change was categorized using quintiles taking quintile 2 and 3 as the reference category (-0.44 to 0.36 kg/year). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to examine the association. 205,723 women were included and 4,663 incident breast cancer cases were diagnosed during a median follow-up of 7.5 years (from second weight assessment onward). High weight gain (Q5: 0.83-4.98 kg/year) was related to a slightly, but significantly higher breast cancer risk (HRQ5_versus_Q2/3 : 1.09, 95% CI: 1.01-1.18). The association was more pronounced for breast cancer diagnosed before or at age 50 (HRQ5_versus_Q2/3 : 1.37, 95% CI: 1.02-1.85). Weight loss was not associated with breast cancer risk. There was no evidence for heterogeneity by hormone receptor status. In conclusion, high weight gain in middle adulthood increases the risk of breast cancer. The association seems to be more pronounced for breast cancer diagnosed before or at age 50. Our results illustrate the importance of avoiding weight gain in middle adulthood.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>135 (12), 2887-2899</Feld596><PubVol>135</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>2887</StrtPage><EndPage>2899</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Emaus MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="van Gils CH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bakker MF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Bisschop CN" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Monninkhof EM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Travier N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Berentzen TL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Romieu I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Rinaldi S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Chajes V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Gunter MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Clavel-Chapelon F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Fagherazzi G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Mesrine S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Chang-Claude J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="18" name="Kaaks R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="19" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Aleksandrova K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Naska A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Orfanos P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Palli D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Agnoli C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Vineis P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Mattiello A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Braaten T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Borch KB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Lund E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Menendez V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Sanchez MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Navarro C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Barricarte A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Amiano P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Sund M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Andersson A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Borgquist S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Olsson A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Wareham N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Travis RC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="44" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="45" name="Peeters PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="46" name="May AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24771551</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28926</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>GAIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SIZE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BODY-MASS INDEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>exercise</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FAT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>UNITED-STATES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OBESITY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54022</publishedID><Artikel>TERT promoter mutation status as an independent prognostic factor in cutaneous melanoma</Artikel><Journal>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Recently, TERT promoter mutations were identified at high frequencies in cutaneous melanoma tumor samples and cell lines. The mutations were found to have a UV-signature and to lead to increased TERT gene expression. We analyzed a large cohort of melanoma patients for the presence and distribution of TERT promoter mutations and their association with clinico-pathological characteristics. METHODS: 410 melanoma tumor samples were analyzed by Sanger sequencing for the presence of TERT promoter mutations. An analysis of associations between mutation status and various clinical and pathologic variables was performed. RESULTS: TERT promoter mutations were identified in 154 (43%) of 362 successfully sequenced melanomas. Mutation frequencies varied between melanoma subtype, being most frequent in melanomas arising in nonacral skin (48%) and melanomas with occult primary (50%), and less frequent in mucosal (23%), and acral (19%) melanomas. Mutations carried a UV signature (C&gt;T or CC&gt;TT). The presence of TERT promoter mutations was associated with factors such as BRAF or NRAS mutation (P &lt; .001), histologic type (P = .002), and Breslow thickness (P &lt; .001). TERT promoter mutation was independently associated with poorer overall survival in patients with nonacral cutaneous melanomas (median survival 80 months vs 291 months for wild-type; hazard ratio corrected for other covariates 2.47; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.29 to 4.74; P = .006). CONCLUSIONS: UV-induced TERT promoter mutations are one of the most frequent genetic alterations in melanoma, with frequencies varying depending on melanoma subtype. In nonacral cutaneous melanomas, presence of TERT promoter mutations is independently associated with poor prognosis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>106 (9), -</Feld596><PubVol>106</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage/><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Griewank KG" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Murali R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Puig-Butille JA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schilling B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Livingstone E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Potrony M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Carrera C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Schimming T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Moeller I" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Schwamborn M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Sucker A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Hillen U" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Badenas C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Malvehy J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Zimmer L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Scherag A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Puig S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Schadendorf D" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25217772</PMID><DOI>10.1093/jnci/dju246</DOI><KST>G300</KST><KST>L401</KST><KEYWORD>FREQUENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SQUAMOUS-CELL CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SKIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BRAF</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENETIC ALTERATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TELOMERES</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54023</publishedID><Artikel>circlize Implements and enhances circular visualization in R</Artikel><Journal>Bioinformatics</Journal><ABSTr>SUMMARY: Circular layout is an efficient way for the visualization of huge amounts of genomic information.

The association of prediagnostic plasma concentrations and dietary consumption of carotenoids and vitamins A, C and E with the risk of colon and rectal cancer was examined in this case-control study, nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study. Plasma concentrations of carotenoids (alpha- and beta-carotene, canthaxanthin, beta-cryptoxanthin, lutein, lycopene, zeaxanthin) and vitamins A (retinol), C and E (alpha-, beta- and gamma- and delta-tocopherol) and dietary consumption of beta-carotene and vitamins A, C and E were determined in 898 colon cancer cases, 501 rectal cancer cases and 1,399 matched controls. Multivariable conditional logistic regression models were performed to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). An association was observed between higher prediagnostic plasma retinol concentration and a lower risk of colon cancer (IRR for highest quartile = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.46, 0.87, p for trend = 0.01), most notably proximal colon cancer (IRR for highest quartile = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.27, 0.77, p for trend = 0.01). Additionally, inverse associations for dietary beta-carotene and dietary vitamins C and E with (distal) colon cancer were observed. Although other associations were suggested, there seems little evidence for a role of these selected compounds in preventing CRC through their antioxidative properties.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>135 (12), 2930-2939</Feld596><PubVol>135</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>2930</StrtPage><EndPage>2939</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Leenders M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Leufkens AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Siersema PD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="van Duijnhoven FJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Vrieling A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hulshof PJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="van Gils CH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Roswall N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Kyro C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Boutron-Ruault MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Fagerhazzi G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Cadeau C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Kuehn T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="14" name="Johnson T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Aleksandrova K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Klinaki E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Androulidaki A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Palli D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Grioni S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Sacerdote C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Panico S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Bakker MF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Skeie G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Jakszyn P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Barricarte A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Maria Huerta J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Molina-Montes E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Arguelles M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Johansson I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Ljuslinder I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Key TJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Bradbury KE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Wareham NJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Ferrari P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Duarte-Salles T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Jenab M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Gunter MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Vergnaud AC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="44" name="Wark PA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="45" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24771392</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28938</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>SERUM ALPHA-TOCOPHEROL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPIC PROJECT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RETINOL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BIOMARKERS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COHORT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OXIDATIVE STRESS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>antioxidants</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEALTH</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54025</publishedID><Artikel>Effects of selective MMP-13 inhibition in squamous cell carcinoma depend on estrogen</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Matrix metalloproteinases like MMP-13 cleave and remodel the extracellular matrix and thereby play a crucial role in tumor progression in vivo. Using a highly selective inhibitor to block MMP-13 protein activity, we demonstrate a striking inhibitory effect on invasive tumor growth and vascularization in murine skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Therapy outcome critically depends on animal age in C57Bl/6 mice and was successful in old female but not in young female mice. Treatment success was recovered by ovariectomy in young and abolished by 17ss-estradiol supplementation in old mice, suggesting a hormone dependent inhibitor effect. Responsiveness of the tumorigenic keratinocytes BDVII and fibroblasts to 17ss-estradiol was confirmed in vitro, where MMP-13 inhibitor treatment led to a reduction of cell invasion and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release. This correlated well with a less invasive and vascularized tumor in treated mice in vivo. 17ss-estradiol supplementation also reduced invasion and VEGF release in vitro with no additional reduction on MMP-13 inhibitor treatment. This suggests that low 17ss-estradiol levels in old mice in vivo lead to enhanced MMP-13 levels and VEGF release, allowing a more effective inhibitor treatment compared to young mice. In our study, we present a strong link between lower estrogen levels in old female mice, an elevated MMP-13 level, which results in a more effective MMP-13 inhibitor treatment in fibroblasts and SCC cells in vitro and in vivo.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>135 (12), 2749-2759</Feld596><PubVol>135</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>2749</StrtPage><EndPage>2759</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Meides A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Gutschalk CM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Devel L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Beau F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Czarny B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hensler S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Neugebauer J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Dive V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Angel P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Mueller MM" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24676718</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28866</DOI><KST>A100</KST><KST>A101</KST><KEYWORD>PROGRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BREAST-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POOR-PROGNOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>tumor</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH-FACTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANGIOGENESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLLAGENASE-3 EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SKIN CARCINOMA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54026</publishedID><Artikel>Depletion of globosides and isoglobosides fully reverts the morphologic phenotype of Fabry disease</Artikel><Journal>Cell and Tissue Research</Journal><ABSTr>Fabry disease is a monogenic X-linked lysosomal storage disease caused by alpha-galactosidase A (alphaGalA) deficiency. Enzyme replacement therapy through administration of the missing alphaGalA is currently the only accepted therapeutic option. However, this treatment is connected to high costs, has ill-defined indication criteria and its efficacy is controversially discussed. Our aim was to explore the possibility of a novel targeted substrate reduction therapy for Fabry disease. Owing to the fact that alphaGalA-deficient humans and mice accumulate the same glycosphingolipids (i.e. globosides, galabiosylceramide and isoglobosides), alphaGalA-deficient mice were crossed with mice deficient in enzymes synthesizing these classes of glycosphingolipids (i.e. globotrihexosylceramide and isoglobotrihexosylceramide synthase, respectively). Functional heart and kidney tests were performed together with an extensive biochemical analysis of urine and serum in aged mice. Lysosomal storage was assessed by thin layer chromatography and electron microscopy. We showed that depletion of globosides was sufficient to fully abolish the storage of glycosphingolipids in heart, kidney and liver and was paralleled by a complete restoration of lysosomal morphology in these organs. In contrast, in dorsal root ganglia, a depletion of both globosides and isoglobosides was necessary to fully counteract the lysosomal storage. The deficiency in globosides and/or isoglobosides did not cause any adverse effects. We conclude that substrate reduction therapy through inhibition of the synthesis of globosides and isoglobosides represents a valuable therapeutic option for Fabry disease, all the more as globosides and isoglobosides seem to be dispensable.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>358 (1), 217-227</Feld596><PubVol>358</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>217</StrtPage><EndPage>227</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Porubsky S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Jennemann R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Lehmann L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Groene HJ" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24992926</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00441-014-1922-9</DOI><KST>G130</KST><KEYWORD>ENZYME REPLACEMENT THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALPHA-GALACTOSIDASE-A</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUBSTRATE REDUCTION THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TYPE-1 GAUCHER-DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLOBOTRIAOSYLCERAMIDE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ISOGLOBOTRIHEXOSYLCERAMIDE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DEFICIENT MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-TRANSFER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOUSE MODEL</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54027</publishedID><Artikel>Humidified microcontact printing of proteins: universal patterning of proteins on both low and high energy surfaces</Artikel><Journal>Langmuir</Journal><ABSTr>Microcontact printing (muCP) of proteins is widely used for biosensors and cell biology but is constrained to printing proteins adsorbed to a low free energy, hydrophobic surface to a high free energy, hydrophilic surface. This strongly limits muCP as harsh chemical treatments are required to form a high energy surface. Here, we introduce humidified muCP (HmuCP) of proteins which enables universal printing of protein on any smooth surface. We found that by flowing water in proximity to proteins adsorbed on a hydrophilized stamp, the water vapor diffusing through the stamp enables the printing of proteins on both low and high energy surfaces. Indeed, when proteins are printed using stamps with increasing spacing between water-filled microchannels, only proteins adjacent to the channels are transferred. The vapor transport through the stamp was modeled, and by comparing the humidity profiles with the protein patterns, 88% relative humidity in the stamp was identified as the threshold for HmuCP. The molecular forces occurring between PDMS, peptides, and glass during printing were modeled ab initio to confirm the critical role water plays in the transfer. Using HmuCP, we introduce straightforward protocols to pattern multiple proteins side-by-side down to nanometer resolution without the need for expensive mask aligners, but instead exploiting self-alignment effects derived from the stamp geometry. Finally, we introduce vascularized HmuCP stamps with embedded microchannels that allow printing proteins as arbitrary, large areas patterns with nanometer resolution. This work introduces the general concept of water-assisted muCP and opens new possibilities for "solvent-assisted" printing of proteins and of other nanoparticles.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>30 (40), 12002-12010</Feld596><PubVol>30</PubVol><PubIss>40</PubIss><StrtPage>12002</StrtPage><EndPage>12010</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ricoult SG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Sanati Nezhad A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Knapp-Mohammady M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kennedy TE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Juncker D" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25222734</PMID><DOI>10.1021/la502742r</DOI><KST>B070</KST><KEYWORD>CELL-ADHESION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WATER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ARRAYS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RESOLUTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOLECULES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BACTERIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GRADIENTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POLY(DIMETHYLSILOXANE)</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STAMPS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54028</publishedID><Artikel>Metastatic sites and survival in lung cancer</Artikel><Journal>Lung Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>OBJECTIVES: Population-based data on metastatic sites and survival in site-specific metastases are lacking for lung cancer and for any cancer because most cancer registries do not record metastases. This study uses a novel population-based approach to identify metastases from both death certificates and national inpatient data to describe metastatic pathways in lung cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 17,431 deceased lung cancer patients diagnosed 2002-2010 were identified from the nationwide Swedish Cancer Registry, which is based on compulsory reports. The influence of age at diagnosis, sex, and histological subtype on metastatic spread was investigated. Survival in metastatic lung cancer was assessed by histology and metastatic site. RESULTS: The most frequent metastatic sites were the nervous system, bone, liver, respiratory system, and adrenal gland. Liver (35%) and nervous system (47%) metastases were common in patients with metastases from small cell lung cancer, and bone (39%) and respiratory system (22%) metastases in adenocarcinoma. Women (43% vs. 35%) and younger patients had more metastases to the nervous system. Median survival after diagnosis was 13 months for non-metastatic and five months for metastatic lung cancer. In this novel data, liver metastases conferred the worst prognosis (three months), especially for large cell histology. Bone metastases also featured poor survival, whereas survival in respiratory and nervous system metastases was better. CONCLUSION: Metastatic sites and survival in metastatic lung cancer is influenced by sex, histological subtype, and age at diagnosis. Liver and bone metastases signal poor survival, compared with nervous system metastases.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>86 (1), 78-84</Feld596><PubVol>86</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>78</StrtPage><EndPage>84</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Riihimaeki M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Hemminki A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Fallah M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Thomsen H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Sundquist K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Sundquist J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Hemminki K" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25130083</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.lungcan.2014.07.020</DOI><KST>C050</KST><KEYWORD>distant metastases</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>bone metastasis</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AUTOPSY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>carcinoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DEATH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATTERNS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54029</publishedID><Artikel>Anthropometric measures and bladder cancer risk: A prospective study in the EPIC cohort</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Anthropometric measures have been related to risk of several cancers. For bladder cancer, however, evidence is sparse. Comparability of existing studies is hampered by use of different obesity-measures, inadequate control for smoking, and few female cases. This study examined associations between height, weight, waist and hip circumference, waist-hip ratio, waist-height ratio, body mass index (BMI), recalled weight at age 20 and bladder cancer, and investigated effect modification by age, tumor aggressiveness and smoking. The study was conducted in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort, in 390,878 participants. Associations were calculated using Cox Proportional Hazards Models. During follow-up, 1,391 bladder cancers (1,018 male; 373 female) occurred. Height was unrelated to bladder cancer in both genders. We found a small but significant positive association with weight [1.04 (1.01-1.07) per 5 kilo], BMI [1.05 (1.02-1.08) per 2 units], waist circumference [1.04 (1.01-1.08) per 5 cm], waist-hip ratio (1.07 (1.02-1.13) per 0.05 unit] and waist-height ratio [1.07 (1.01-1.13) per 0.05 unit] in men. Stratification by smoking status confined associations in men to former smokers. In never smokers, we found no significant associations, suggesting residual confounding by smoking. Results did not differ with tumor aggressiveness and age. Residual analyses on BMI/waist circumference showed a significantly higher disease risk with BMI in men (p = 0.01), but no association with waist circumference. In conclusion, in this large study, height was unrelated to bladder cancer, whereas overweight was associated with a slightly higher bladder cancer risk in men. This association may, however, be distorted by residual confounding by smoking.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>135 (12), 2918-2929</Feld596><PubVol>135</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>2918</StrtPage><EndPage>2929</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Roswall N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Freisling H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Ros M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Christensen J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Boutron-Ruault MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Severi G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Fagherazzi G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Chang-Claude J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Kaaks R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Steffen A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Arguelles M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Agudo A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Sanchez MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Chirlaque MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Barricarte Gurrea A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Amiano P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Wareham N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Bradbury KE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Papatesta HM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Trichopoulos D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Palli D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Pala V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Sacerdote C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Mattiello A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Peeters PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Ehrnstrom R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Brennan P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Ferrari P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Ljungberg B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Norat T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Gunter M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Halkjaer J" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24771290</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.28936</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>DOSE-RESPONSE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REPRODUCTIVE FACTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BODY-MASS INDEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OXFORD PARTICIPANTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TREND ANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SEX-HORMONES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SELF-REPORTED SMOKING</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXOGENOUS HORMONE USE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54030</publishedID><Artikel>Regional differences in the incidence of self-reported type 2 diabetes in Germany: results from five population-based studies in Germany (DIAB-CORE Consortium)</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Population-based data are paramount to investigate the long-term course of diabetes, for planning in healthcare and to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of primary prevention. We analysed regional differences in the incidence of self-reported type 2 diabetes mellitus in Germany. METHODS: Data of participants (baseline age 45-74 years) from five regional population-based studies conducted between 1997 and 2010 were included (mean follow-up 2.2-7.1 years). The incidence of self-reported type 2 diabetes mellitus at follow-up was compared. The incidence rates per 1000 person-years (95% CI) and the cumulative incidence (95% CI) from regional studies were directly standardised to the German population (31 December 2007) and weighted by inverse probability weights for losses to follow-up. RESULTS: Of 8787 participants, 521 (5.9%) developed type 2 diabetes mellitus corresponding to an incidence rate of 11.8/1000 person-years (95% CI 10.8 to 12.9). The regional incidence was highest in the East and lowest in the South of Germany with 16.9 (95% CI 13.3 to 21.8) vs 9.3 (95% CI 7.4 to 11.1)/1000 person-years, respectively. The incidence increased with age and was higher in men than in women. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of self-reported type 2 diabetes mellitus shows regional differences within Germany. Prevention measures need to consider sex-specific differences and probably can be more efficiently introduced toward those regions in need.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>68 (11), 1088-1095</Feld596><PubVol>68</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>1088</StrtPage><EndPage>1095</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schipf S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Ittermann T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Tamayo T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Holle R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schunk M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Maier W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Meisinger C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Thorand B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Kluttig A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Greiser KH" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Berger K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Mueller G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Moebus S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Slomiany U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Icks A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Rathmann W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Volzke H" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25073594</PMID><DOI>10.1136/jech-2014-203998</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>METABOLIC-SYNDROME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SOUTHERN GERMANY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MELLITUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ATHEROSCLEROSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INDIVIDUALS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLUCOSE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PREVALENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MORTALITY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54031</publishedID><Artikel>Detection of circulating tumor cells for prediction of recurrence after adjuvant chemoradiation in locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck</Artikel><Journal>Annals of Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: The prognostic role of persistence of circulating tumor cells (CTC) after upfront tumor surgery for outcome of adjuvant (chemo)radiation in locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (LASCCHN) was evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective study, peripheral blood samples from 144 patients with LASCCHN presenting after tumor resection for adjuvant treatment were analyzed for CTC. Their detection was correlated with tumor site, clinical risk factors, disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: CTC were detected in 42 of 144 patients (29%). CTC detection was higher in cases with nodal involvement and in carcinomas located at the tonsil or base of tongue but was not influenced by age, smoking history, T stage, extracapsular lymph node extension, surgical margins or the human papillomavirus status. Overall, the presence of CTC was not predictive for OS or DFS. However, while in oropharyngeal carcinomas (OPC, n = 63), the detection of CTC was associated per trend with improved DFS [CTC+ versus CTC- (% of patients without evidence of disease at 2 years): 100% versus 79%; log rank: P = 0.059]; the reverse was observed for carcinomas from other sites (non-OPC, n = 81; CTC+ versus CTC-: 29% versus 75%; P = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, CTC remained an independent prognostic marker for DFS [hazard ratio (HR) 4.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-10.9, P = 0.002] and OS (HR 2.7, 95% CI 1.2-6.3, P = 0.016) in non-OPC. CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of CTC in non-OPC should prove useful for identification of patients who benefit from treatment intensification. The basis for the good prognostic value of CTC in OPC has to be elucidated in future studies.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>25 (10), 2042-2047</Feld596><PubVol>25</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>2042</StrtPage><EndPage>2047</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Tinhofer I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Konschak R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Stromberger C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Raguse JD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Dreyer JH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Johrens K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Keilholz U" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Budach V" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25057171</PMID><DOI>10.1093/annonc/mdu271</DOI><KST>L201</KST><KEYWORD>INFECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>prognosis</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>T-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>radiotherapy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>chemotherapy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROSTATE-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BONE-MARROW</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METASTATIC BREAST-CANCER</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54062</publishedID><Artikel>Image quality and cancer visibility of T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the prostate at 7 Tesla</Artikel><Journal>European Radiology</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>24 (8), 1950-1958</Feld596><PubVol>24</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>1950</StrtPage><EndPage>1958</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Vos, E.K."

Despite advances in the characterization of genomic and epigenetic aberrations contributing to PCa, the etiology of PCa is still far from being understood. Research over the past decade demonstrated the role of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in deregulation of target genes mainly through epigenetic mechanisms. In PCa, evidence accumulated that hundreds of lncRNAs are dysregulated. Functional analyses revealed their contribution to prostate carcinogenesis by targeting relevant pathways and gene regulation mechanisms including PTEN/AKT and androgen receptor signaling as well as chromatin remodeling complexes. Here we summarize our current knowledge on the roles of lncRNAs in PCa and their potential use as biomarkers for aggressive PCa and as novel therapeutic targets.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>395 (11), 1275-1290</Feld596><PubVol>395</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>1275</StrtPage><EndPage>1290</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Weiss M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Plass C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Gerhaeuser C" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25153594</PMID><DOI>10.1515/hsz-2014-0201</DOI><KST>C010</KST><KEYWORD>ANDROGEN-RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>epigenetic regulation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MESSENGER-RNAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPITHELIAL-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LONG-NONCODING-RNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC TARGET</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOMIC ANALYSES REVEAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SWI/SNF COMPLEX</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54116</publishedID><Artikel>Rare variants of large effect in BRCA2 and CHEK2 affect risk of lung cancer</Artikel><Journal>Nature Genetics</Journal><ABSTr>We conducted imputation to the 1000 Genomes Project of four genome-wide association studies of lung cancer in populations of European ancestry (11,348 cases and 15,861 controls) and genotyped an additional 10,246 cases and 38,295 controls for follow-up. We identified large-effect genome-wide associations for squamous lung cancer with the rare variants BRCA2 p.Lys3326X (rs11571833, odds ratio (OR) = 2.47, P = 4.74 x 10(-20)) and CHEK2 p.Ile157Thr (rs17879961, OR = 0.38, P = 1.27 x 10(-13)). We also showed an association between common variation at 3q28 (TP63, rs13314271, OR = 1.13, P = 7.22 x 10(-10)) and lung adenocarcinoma that had been previously reported only in Asians. These findings provide further evidence for inherited genetic susceptibility to lung cancer and its biological basis. Additionally, our analysis demonstrates that imputation can identify rare disease-causing variants with substantive effects on cancer risk from preexisting genome-wide association study data.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>46 (7), 736-741</Feld596><PubVol>46</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>736</StrtPage><EndPage>741</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Wang Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="McKay JD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Rafnar T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Wang Z" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Timofeeva MN" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Broderick P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Zong X" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Laplana M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Wei Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Han Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Lloyd A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Delahaye-Sourdeix M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Chubb D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Gaborieau V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Wheeler W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Chatterjee N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Thorleifsson G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Sulem P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Liu G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Kaaks R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="20" name="Henrion M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Kinnersley B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Vallee M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="LeCalvez-Kelm F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Stevens VL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Gapstur SM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Chen WV" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Zaridze D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Szeszenia-Dabrowska N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Lissowska J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Rudnai P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Fabianova E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Mates D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Bencko V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Foretova L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Janout V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Krokan HE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Gabrielsen ME" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Skorpen F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Vatten L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Njolstad I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Chen C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Goodman G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Benhamou S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="44" name="Vooder T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="45" name="Valk K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="46" name="Nelis M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="47" name="Metspalu A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="48" name="Lener M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="49" name="Lubinski J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="50" name="Johansson M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="51" name="Vineis P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="52" name="Agudo A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="53" name="Clavel-Chapelon F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="54" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="55" name="Trichopoulos D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="56" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="57" name="Johansson M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="58" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="59" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="60" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="61" name="Lathrop M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="62" name="Scelo G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="63" name="Albanes D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="64" name="Caporaso NE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="65" name="Ye Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="66" name="Gu J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="67" name="Wu X" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="68" name="Spitz MR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="69" name="Dienemann H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="70" name="Rosenberger A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="71" name="Su L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="72" name="Matakidou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="73" name="Eisen T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="74" name="Stefansson K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="75" name="Risch A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="76" name="Chanock SJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="77" name="Christiani DC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="78" name="Hung RJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="79" name="Brennan P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="80" name="Landi MT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="81" name="Houlston RS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="82" name="Amos CI" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24880342</PMID><DOI>10.1038/ng.3002</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KST>C010</KST><KEYWORD>POLYMORPHIC STOP CODON</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMMON GENETIC-VARIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POPULATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA-DAMAGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>adenocarcinoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUSCEPTIBILITY LOCUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>carcinoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METAANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54122</publishedID><Artikel>Particle therapy for non-small cell lung tumors: where do we stand?

The biology of the four common pediatric brain tumors-namely medulloblastoma; ependymoma; high-grade glioma (HGG), including diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma; and low-grade glioma-is highlighted in this CCR Focus article. The discovery that medulloblastoma consists of four different subgroups, namely WNT, SHH, Group 3, and Group 4, each with distinct clinical and molecular features, has affected the treatment of children with medulloblastoma. Prospective studies have documented the efficacy of SMO inhibitors in a subgroup of patients with SHH medulloblastoma. Efforts are ongoing to develop specific therapies for each of the subgroups of medulloblastoma. Similar efforts are being pursued for ependymoma, HGG, and diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma where the disease outcome for the latter two tumors has not changed over the past three decades despite several prospective clinical trials. Developing and testing targeted therapies based on this new understanding remains a major challenge to the pediatric neuro-oncology community. The focus of this review is to summarize the rapidly evolving understanding of the common pediatric brain tumors based on genome-wide analysis. These novel insights will add impetus to translating these laboratory-based discoveries to newer therapies for children diagnosed with these tumors.

Antiangiogenic treatment likely achieves a beneficial impact through multiple mechanisms of action. Ultimately, however, alternative proangiogenic signal transduction pathways are activated, leading to the development of resistance, even in tumors that initially respond. The identification of biomarkers or imaging parameters to predict response and to herald resistance is of high priority. Despite promising phase II clinical trial results and patient benefit in terms of clinical improvement and longer progression-free survival, an overall survival benefit has not been demonstrated in four randomized phase III trials of bevacizumab or cilengitide in newly diagnosed glioblastoma or cediranib or enzastaurin in recurrent glioblastoma. However, future studies are warranted. Predictive markers may allow appropriate patient enrichment, combination with chemotherapy may ultimately prove successful in improving overall survival, and novel agents targeting multiple proangiogenic pathways may prove effective.

METHODS: In a unique public-private partnership, 13 sites with extensive experience in both the assessment and diagnosis of ASD embarked on an ambitious, 2-year program to collect samples for genetic and phenotypic research and begin analyses on these samples. The program was called The Autism Simplex Collection (TASC). TASC sample collection began in 2008 and was completed in 2010, and included nine sites from North America and four sites from Western Europe, as well as a centralized Data Coordinating Center. RESULTS: Over 1,700 trios are part of this collection, with DNA from transformed cells now available through the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic (ADOS-G) measures are available for all probands, as are standardized IQ measures, Vineland Adaptive Behavioral Scales (VABS), the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT), and physical measures (height, weight, and head circumference). At almost every site, additional phenotypic measures were collected, including the Broad Autism Phenotype Questionnaire (BAPQ) and Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R), as well as the non-word repetition scale, Communication Checklist (Children's or Adult), and Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC). Moreover, for nearly 1,000 trios, the Autism Genome Project Consortium (AGP) has carried out Illumina 1 M SNP genotyping and called copy number variation (CNV) in the samples, with data being made available through the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Whole exome sequencing (WES) has been carried out in over 500 probands, together with ancestry matched controls, and this data is also available through the NIH. Additional WES is being carried out by the Autism Sequencing Consortium (ASC), where the focus is on sequencing complete trios. ASC sequencing for the first 1,000 samples (all from whole-blood DNA) is complete and data will be released in 2014. Data is being made available through NIH databases (database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) and National Database for Autism Research (NDAR)) with DNA released in Dist 11.0. Primary funding for the collection, genotyping, sequencing and distribution of TASC samples was provided by Autism Speaks and the NIH, including the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and the National Human Genetics Research Institute (NHGRI). CONCLUSIONS: TASC represents an important sample set that leverages expert sites. Similar approaches, leveraging expert sites and ongoing studies, represent an important path towards further enhancing available ASD samples.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>5 (), 34-</Feld596><PubVol>5</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>34</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Buxbaum JD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Bolshakova N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Brownfeld JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Anney RJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Bender P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Bernier R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Cook EH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Coon H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Cuccaro M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Freitag CM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Hallmayer J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Geschwind D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Klauck SM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Nurnberger JI" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Oliveira G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Pinto D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Poustka F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Scherer SW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Shih A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Sutcliffe JS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Szatmari P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Vicente AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Vieland V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Gallagher L" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25392729</PMID><DOI>10.1186/2040-2392-5-34</DOI><KST>B050</KST><KST>B063</KST><KEYWORD>SPECTRUM DISORDERS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Copy number variation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DE-NOVO MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SCALE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INDIVIDUALS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IDENTIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>validation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMMUNICATION CHECKLIST</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54132</publishedID><Artikel>Sexual Differentiation of the Brain Requires Perinatal Kisspeptin-GnRH Neuron Signaling</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Neuroscience</Journal><ABSTr>Sex differences in brain function underlie robust differences between males and females in both normal and disease states. Although alternative mechanisms exist, sexual differentiation of the male mammalian brain is initiated predominantly by testosterone secreted by the testes during the perinatal period. Despite considerable advances in understanding how testosterone and its metabolite estradiol sexually differentiate the brain, little is known about the mechanism that generates the male-specific perinatal testosterone surge. In mice, we show that a male-specific activation of GnRH neurons occurs 0-2 h following birth and that this correlates with the male-specific surge of testosterone occurring up to 5 h after birth. The necessity of GnRH signaling for the sexually differentiating effects of the perinatal testosterone surge was demonstrated by the persistence of female-like brain characteristics in adult male, GnRH receptor knock-out mice. Kisspeptin neurons have recently been identified to be potent, direct activators of GnRH neurons. We demonstrate that a population of kisspeptin neurons appears in the preoptic area of only the male between E19 and P1. The importance of kisspeptin inputs to GnRH neurons for the process of sexual differentiation was demonstrated by the lack of a normal neonatal testosterone surge, and disordered brain sexual differentiation of male mice in which the kisspeptin receptor was deleted selectively from GnRH neurons. These observations demonstrate the necessity of perinatal GnRH signaling for driving brain sexual differentiation and indicate that kisspeptin inputs to GnRH neurons are essential for this process to occur.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>34 (46), 15297-15305</Feld596><PubVol>34</PubVol><PubIss>46</PubIss><StrtPage>15297</StrtPage><EndPage>15305</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Clarkson J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Busby ER" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kirilov M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schuetz G" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Sherwood NM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Herbison AE" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25392497</PMID><DOI>10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3061-14.2014</DOI><KST>A170</KST><KST>A992</KST></row><row><publishedID>54135</publishedID><Artikel>Foretinib is Effective Therapy for Metastatic Sonic Hedgehog Medulloblastoma</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Research</Journal><ABSTr>Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor, with metastases present at diagnosis conferring a poor prognosis. Mechanisms of dissemination are poorly understood and metastatic lesions are genetically divergent from the matched primary tumor. Effective and less toxic therapies that target both compartments have yet to be identified. Here we report that the analysis of several large non-overlapping cohorts of medulloblastoma patients reveal MET kinase as a marker of sonic hedgehog (SHH) driven medulloblastoma. Immunohistochemical analysis of phosphorylated, active MET kinase in an independent patient cohort confirmed its correlation with increased tumor relapse and poor survival, suggesting that SHH medulloblastoma patients may benefit from MET-targeted therapy. In support of this hypothesis, we found that the approved MET inhibitor foretinib could suppress MET activation, decrease tumor cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in SHH medulloblastomas in vitro and in vivo. Foretinib penetrated the blood-brain barrier and was effective in both the primary and metastatic tumor compartments. In established mouse xenograft or transgenic models of metastatic SHH medulloblastoma, foretinib administration reduced the growth of the primary tumor, decreased the incidence of metastases and increased host survival. Taken together, our results provide a strong rationale to clinically evaluate foretinib as an effective therapy for patients with SHH-driven medulloblastoma.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>75 (1), 134-146</Feld596><PubVol>75</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>134</StrtPage><EndPage>146</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Faria CC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Golbourn B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Dubuc AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Remke M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Diaz RJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Agnihotri S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Luck A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Sabha N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Olsen S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Wu X" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Garzia L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Ramaswamy V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Mack SC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Wang X" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Leadley M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Reynaud D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Ermini L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Post M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Northcott PA" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="19" name="Pfister SM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="20" name="Croul S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Kool M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="22" name="Korshunov A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="23" name="Smith CA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Taylor MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Rutka JT" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25391241</PMID><DOI>10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-13-3629</DOI><KST>G380</KST><KST>B062</KST><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATHWAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INHIBITION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MIGRATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEPATOCYTE GROWTH-FACTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENETIC PROFILES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PEDIATRIC MEDULLOBLASTOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>C-MET</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54151</publishedID><Artikel>MicroRNA Related Polymorphisms and Breast Cancer Risk</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>Genetic variations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in microRNAs (miRNA) or in the miRNA binding sites may affect the miRNA dependent gene expression regulation, which has been implicated in various cancers, including breast cancer, and may alter individual susceptibility to cancer. We investigated associations between miRNA related SNPs and breast cancer risk. First we evaluated 2,196 SNPs in a case-control study combining nine genome wide association studies (GWAS). Second, we further investigated 42 SNPs with suggestive evidence for association using 41,785 cases and 41,880 controls from 41 studies included in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). Combining the GWAS and BCAC data within a meta-analysis, we estimated main effects on breast cancer risk as well as risks for estrogen receptor (ER) and age defined subgroups. Five miRNA binding site SNPs associated significantly with breast cancer risk: rs1045494 (odds ratio (OR) 0.92; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.88-0.96), rs1052532 (OR 0.97; 95% CI: 0.95-0.99), rs10719 (OR 0.97; 95% CI: 0.94-0.99), rs4687554 (OR 0.97; 95% CI: 0.95-0.99, and rs3134615 (OR 1.03; 95% CI: 1.01-1.05) located in the 3' UTR of CASP8, HDDC3, DROSHA, MUSTN1, and MYCL1, respectively. DROSHA belongs to miRNA machinery genes and has a central role in initial miRNA processing. The remaining genes are involved in different molecular functions, including apoptosis and gene expression regulation. Further studies are warranted to elucidate whether the miRNA binding site SNPs are the causative variants for the observed risk effects.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (11),

Cervical Biopsy Specimens: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Interobserver Agreement</Artikel><Journal>American Journal of Clinical Pathology</Journal><ABSTr>OBJECTIVES: The interpretation of cervical biopsy specimens guides management of women with suspected cervical cancer precursors. However, morphologic evaluation is subjective and has low interobserver agreement. Addition of p16(INK4a) immunohistochemistry may improve interpretation. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published data on interobserver agreement of p16(INK4a) positivity using p16(INK4a) immunohistochemistry and of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (CIN2+) and CIN grade 3 (CIN3+) classification using H&amp;E morphology in conjunction with p16(INK4a) in comparison with H&amp;E morphology alone. RESULTS: The literature search revealed five eligible articles. The results show strong agreement of pathologists' interpretation of cervical biopsy specimens as p16(INK4a) positive or negative (pooled kappa = 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88-0.92) and significantly higher agreement for a CIN2+ diagnosis with H&amp;E morphology in conjunction with p16(INK4a) (kappa = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.67-0.79) compared with H&amp;E morphology alone (kappa = 0.41; 95% CI, 0.17-0.65). Also, a slightly higher agreement for CIN3+ can be observed (kappa = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.39-0.94 for H&amp;E morphology in conjunction with p16(INK4a) and kappa = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.44-0.78 for H&amp;E morphology alone), but this difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The published literature indicates improved interobserver agreement of the diagnosis of CIN2+ with the conjunctive use of H&amp;E morphology with p16(INK4a) immunohistochemistry compared with H&amp;E morphology alone.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>142 (6), 767-772</Feld596><PubVol>142</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>767</StrtPage><EndPage>772</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Reuschenbach M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Wentzensen N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Dijkstra MG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="von Knebel Doeberitz M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Arbyn M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25389329</PMID><DOI>10.1309/AJCP3TPHV4TRIZEK</DOI><KST>G105</KST></row><row><publishedID>54200</publishedID><Artikel>Plasma choline metabolites and colorectal cancer risk in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Research</Journal><ABSTr>Few studies have examined associations between plasma choline metabolites and risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Therefore, we investigated associations between plasma biomarkers of choline metabolism [choline, betaine, dimethylglycine and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO)] and CRC risk among postmenopausal women in a case-control study nested within the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study. We selected 835 matched case-control pairs, and cases were further stratified by tumor site (proximal, distal, or rectal) and stage (local/regional or metastatic). CRC was assessed by self-report and confirmed by medical records over the mean 5.2y of follow-up. Baseline plasma choline metabolites were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In multivariable-adjusted conditional logistic regression models, plasma choline tended to be positively associated with rectal cancer risk [OR (95% CI)highest vs. lowest quartile=2.44 (0.93-6.40);P-trend=0.08], while plasma betaine was inversely associated with CRC overall [0.68 (0.47-0.99);P-trend=0.01] and with local/regional tumors [0.64 (0.42-0.99);P-trend=0.009]. Notably, the plasma betaine:choline ratio was inversely associated with CRC overall [0.56 (0.39-0.82);P-trend=0.004] as well as with proximal [0.66 (0.41-1.06);P-trend=0.049], rectal [0.27 (0.10-0.78);P-trend=0.02] and local/regional [0.50 (0.33-0.76);P-trend=0.001] tumors. Finally, plasma TMAO, an oxidative derivative of choline produced by intestinal bacteria, was positively associated with rectal cancer [3.38 (1.25-9.16);P-trend=0.02] and with overall CRC risk among women with lower (vs. higher) plasma vitamin B12 levels (P-interaction=0.003). Collectively, these data suggest that alterations in choline metabolism, which may arise early in disease development, may be associated with higher risk of CRC. The positive association between plasma TMAO and CRC risk is consistent with an involvement of the gut microbiome in CRC pathogenesis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>74 (24), 7442-7452</Feld596><PubVol>74</PubVol><PubIss>24</PubIss><StrtPage>7442</StrtPage><EndPage>7452</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Bae S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Ulrich CM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Neuhouser ML" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Malysheva O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Bailey LB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Xiao L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Brown EC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Cushing-Haugen KL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Zheng Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Cheng TY" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Miller JW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Green R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Lane DS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Beresford SA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Caudill MA" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25336191</PMID><DOI>10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-1835</DOI><KST>G110</KST><KEYWORD>BIOMARKERS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA methylation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLON-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ATHEROSCLEROSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>nutrient</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FOLATE STATUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MALIGNANT-TRANSFORMATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHOSPHOLIPID-METABOLISM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GUT MICROBIOTA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54202</publishedID><Artikel>Pilot Walnut Intervention Study of Urolithin Bioavailability in Human Volunteers</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry</Journal><ABSTr>A pilot intervention study was conducted in human volunteers (n = 4) to establish the bioavailability of urolithins, which are the terminal end-products of ellagitannin metabolism by the gastrointestinal microflora. Biospecimens (blood, feces, and urine) along with urolithins purified therefrom were analyzed for their antioxidant capacity in a range of in vitro assays. Urolithin metabolites were identified and quantitated in the biospecimens by negative ion mode HPLC-ESI-MS analysis. The data in this pilot study show that the metabolism of ellagitannins in the four volunteers gave rise to a diverse profile and a highly variable concentration of urolithins in urine. The concentration of glucuronidated urolithins in blood and urine did not correlate with antioxidant capacity. However, the antioxidant capacity of urine, but not plasma biospecimens, was highly correlated with uric acid concentration. The antioxidant capacity of fecal extracts correlated positively with the concentration of urolithin D in both the DPPH and FRAP assays, but not in the ORAC assay, which was entirely consistent with the in vitro assays for pure urolithin D.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>62 (42), 10264-10273</Feld596><PubVol>62</PubVol><PubIss>42</PubIss><StrtPage>10264</StrtPage><EndPage>10273</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Pfundstein B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Haubner R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Wuertele G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Gehres N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Ulrich CM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Owen RW" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25275327</PMID><DOI>10.1021/jf5040652</DOI><KST>G110</KST><KEYWORD>POLYPHENOLIC COMPOUNDS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROSTATE-GLAND</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GUT MICROBIOTA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ELLAGIC ACID</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POMEGRANATE JUICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN PLASMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER GROWTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIPID-PEROXIDATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VITRO</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54203</publishedID><Artikel>Randomized, controlled trial of resistance training in breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant radiotherapy: results on cancer-related fatigue and quality of life</Artikel><Journal>Annals of Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Exercise has been reported to decrease cancer-related fatigue and to increase quality of life (QoL) in various breast cancer (BC) populations. However, studies investigating exercise during radiotherapy or resistance training are scarce. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial (BEST study) to assess the efficacy of 12-week resistance training on fatigue beyond possible psychosocial effects of a group-based intervention. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred sixty patients with BC stage 0-III were randomly assigned to a 12-week progressive resistance training (2 times/week) or a 12-week relaxation control (RC, 2 times/week). Both interventions were group-based. The primary end point fatigue was assessed with a 20-item multidimensional questionnaire, QoL with EORTC questionnaires. Statistical analyses were based on analysis of covariance models for the individual changes from baseline to week 13. RESULTS: Adherence to the intervention program as well as the completion rate (97%) for the primary outcome variable fatigue was high. In intention-to-treat analyses for the N = 155 patients, significant between-group mean differences (MD) favoring the exercise group (EX) were observed for general fatigue (P = 0.044), especially for the subscale physical fatigue [MD = -0.8; 95% confidence interval -1.5 to -0.2, P = 0.013], but not for affective (P = 0.91) or cognitive fatigue (P = 0.65). For QoL, significantly larger improvements regarding the role function (P = 0.035) and pain (P = 0.040) were noted among exercisers compared with RCs. Future perspective improved significantly stronger in the RC group compared with the EX group (P = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS: The 12-week resistance training program was a safe, feasible and efficacious strategy to improve cancer-related fatigue and components of QoL in BC patients during adjuvant radiotherapy. As exercise was compared with another group-based intervention, results indicate that resistance training effects on fatigue and QoL go beyond psychosocial benefits, and that the clinically relevant overall benefit of resistance exercise compared with usual care can be assumed to be higher.

The authors hypothesized that genetic variation in folate-metabolizing genes could play a role in interindividual variability. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the associations between genetic variants in folate-metabolizing genes and clinical outcomes among patients with rectal cancer treated with 5-FU. METHODS: The authors investigated 8 functionally significant polymorphisms in 6 genes (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase [MTHFR] [C677T, A1298C], SLC19A1 [G80A], SHMT1 [C1420T], dihydrofolate reductase [DHFR] [Del19bp], TS 1494del,and TSER) involved in folate metabolism in 745 patients with TNM stage II or III rectal cancer enrolled in a phase 3 adjuvant clinical trial of 3 regimens of 5-FU and radiotherapy (INT-0144 and SWOG 9304). RESULTS: There were no statistically significant associations noted between polymorphisms in any of the genes and overall survival, disease-free survival (DFS), and toxicity in the overall analyses. Nevertheless, there was a trend toward worse DFS among patients with the variant allele of MTHFR C677T compared with wild-type, particularly in treatment arm 2, in which patients with the MTHFR C677T TT genotype had worse overall survival (hazards ratio, 1.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-2.93 [P = .03]) and DFS (hazards ratio, 1.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-3.03 [P = .02]) compared with those with homozygous wild-type. In addition, there was a trend toward reduced hematological toxicity among patients with variants of SLC19A1 G80A in treatment arm 1 (P for trend, .06) and reduced esophagitis/stomatitis noted among patients with variants of TSER in treatment arm 3 (P for trend, .06). CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variability in folate-metabolizing enzymes was found to be associated only to a limited degree with clinical outcomes among patients with rectal cancer treated with 5-FU.

It is believed to affect cancer development and progression through several etiologic pathways, including increased levels of DNA adduct formation, increased angiogenesis, and altered antiapoptotic signaling. This review highlights the application of inflammatory biomarkers in epidemiologic studies and discusses the various cellular mediators of inflammation characterizing the innate immune system response to infection and chronic insult from environmental factors. Included is a review of six classes of inflammation-related biomarkers: cytokines/chemokines, immune-related effectors, acute-phase proteins, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, prostaglandins and cyclooxygenase-related factors, and mediators such as transcription factors and growth factors. For each of these biomarkers, we provide a brief overview of the etiologic role in the inflammation response and how they have been related to cancer etiology and progression within the literature. We provide a discussion of the common techniques available for quantification of each marker, including strengths, weaknesses, and potential pitfalls. Subsequently, we highlight a few under-studied measures to characterize the inflammatory response and their potential utility in epidemiologic studies of cancer. Finally, we suggest integrative methods for future studies to apply multifaceted approaches to examine the relationship between inflammatory markers and their roles in cancer development.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (9), 1729-1751</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>1729</StrtPage><EndPage>1751</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Brenner DR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Scherer D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Muir K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schildkraut J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Boffetta P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Spitz MR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Le Marchand L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Chan AT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Goode EL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Ulrich CM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Hung RJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24962838</PMID><DOI>10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-14-0064</DOI><KST>G110</KST><KEYWORD>pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OXIDATIVE DNA-DAMAGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TANDEM MASS-SPECTROMETRY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NONSTEROIDAL ANTIINFLAMMATORY DRUGS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>C-REACTIVE PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FACTOR-KAPPA-B</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL LUNG-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>URINARY 8-HYDROXY-2'-DEOXYGUANOSINE 8-OHDG</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INFILTRATING CD8(+) LYMPHOCYTES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROSTAGLANDIN E-2 METABOLITE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54209</publishedID><Artikel>Cardiorespiratory fitness in breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant therapy</Artikel><Journal>Acta Oncologica</Journal><ABSTr>Abstract Purpose. The aim of this work was to investigate cardiorespiratory fitness in breast cancer patients at different time points of anti-cancer treatment. Patients and methods. Non-metastatic breast cancer patients (n = 222, mean age 55 years) were categorized into four subgroups according to their treatment status. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) was used to measure patients' cardiorespiratory fitness, including oxygen delivery and metabolic muscle function. Testing was performed by bicycle ergometry, and maximal oxygen uptake (VO2peak) was measured. Heart rate during exercise at 50 watts (HR50) was assessed as a cardiocirculatory parameter and ventilatory threshold (VT) was used as an indicator of the O2 supply to muscle. Analysis of covariance was used to estimate the impact of different cancer treatments on cardiorespiratory fitness with adjustment for clinical factors. Results. Submaximal measures were successfully assessed in 220 (99%) and 200 (90%) patients for HR50 and VT, while criteria for maximal exercise testing were met by 176 patients (79%), respectively. The mean VO2peak was 20.6 +/- 6.7 ml/kg/min, mean VT 10.7 +/- 2.9 ml/min/kg and mean HR50 112 +/- 16 beats/min. Chemotherapy was significantly associated with decreased VO2peak, with significantly lower adjusted mean VO2peak among patients post adjuvant chemotherapy compared to patients with no chemotherapy or those who just started chemotherapy regime (all p &lt; 0.01). Patients post adjuvant chemotherapy reached only 63% of the VO2peak level expected for their age- and BMI-category (mean VO2peak 15.5 +/- 4.8 ml/kg/min). Similarly, HR50 was significantly associated with treatment. However, VT was not associated with treatment. Conclusion. Breast cancer patients have marked and significantly impaired cardiopulmonary function during and after chemotherapy. Hereby, chemotherapy appears to impair cardiorespiratory fitness by influencing the oxygen delivery system rather than impacting metabolic muscle function. Our findings underline the need of exercise training in breast cancer patients to counteract the loss of cardiorespiratory fitness during the anti-cancer treatment.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>53 (10), 1356-1365</Feld596><PubVol>53</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>1356</StrtPage><EndPage>1365</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Klassen O" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Schmidt ME" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Scharhag-Rosenberger F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Sorkin M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Ulrich CM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Schneeweiss A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Potthoff K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Steindorf K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Wiskemann J" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24837860</PMID><DOI>10.3109/0284186X.2014.899435</DOI><KST>G110</KST><KEYWORD>MAXIMAL OXYGEN-UPTAKE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGRESSIVE RESISTANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ONCOLOGY RESEARCH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MORTALITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WOMEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECOMMENDATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>rehabilitation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GAS-EXCHANGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>exercise</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54244</publishedID><Artikel>Early pregnancy sex steroids and maternal risk of epithelial ovarian cancer</Artikel><Journal>Endocrine-Related Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Well-established associations between reproductive characteristics and epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) support an involvement of sex steroid hormones in the etiology of EOC. Limited previous studies have evaluated circulating androgens and the risk of EOC, and estrogens and progesterone have been investigated in only one of the previous studies. Furthermore, there is little data on potential heterogeneity in the association between circulating hormones and EOC by histological subgroup. Therefore, we conducted a nested case-control study within the Finnish Maternity Cohort and the Northern Sweden Maternity Cohort to investigate the associations between circulating pre-diagnostic sex steroid concentrations and the histological subtypes of EOC. We identified 1052 EOC cases among cohort members diagnosed after recruitment (1975-2008) and before March 2011. Up to three controls were individually matched to each case (n=2694). Testosterone, androstenedione, 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), progesterone, estradiol (E2), and sex hormone-binding globulin levels were measured in serum samples collected during the last pregnancy before EOC diagnosis. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. Associations between hormones and EOC differed with respect to tumor histology and invasiveness. Sex steroid concentrations were not associated with invasive serous tumors; however, doubling of testosterone and 17-OHP concentration was associated with approximately 40% increased risk of borderline serous tumors. A doubling of androgen concentrations was associated with a 50% increased risk of mucinous tumors. The risk of endometrioid tumors increased with higher E2 concentrations (OR: 1.89 (1.20-2.98)). This large prospective study in pregnant women supports a role of sex steroid hormones in the etiology of EOC arising in the ovaries</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>21 (6), 831-844</Feld596><PubVol>21</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>831</StrtPage><EndPage>844</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schock, H."

The WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) is a tumor suppressor spanning the common chromosomal fragile site FRA16D. Here, we report a direct role of WWOX in DNA damage response (DDR) and DNA repair. We show that Wwox deficiency results in reduced activation of the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) checkpoint kinase, inefficient induction and maintenance of gamma-H2AX foci, and impaired DNA repair. Mechanistically, we show that, upon DNA damage, WWOX accumulates in the cell nucleus, where it interacts with ATM and enhances its activation. Nuclear accumulation of WWOX is regulated by its K63-linked ubiquitination at lysine residue 274, which is mediated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase ITCH. These findings identify a novel role for the tumor suppressor WWOX and show that loss of WWOX expression may drive genomic instability and provide an advantage for clonal expansion of neoplastic cells.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>111 (44), E4716-E4725</Feld596><PubVol>111</PubVol><PubIss>44</PubIss><StrtPage>E4716</StrtPage><EndPage>E4725</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Abu-Odeh M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Salah Z" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Herbel C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Hofmann TG" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Aqeilan RI" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25331887</PMID><DOI>10.1073/pnas.1409252111</DOI><KST>A210</KST><KEYWORD>GENOMIC INSTABILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANDIDATE TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DOMAIN-CONTAINING OXIDOREDUCTASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLULAR-RESPONSES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BREAST-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIGASE ITCH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONTAINING PROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REPLICATION STRESS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54270</publishedID><Artikel>Dosimetric consequences of intrafraction prostate motion in scanned ion beam radiotherapy</Artikel><Journal>Radiotherapy and Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Scanned-beam interplay with the intrafraction target motion may result in dose deterioration in particle therapy. The magnitude of this effect and the possibilities to mitigate it were investigated for carbon ion prostate treatments. METHODS AND MATERIALS: For 12 prostate cases, 9 carbon ion treatment plans were prepared using 3 scanned-beam settings (spot sizes of 6, 7 and 9 mm and, respectively, raster pitches of 2, 2 and 3 mm) for 3 planning margins (3, 6 and 9 mm). Plans were recomputed in presence of 5 intrafraction prostate motion scenarios with and without intra-beam motion compensation. RESULTS: For 6 mm margin and 7 mm spot, the median (max) CTV D(95%) change was -0.2 (-2.6) pp (percentual points) with pure drift motion, -3.8 (-6.0) pp and -2.8 (-3.1) pp in transient motion scenarios and -4.8 (-7.7) pp and -1.8 (-5.7) pp in mixed motion scenarios. No particular raster setting brought distinct advantage, while planning margin expansion showed statistically significant effects for drift-dominated scenarios. Intra-beam motion compensation yielded improved CTV coverage. CONCLUSION: Intrafraction prostate motion can lead to marked target coverage deterioration, dependent on individual motion patterns, which can be only partially avoided through planning-time countermeasures. Among possible delivery-time countermeasures, intra-beam motion compensation is capable of improving target coverage.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>112 (1), 100-105</Feld596><PubVol>112</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>100</StrtPage><EndPage>105</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ammazzalorso F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Graef S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Weber U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Wittig A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Engenhart-Cabillic R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Jelen U" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24833557</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.radonc.2014.03.022</DOI><KST>E040</KST><KEYWORD>INTERPLAY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OPTIMIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SYSTEM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACCURACY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RADIATION-THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PARAMETERS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOVING TARGETS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLAND</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>electromagnetic tracking</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54271</publishedID><Artikel>Concordance assessment between a multiplexed competitive Luminex immunoassay, a multiplexed IgG Luminex immunoassay, and a pseudovirion-based neutralization assay for detection of human papillomaviruse types 16 and 18</Artikel><Journal>Vaccine</Journal><ABSTr>There are two approved vaccines against anogenital human papillomaviruses (HPV) and a nine-valent vaccine is currently under development. Although there are several assays available to measure antibodies elicited by HPV vaccines, there is currently no global standard for HPV antibody assays. In the current study, antibody responses to HPV16 and HPV18 among young men and women vaccinated with a quadrivalent HPV6/11/16/18 (qHPV) vaccine were assessed using three assays: a competitive Luminex immunoassay (cLIA-4) which measures antibodies directed against a single neutralizing epitope, an immunoglobulin G Luminex immunoassay (IgG-9) which measures both neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies, and a pseudovirion-based neutralization assay (PBNA) which functionally measures the full spectra of neutralizing antibodies. To assess HPV16 and HPV18 responses, 648 and 623 serum samples, respectively, were selected from three prior clinical trials of the qHPV vaccine. For each HPV type, the functional relationship between pairs of assay methods was estimated using a linear statistical relationship model and Pearson correlation coefficients. For both HPV16 and HPV18, the agreement between the PBNA and IgG-9 (correlation coefficients of 0.95 and 0.93, respectively) was comparable to the agreement between the cLIA-4 and IgG-9 (correlation coefficients of 0.92 and 0.92, respectively). Of 478 and 399 post-dose 3 samples that tested positive in the cLIA-4, 100% and 98% also tested positive in the IgG-9 and PBNA. The proportion of cLIA-4 seronegative post-dose 3 samples that tested positive in both the IgG-9 and PBNA was 68% (19/28) for HPV16 and 58% (71/122) for HPV18. The data demonstrate the three assays are highly correlated and reflect the measurement of neutralizing antibody. This further verifies that the IgG-9 assay, which is used to assess the immune response to an investigational nine-valent vaccine, is similarly sensitive to the PBNA for the detection of HPV16 and HPV18 neutralizing antibodies.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>32 (44), 5880-5887</Feld596><PubVol>32</PubVol><PubIss>44</PubIss><StrtPage>5880</StrtPage><EndPage>5887</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Brown D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Mueller M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Sehr P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Pawlita M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Seitz H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Rubio I" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Antonello J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Radley D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Roberts C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Saah A" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25148777</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.08.004</DOI><KST>F020</KST><KST>F035</KST><KEYWORD>HUMAN SERA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPITOPES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>antibodies</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EFFICACY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VIRUS-LIKE PARTICLES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>QUADRIVALENT HPV VACCINE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54272</publishedID><Artikel>Genome-wide interaction study of smoking and bladder cancer risk</Artikel><Journal>Carcinogenesis</Journal><ABSTr>Bladder cancer is a complex disease with known environmental and genetic risk factors. We performed a genome-wide interaction study (GWAS) of smoking and bladder cancer risk based on primary scan data from 3002 cases and 4411 controls from the National Cancer Institute Bladder Cancer GWAS. Alternative methods were used to evaluate both additive and multiplicative interactions between individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and smoking exposure. SNPs with interaction P values &lt; 5 x 10(-) (5) were evaluated further in an independent dataset of 2422 bladder cancer cases and 5751 controls. We identified 10 SNPs that showed association in a consistent manner with the initial dataset and in the combined dataset, providing evidence of interaction with tobacco use. Further, two of these novel SNPs showed strong evidence of association with bladder cancer in tobacco use subgroups that approached genome-wide significance. Specifically, rs1711973 (FOXF2) on 6p25.3 was a susceptibility SNP for never smokers [combined odds ratio (OR) = 1.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.20-1.50, P value = 5.18 x 10(-) (7)]; and rs12216499 (RSPH3-TAGAP-EZR) on 6q25.3 was a susceptibility SNP for ever smokers (combined OR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.67-0.84, P value = 6.35 x 10(-) (7)). In our analysis of smoking and bladder cancer, the tests for multiplicative interaction seemed to more commonly identify susceptibility loci with associations in never smokers, whereas the additive interaction analysis identified more loci with associations among smokers-including the known smoking and NAT2 acetylation interaction. Our findings provide additional evidence of gene-environment interactions for tobacco and bladder cancer.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>35 (8), 1737-1744</Feld596><PubVol>35</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>1737</StrtPage><EndPage>1744</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Figueroa JD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Han SS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Garcia-Closas M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Baris D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Jacobs EJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Kogevinas M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Schwenn M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Malats N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Johnson A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Purdue MP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Caporaso N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Landi MT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Prokunina-Olsson L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Wang Z" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Hutchinson A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Burdette L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Wheeler W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Vineis P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Siddiq A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Cortessis VK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Kooperberg C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Cussenot O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Benhamou S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Prescott J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Porru S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Trichopoulos D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Ljungberg B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Clavel-Chapelon F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Krogh V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Dorronsoro M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Travis R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Brenan P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Chang-Claude J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="36" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Conti D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Gago-Dominguez M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Stern MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Pike MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Van Den Berg D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Yuan JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Hohensee C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="44" name="Rodabough R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="45" name="Cancel-Tassin G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="46" name="Roupret M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="47" name="Comperat E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="48" name="Chen C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="49" name="De Vivo I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="50" name="Giovannucci E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="51" name="Hunter DJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="52" name="Kraft P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="53" name="Lindstrom S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="54" name="Carta A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="55" name="Pavanello S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="56" name="Arici C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="57" name="Mastrangelo G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="58" name="Karagas MR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="59" name="Schned A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="60" name="Armenti KR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="61" name="Hosain GM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="62" name="Haiman CA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="63" name="Fraumeni JF Jr" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="64" name="Chanock SJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="65" name="Chatterjee N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="66" name="Rothman N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="67" name="Silverman DT" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24662972</PMID><DOI>10.1093/carcin/bgu064</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>NADH CYTOCHROME B(5)</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA-REPAIR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHENOTYPE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POLYMORPHISMS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONFERS SUSCEPTIBILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INDEPENDENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NAT2 SLOW ACETYLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GSTM1 NULL</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54273</publishedID><Artikel>CD30-positive lymphoproliferative disorder in a red tattoo: regional lymphomatoid papulosis type C or pseudolymphoma?</Artikel><Journal>British Journal of Dermatology</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>171 (3), 668-670</Feld596><PubVol>171</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>668</StrtPage><EndPage>670</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Haus G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Utikal J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Geraud C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Goerdt S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Leverkus M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24689991</PMID><DOI>10.1111/bjd.13024</DOI><KST>G300</KST><KEYWORD>lymphomatoid papulosis</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SKIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PSEUDOLYMPHOMA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54274</publishedID><Artikel>Phase II study of sorafenib in children with recurrent or progressive low-grade astrocytomas</Artikel><Journal>Neuro-Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway is thought to be the key driver of pediatric low-grade astrocytoma (PLGA) growth. Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor targeting BRAF, VEGFR, PDGFR, and c-kit. This multicenter phase II study was conducted to determine the response rate to sorafenib in patients with recurrent or progressive PLGA. METHODS: Key eligibility criteria included age &gt;/= 2 years, progressive PLGA evaluable on MRI, and at least one prior chemotherapy treatment. Sorafenib was administered twice daily at 200 mg/m(2)/dose (maximum of 400 mg/dose) in continuous 28-day cycles. MRI, including 3-dimensional volumetric tumor analysis, was performed every 12 weeks. BRAF molecular testing was performed on tumor tissue when available. RESULTS: Eleven patients, including 3 with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), were evaluable for response; 5 tested positive for BRAF duplication. Nine patients (82%) came off trial due to radiological tumor progression after 2 or 3 cycles, including 3 patients with confirmed BRAF duplication. Median time to progression was 2.8 months (95% CI, 2.1-31.0 months). Enrollment was terminated early due to this rapid and unexpectedly high progression rate. Tumor tissue obtained from 4 patients after termination of the study showed viable pilocytic or pilomyxoid astrocytoma. CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib produced unexpected and unprecedented acceleration of tumor growth in children with PLGA, irrespective of NF1 or tumor BRAF status. In vitro studies with sorafenib indicate that this effect is likely related to paradoxical ERK activation. Close monitoring for early tumor progression should be included in trials of novel agents that modulate signal transduction.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>16 (10), 1408-1416</Feld596><PubVol>16</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>1408</StrtPage><EndPage>1416</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Karajannis MA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Legault G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Fisher MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Milla SS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Cohen KJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Wisoff JH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Harter DH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Goldberg JD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Hochman T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Merkelson A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Bloom MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Sievert AJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Resnick AC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Dhall G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Jones DT" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Korshunov A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="16" name="Pfister SM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="17" name="Eberhart CG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Zagzag D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Allen JC" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24803676</PMID><DOI>10.1093/neuonc/nou059</DOI><KST>G380</KST><KST>B062</KST><KEYWORD>PARADOXICAL ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR PROGRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Pilocytic astrocytoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ONCOLOGY GROUP</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECEPTOR TYROSINE KINASES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RAF</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLIOMAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BRAF</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54275</publishedID><Artikel>Influence of smoking on disease severity and antimalarial therapy in cutaneous lupus erythematosus: analysis of 1002 patients from the EUSCLE database</Artikel><Journal>British Journal of Dermatology</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: In recent years it has been controversially discussed in the literature if smoking is associated with the activity of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and the efficacy of antimalarial agents. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the influence of smoking on disease severity and antimalarial treatment in patients with CLE using the Core Set Questionnaire of the European Society of Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (EUSCLE). METHODS: A total of 1002 patients (768 female, 234 male) with different CLE subtypes were included in this cross-sectional study, which was performed in 14 different countries. Smoking behaviour was assessed by the EUSCLE Core Set Questionnaire in 838 patients and statistically analysed using an SPSS database. The results were correlated with the Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI) and the efficacy of antimalarial treatment. RESULTS: A high percentage (87.2%) of the 499 patients with CLE, who have ever smoked, had already smoked at the date of their first diagnosis. Patients with intermittent CLE have ever smoked significantly more often than patients with subacute CLE (P &lt; 0.05) and chronic CLE (P &lt; 0.05). The total CLASI activity and damage score of patients with CLE was 6.6 +/- 7.1 and 2.6 +/- 4.3, respectively, and was higher in patients who have ever smoked than in nonsmokers. Antimalarial treatment was successful in 84.3% of cases, with a significantly higher efficacy in nonsmokers than in patients with CLE who have ever smoked (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This analysis of a multicentre study population of 838 patients with CLE assessed by the EUSCLE Core Set Questionnaire confirms that smoking negatively influences CLE disease severity and the efficacy of antimalarial treatment.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>171 (3), 571-579</Feld596><PubVol>171</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>571</StrtPage><EndPage>579</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kuhn A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Sigges J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Biazar C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Ruland V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Patsinakidis N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Landmann A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Amler S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Bonsmann G" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24673427</PMID><DOI>10.1111/bjd.13006</DOI><KST>D030</KST><KEYWORD>AREA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CIGARETTE-SMOKING</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INDEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>QUINACRINE ATABRINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CLASI</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMIDUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CORE SET QUESTIONNAIRE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OUTCOME INSTRUMENT</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54276</publishedID><Artikel>Comparative validation of single-shot optical techniques for laparoscopic 3-d surface reconstruction</Artikel><Journal>IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging</Journal><ABSTr>Intra-operative imaging techniques for obtaining the shape and morphology of soft-tissue surfaces in vivo are a key enabling technology for advanced surgical systems. Different optical techniques for 3-D surface reconstruction in laparoscopy have been proposed, however, so far no quantitative and comparative validation has been performed. Furthermore, robustness of the methods to clinically important factors like smoke or bleeding has not yet been assessed. To address these issues, we have formed a joint international initiative with the aim of validating different state-of-the-art passive and active reconstruction methods in a comparative manner. In this comprehensive in vitro study, we investigated reconstruction accuracy using different organs with various shape and texture and also tested reconstruction robustness with respect to a number of factors like the pose of the endoscope as well as the amount of blood or smoke present in the scene. The study suggests complementary advantages of the different techniques with respect to accuracy, robustness, point density, hardware complexity and computation time. While reconstruction accuracy under ideal conditions was generally high, robustness is a remaining issue to be addressed. Future work should include sensor fusion and in vivo validation studies in a specific clinical context. To trigger further research in surface reconstruction, stereoscopic data of the study will be made publically available at www.open-CAS.com upon publication of the paper.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>33 (10), 1913-1930</Feld596><PubVol>33</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>1913</StrtPage><EndPage>1930</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Maier-Hein L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Groch A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bartoli A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Bodenstedt S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Boissonnat G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Chang PL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Clancy NT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Elson DS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Haase S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Heim E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Hornegger J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Jannin P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Kenngott H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Kilgus T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="14" name="Mueller-Stich B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Oladokun D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Rohl S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Dos Santos TR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Schlemmer HP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="19" name="Seitel A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Speidel S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Wagner M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Stoyanov D" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24876109</PMID><DOI>10.1109/TMI.2014.2325607</DOI><KST>E010</KST><KST>E130</KST><KEYWORD>ENDOSCOPIC IMAGES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOTION TRACKING</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SYSTEM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REGISTRATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MINIMALLY INVASIVE SURGERY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54281</publishedID><Artikel>Multiple highly and moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinomas of the skin during vismodegib treatment of inoperable basal cell carcinoma</Artikel><Journal>British Journal of Dermatology</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>171 (2), 431-433</Feld596><PubVol>171</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>431</StrtPage><EndPage>433</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Orouji A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Goerdt S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Utikal J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Leverkus M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24446722</PMID><DOI>10.1111/bjd.12840</DOI><KST>G300</KST></row><row><publishedID>54282</publishedID><Artikel>HLA-DQB1 gene and pemphigus vulgaris in patients with Mid-East origin</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Dermatological Science</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>76 (2), 153-155</Feld596><PubVol>76</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>153</StrtPage><EndPage>155</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Orouji E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Tavakkol Afshari J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Schmieder A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Layegh P" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25240867</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.jdermsci.2014.08.006</DOI><KST>G300</KST><KEYWORD>LLELES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FOLIACEUS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54283</publishedID><Artikel>Secondary hematoma expansion in intracerebral hemorrhage during rivaroxaban therapy</Artikel><Journal>American Journal of Emergency Medicine</Journal><ABSTr>Hematoma size is a key prognostic parameter in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH); hence, secondary hematoma enlargement is an important event.

Here, we present a 76-year-old woman anticoagulated with rivaroxaban who presented with a computed tomography showing a right basal ganglia ICH with ventricular extension. Although prothrombin concentrate was administered to reverse anticoagulation, follow-up cranial computed tomography demonstrated secondary hematoma enlargement.

Results from a German feasibility study</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Public Health</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: In 2011, almost 20.0% of the population of Germany had a migration background. Studies on their health tend to have low participation rates. The aim of our study was to compare different sampling strategies and to test different approaches to recruit migrants for an epidemiological study. METHODS: Four recruitment centres of the German National Cohort recruited persons of Turkish origin and ethnic German immigrants from former Soviet Union countries. A register-based (random samples from residents' registration offices) and a community-orientated strategy were applied. Participants underwent a medical examination and self-completed a questionnaire. RESULTS: Used approaches: The community-orientated strategies comprised the acquisition of key persons from migrant networks to support the recruitment, invitation talks and distribution of study materials in migrant settings, etc. The identifying variables in the registry data were name, nationality or country of birth. All but one centres used bilingual study material and study staff. PARTICIPATION: When comparing the two strategies, the register-based participation rates ranged from 10.1 to 21.0% (n = 668 participants) and the community-oriented recruitment resulted in 722 participants. CONCLUSION: Register-based recruitment should use a combination of name, nationality and country of birth in order not to be limited to identifying persons with a foreign nationality. However, according to the study staff, the community-oriented approach involving key persons of the same cultural background leads to a better acceptance by the participants. Also, it covers a more heterogeneous group. Yet, it is time-consuming and needs considerably more staff. Further research should establish the effectiveness of a combination of both strategies.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>24 (5), 721-726</Feld596><PubVol>24</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>721</StrtPage><EndPage>726</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Reiss K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Dragano N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Ellert U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Fricke J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Greiser KH" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Keil T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Krist L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Moebus S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Pundt N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Schlaud M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Yesil-Jurgens R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Zeeb H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Zimmermann H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Razum O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Jockel KH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Becher H" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24872519</PMID><DOI>10.1093/eurpub/cku046</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>PARTICIPATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEALTH INTERVIEW</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54285</publishedID><Artikel>Molecular basis for the antiparasitic activity of a mercaptoacetamide derivative that inhibits histone deacetylase 8 (HDAC8) from the human pathogen schistosoma mansoni</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Molecular Biology</Journal><ABSTr>Schistosomiasis, caused by the parasitic flatworm Schistosoma mansoni and related species, is a tropical disease that affects over 200 million people worldwide. A new approach for targeting eukaryotic parasites is to tackle their dynamic epigenetic machinery that is necessary for the extensive phenotypic changes during the life cycle of the parasite. Recently, we identified S. mansoni histone deacetylase 8 (smHDAC8) as a potential target for antiparasitic therapy. Here, we present results on the investigations of a focused set of HDAC (histone deacetylase) inhibitors on smHDAC8. Besides several active hydroxamates, we identified a thiol-based inhibitor that inhibited smHDAC8 activity in the micromolar range with unexpected selectivity over the human isotype, which has not been observed so far. The crystal structure of smHDAC8 complexed with the thiol derivative revealed that the inhibitor is accommodated in the catalytic pocket, where it interacts with both the catalytic zinc ion and the essential catalytic tyrosine (Y341) residue via its mercaptoacetamide warhead. To our knowledge, this is the first complex crystal structure of any HDAC inhibited by a mercaptoacetamide inhibitor, and therefore, this finding offers a rationale for further improvement. Finally, an ester prodrug of the thiol HDAC inhibitor exhibited antiparasitic activity on cultured schistosomes in a dose-dependent manner.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>426 (20), 3442-3453</Feld596><PubVol>426</PubVol><PubIss>20</PubIss><StrtPage>3442</StrtPage><EndPage>3453</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Stolfa DA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Marek M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Lancelot J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Hauser AT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Walter A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Leproult E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Melesina J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Rumpf T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Wurtz JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Cavarelli J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Sippl W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Pierce RJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Romier C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Jung M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24657767</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.jmb.2014.03.007</DOI><KST>L601</KST><KEYWORD>PRAZIQUANTEL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FR901228</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANALOGS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEUROPROTECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DEPSIPEPTIDE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>APOPTOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SYSTEM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>validation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DESIGN</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54286</publishedID><Artikel>Rapid and highly efficient inducible cardiac gene knockout in adult mice using AAV-mediated expression of Cre recombinase</Artikel><Journal>Cardiovascular Research</Journal><ABSTr>AIMS: Inducible gene targeting in mice using the Cre/LoxP system has become a valuable tool to analyse the roles of specific genes in the adult heart. However, the commonly used Myh6-MerCreMer system requires time-consuming breeding schedules and is potentially associated with cardiac side effects, which may result in transient cardiac dysfunction. The aim of our study was to establish a rapid and simple system for cardiac gene inactivation in conditional knockout mice by gene transfer of a Cre recombinase gene using adeno-associated viral vectors of serotype 9 (AAV9). METHODS AND RESULTS: AAV9 vectors expressing Cre under the control of a human cardiac troponin T promoter (AAV-TnT-Cre) enabled a highly efficient Cre/LoxP switching in cardiomyocytes 2 weeks after injection into 5- to 6-week-old ROSA26-LacZ reporter mice. Recombination efficiency was at least as high as observed with the Myh6-MerCreMer system. No adverse side effects were detected upon application of AAV-TnT-Cre. As proof of principle, we studied AAV-TnT-Cre in a conditional knockout model (Srf-flex1 mice) to deplete the myocardium of the transcription factor serum response factor (SRF). Four weeks after AAV-TnT-Cre injection, a strong decrease in the cardiac expression of SRF mRNA and protein was observed. Furthermore, mice developed a severe cardiac dysfunction with increased interstitial fibrosis in accordance with the central role of SRF for the expression of contractile and calcium trafficking proteins in the heart. CONCLUSIONS: AAV9-mediated expression of Cre is a promising approach for rapid and efficient conditional cardiac gene knockout in adult mice.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>104 (1), 15-23</Feld596><PubVol>104</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>15</StrtPage><EndPage>23</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Werfel S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Jungmann A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Lehmann L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Ksienzyk J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Bekeredjian R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Kaya Z" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Leuchs B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Nordheim A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Backs J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Engelhardt S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Katus HA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Mueller OJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25082846</PMID><DOI>10.1093/cvr/cvu174</DOI><KST>F010</KST><KEYWORD>MOUSE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSGENIC MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUSCLE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSDUCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEART</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADENOASSOCIATED VIRUS VECTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SERUM RESPONSE FACTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TROPONIN-T-GENE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SYSTEMIC INJECTION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54287</publishedID><Artikel>Impact of raltegravir on HIV-1 RNA and DNA forms following initiation of antiretroviral therapy in treatment-naive patients</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy</Journal><ABSTr>OBJECTIVES: The rapid early-phase decay of plasma HIV-1 RNA during integrase inhibitor-based therapy is not fully understood. The accumulation of biologically active episomal HIV-1 cDNAs, following aborted integration, could contribute to antiviral potency in vivo. METHODS: This prospective, controlled clinical observation study explored raltegravir's impact on the dynamics of HIV-1 RNA in plasma, and concentrations of total HIV-1 cDNA, episomal 2-long terminal repeat (LTR) circles and HIV-1 integrants in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Individuals starting therapy with two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors plus either raltegravir (raltegravir group; n = 10 patients) or boosted protease inhibitor/non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (control group; n = 10 patients) were followed for 48 weeks. RESULTS: Suppression of HIV-1 RNA (&lt;50 copies/mL) was reached earlier (5/10 versus 0/10 at week 4; 8/10 versus 4/10 at week 12) on raltegravir. Significant total HIV-1 cDNA reductions in PBMC were reached by day 99 and persisted until day 330, with median factors of decrease of 7.2 and 8.9, respectively. Broad inter-individual variations, yet no treatment-associated differences, were noted for HIV-1 cDNA concentrations. Despite reductions in HIV-1 RNA ( approximately 3 log) and total HIV-1 cDNA ( approximately 1 log), concentrations of integrants and 2-LTR circles remained largely unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: These results extend the previously reported early benefit of raltegravir on the decline of plasma viraemia to treatment-naive patients. The modest treatment-associated, yet group-independent, decline in total HIV-1 cDNA load and the lack of significant changes in integrated and episomal HIV-1 cDNA suggest that most integrated DNA is archival and targeting of HIV reservoirs other than PBMC may underlie beneficial effects of raltegravir.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>69 (10), 2809-2818</Feld596><PubVol>69</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>2809</StrtPage><EndPage>2818</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Stephan C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Baldauf HM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Barry J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Giordano FA" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Bartholomae CC" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Haberl A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Bickel M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Schmidt M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Laufs S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Kaderali L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Keppler OT" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24962031</PMID><DOI>10.1093/jac/dku213</DOI><KST>G100</KST><KEYWORD>CO-FORMULATED ELVITEGRAVIR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DECAY CHARACTERISTICS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTEGRASE INHIBITOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTENSIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMBINATION THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONTROLLED-TRIAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INFECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DOUBLE-BLIND</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS TYPE-1</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54306</publishedID><Artikel>ERCC1-positive circulating tumor cells in the blood of ovarian cancer patients as a predictive biomarker for platinum resistance</Artikel><Journal>Clinical Chemistry</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Platinum resistance constitutes one of the most recognized clinical challenges for ovarian cancer. Notably, the detection of the primary tumor-based excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) protein by immunohistochemistry was recently shown to be inaccurate for the prediction of platinum resistance. On the basis of the previous finding that circulating tumor cells (CTC) in the blood of ovarian cancer patients are prognostically significant, and given our hypothesis that the negative prognostic impact of CTC may arise from a cellular phenotype associated with platinum resistance, we asked whether expression of the excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) gene in the form of the ERCC1 transcript in CTC may be a suitable blood-based biomarker for platinum resistance. METHODS: The presence of CTC was analyzed by immunomagnetic CTC enrichment (n = 143 patients) targeting the epithelial epitopes epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EPCAM) (also known as GA733-2) and mucin 1, cell surface associated (MUC1), followed by multiplex reverse-transcription PCR to detect the transcripts EPCAM, MUC1, and mucin 16, cell surface associated (MUC16) (also known as CA125), including ERCC1 transcripts in a separate approach. ERCC1 expression in primary tumors was comparatively assessed by immunohistochemistry, using the antibody 8F1. RESULTS: At primary diagnosis, the presence of CTC was observed in 14% of patients and constituted an independent predictor of overall survival (OS) (P = 0.041). ERCC1-positive CTC (ERCC1(+)CTC) were observed in 8% of patients and constituted an independent predictor, not only for OS but also for progression-free survival (PFS) (P = 0.026 and P = 0.009, respectively). More interestingly, we discovered the presence of ERCC1(+)CTC at primary diagnosis to be likewise an independent predictor of platinum resistance (P = 0.010), whereas ERCC1 expression in corresponding primary tumor tissue predicted neither platinum resistance nor prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of ERCC1(+)CTC can serve as a blood-based diagnostic biomarker for predicting platinum resistance at primary diagnosis of ovarian cancer.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>60 (10), 1282-1289</Feld596><PubVol>60</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>1282</StrtPage><EndPage>1289</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kuhlmann JD" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Wimberger P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bankfalvi A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Keller T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Scholer S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Aktas B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Buderath P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Hauch S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Otterbach F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Kimmig R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Kasimir-Bauer S" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25015375</PMID><DOI>10.1373/clinchem.2014.224808</DOI><KST>L301</KST><KEYWORD>MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>carcinoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LUNG-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGRESSION-FREE SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METASTATIC BREAST-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CISPLATIN RESISTANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA-REPAIR ENDONUCLEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ERCC1 EXPRESSION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54308</publishedID><Artikel>Fish Consumption and the Risk of Stroke</Artikel><Journal>Current Nutrition Reports</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>3 (), 94-101</Feld596><PubVol>3</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>94</StrtPage><EndPage>101</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kuehn, T."

In this longitudinal case-cohort study, we aimed to investigate the prospective associations between objectively measured individual plasma phospholipid SFAs and incident type 2 diabetes in EPIC-InterAct participants.

Methods The EPIC-InterAct case-cohort study includes 12 403 people with incident type 2 diabetes and a representative subcohort of 16 154 individuals who were selected from a cohort of 340 234 European participants with 3 . 99 million person-years of follow-up (the EPIC study). Incident type 2 diabetes was ascertained until Dec 31, 2007, by a review of several sources of evidence. Gas chromatography was used to measure the distribution of fatty acids in plasma phospholipids (mol%); samples from people with type 2 diabetes and subcohort participants were processed in a random order by centre, and laboratory staff were masked to participant characteristics. We estimated country-specific hazard ratios (HRs) for associations per SD of each SFA with incident type 2 diabetes using Prentice-weighted Cox regression, which is weighted for case-cohort sampling, and pooled our findings using random-effects meta-analysis.

Findings SFAs accounted for 46% of total plasma phospholipid fatty acids. In adjusted analyses, different individual SFAs were associated with incident type 2 diabetes in opposing directions. Even-chain SFAs that were measured (14: 0 [myristic acid], 16: 0 [palmitic acid], and 18: 0 [stearic acid]) were positively associated with incident type 2 diabetes (HR [95% CI] per SD difference: myristic acid 1.15 [95% CI 1.09-1.22], palmitic acid 1.26 [1.15-1.37], and stearic acid 1.06 [1.00-1.13]). By contrast, measured odd-chain SFAs (15: 0 [pentadecanoic acid] and 17: 0 [heptadecanoic acid]) were inversely associated with incident type 2 diabetes (HR [95% CI] per 1 SD difference: 0.79 [0.73-0.85] for pentadecanoic acid and 0.67 [0.63-0.71] for heptadecanoic acid), as were measured longer-chain SFAs (20: 0 [arachidic acid], 22:0 [behenic acid], 23:0 [tricosanoic acid], and 24:0 [lignoceric acid]), with HRs ranging from 0.72 to 0.81 (95% CIs ranging between 0.61 and 0.92). Our findings were robust to a range of sensitivity analyses.

Interpretation Different individual plasma phospholipid SFAs were associated with incident type 2 diabetes in opposite directions, which suggests that SFAs are not homogeneous in their effects. Our findings emphasise the importance of the recognition of subtypes of these fatty acids. An improved understanding of differences in sources of individual SFAs from dietary intake versus endogenous metabolism is needed.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>2 (10), 810-818</Feld596><PubVol>2</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>810</StrtPage><EndPage>818</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Forouhi, N.G."

However, whether the cellular source influences the function of such tumor-promoting factors remains an open question. Here, we examined the roles of the cathepsin Z (CtsZ) protease, which is provided by both cancer cells and macrophages in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in humans and mice. We found that tumor proliferation was exclusively regulated by cancer cell-intrinsic functions of CtsZ, whereas tumor invasion required contributions from both macrophages and cancer cells. Interestingly, several of the tumor-promoting functions of CtsZ were not dependent on its described catalytic activity but instead were mediated via the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif in the enzyme prodomain, which regulated interactions with integrins and the extracellular matrix. Together, these results underscore the complexity of interactions within the tumor microenvironment and indicate that cellular source can indeed impact molecular function.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>28 (19), 2134-2150</Feld596><PubVol>28</PubVol><PubIss>19</PubIss><StrtPage>2134</StrtPage><EndPage>2150</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Akkari L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Gocheva V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kester JC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Hunter KE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Quick ML" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Sevenich L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Wang HW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Peters C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Tang LH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Klimstra DS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Reinheckel T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Joyce JA" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25274726</PMID><DOI>10.1101/gad.249599.114</DOI><KST>L601</KST></row><row><publishedID>54438</publishedID><Artikel>Genetic variation in mitotic regulatory pathway genes is associated with breast tumor grade</Artikel><Journal>Human Molecular Genetics</Journal><ABSTr>Mitotic index is an important component of histologic grade and has an etiologic role in breast tumorigenesis. Several small candidate gene studies have reported associations between variation in mitotic genes and breast cancer risk. We measured associations between 2156 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 194 mitotic genes and breast cancer risk, overall and by histologic grade, in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) iCOGS study (n = 39 067 cases; n = 42 106 controls). SNPs in TACC2 [rs17550038: odds ratio (OR) = 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16-1.33, P = 4.2 x 10(-10)) and EIF3H (rs799890: OR = 1.07, 95% CI 1.04-1.11, P = 8.7 x 10(-6)) were significantly associated with risk of low-grade breast cancer. The TACC2 signal was retained (rs17550038: OR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.07-1.23, P = 7.9 x 10(-5)) after adjustment for breast cancer risk SNPs in the nearby FGFR2 gene, suggesting that TACC2 is a novel, independent genome-wide significant genetic risk locus for low-grade breast cancer. While no SNPs were individually associated with high-grade disease, a pathway-level gene set analysis showed that variation across the 194 mitotic genes was associated with high-grade breast cancer risk (P = 2.1 x 10(-3)).

Beginning in 2014, a total of 200,000 women and men aged 20-69 years will be examined in 18 study centers. The aim of the study is to investigate the etiology of chronic diseases in relation to lifestyle, genetic, socioeconomic, and environmental factors and to develop appropriate methods for early diagnosis and prevention of diseases such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative/psychiatric diseases, as well as musculoskeletal and infectious diseases. Pretest studies (phase 1 and 2) were conducted to select methods, instruments, and procedures for the main study, to develop standard operating procedures, and to design and test the examination program according to acceptance, expected duration, and feasibility. The pretest studies included testing of interviews, questionnaires, anthropometric measurements, several medical examinations, and the collection of biosamples. In addition, the logistic, technical, and personnel infrastructure for the main study could be established including the study centers, the central infrastructure for data management, processes to coordinate the study, and data protection and quality management concepts. The examination program for the main phase of the GNC was designed and optimized based on the results of the pretest studies. The GNC is a population-based, highly standardized and excellently phenotyped cohort that will be the basis for new strategies for risk assessment and identification, early diagnosis, and prevention of multifactorial diseases.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>57 (11), 1246-1254</Feld596><PubVol>57</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>1246</StrtPage><EndPage>1254</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ahrens, W."

Materials and Methods: Twelve patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma were examined with ToF angiography (TR=15 ms, TE=4.8 ms, flip angle=15 degrees, FOV=160x210 mm(2), voxel size: 0.31x0.31x0.40 mm(3)) on a whole-body 7 T MR system. A volume of interest (VOI) was placed within the border of the contrast enhancing part on T1-weighted images of the glioblastoma and a reference VOI was placed in the non-affected contralateral white matter. Automated segmentation and quantification of vessels within the two VOIs was achieved using multiscale vessel enhancement filtering in ImageJ.

Results: Tumor vessels were clearly visible in all patients. When comparing tumor and the reference VOI, total vessel surface (45.3+/-13.9 mm2 vs. 29.0+/- 21.0 mm(2) (p&lt;0.035)) and number of branches (3.5+/- 1.8 vs. 1.0+/- 0.6 (p, 0.001) per cubic centimeter were significantly higher, while mean vessel branch length was significantly lower (3.8+/- 1.5 mm vs 7.2+/- 2.8 mm (p, 0.001)) in the tumor.

Discussion: ToF angiography at 7-Tesla MRI enables characterization and quantification of the internal vascular morphology of glioblastoma and may be used for the evaluation of therapy response within future studies.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (11), e110727-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>e110727</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Radbruch,A."

The present study therefore evaluated the role of BK in osteoblast lineage commitment. Our data showed that BK inhibits the migration of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, but does not affect their viability. Moreover, BK also inhibits osteoblastic differentiation by significantly downregulating the levels of mRNAs for osteopontin, runX2, col24, osterix, osteocalcin genes and bone mineralization (P &lt; 0.05). Further, BK was found to elicit the BK receptors (BDKR1 and BDKR2) mediated activation of ERK1/2 and Akt pathways, which finally led to the activation of NFkappaB. BK also promoted the osteoclast differentiation of bone marrow derived preosteoclast cells by upregulating the expression of c-fos, NFATC1, TRAP, clcn7, cathK, and OSCAR genes and increasing TRAP activity through NFkappaB pathway. In conclusion, our data suggest that BK decreases the differentiation of osteoblasts with concomitant increase in osteoclast formation and thus provides new insight into the mechanism of action of BK in modulating bone resorption.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>229 (12), 2088-2105</Feld596><PubVol>229</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>2088</StrtPage><EndPage>2105</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Srivastava S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Sharma K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kumar N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Roy P" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24825463</PMID><DOI>10.1002/jcp.24668</DOI><KST>B050</KST></row><row><publishedID>54565</publishedID><Artikel>miR-21-3p is a positive regulator of L1CAM in several human carcinomas</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Letters</Journal><ABSTr>Expression of L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) occurs frequently in human cancers and is associated with poor prognosis in cancers such as ovarian, endometrial, breast, renal cell carcinoma and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. L1CAM promotes cell motility, invasion, chemoresistance and metastasis formation. Elucidating genetic processes involved in the expression of L1CAM in cancers is of considerable importance. Transcription factors such as SLUG, beta-catenin/TCF-LEF, PAX8 and VHL have been implicated in the re-activation of L1CAM in various types of cancers. There is increasing evidence that micro-RNAs can also have strong effects on gene expression. Here we have identified miR-21-3p as a positive regulator of L1CAM expression. Over-expression of miR-21-3p (miR-21*) but not the complementary sequence miR-21-5p (miR-21) could strongly augment L1CAM expression in renal, endometrial and ovarian carcinoma derived cell lines by an unknown mechanism involving transcriptional activation of the L1CAM gene. In patient cohorts from renal, endometrial and ovarian cancers we observed a strong positive correlation of L1CAM and miR-21-3p expressions. Although L1CAM alone was a reliable marker for overall and disease free survival, the combination of L1CAM and miR-21-3p expressions strongly enhanced the predictive power. Our findings shed new light on the complex regulation of L1CAM in cancers and advocate the use of L1CAM/miR-21-3p for diagnostic application.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>354 (2), 455-466</Feld596><PubVol>354</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>455</StrtPage><EndPage>466</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Doberstein K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Bretz NP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Schirmer U" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Fiegl H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Blaheta R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Breunig C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Muller-Holzner E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Reimer D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Zeimet AG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Altevogt P" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25149066</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.canlet.2014.08.020</DOI><KST>B050</KST><KST>D015</KST><KST>B063</KST><KEYWORD>CELL-ADHESION MOLECULE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>UP-REGULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OVARIAN-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>KAPPA-B ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>L1 EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>endometrial carcinoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>L1-CAM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54566</publishedID><Artikel>Phenotypical and molecular distinctness of sinonasal haemangiopericytoma compared to solitary fibrous tumour of the sinonasal tract</Artikel><Journal>Histopathology</Journal><ABSTr>AIMS: Sinonasal haemangiopericytoma (SN-HPC) is a rare sinonasal mesenchymal neoplasm of perivascular myoid cell origin. Solitary fibrous tumour (SFT) occurs only very rarely in the sinonasal tract. SFT and soft tissue HPC have been considered a single entity. Recently, recurrent gene fusions involving NAB2-STAT6 resulting in differential expression of STAT6 were characterized as central molecular events in SFT. However, no data exist for NAB2-STAT6 status or STAT6 expression in SN-HPC. METHODS AND RESULTS: We examined six SN-HPCs and two sinonasal SFTs by immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR for NAB2-STAT6 fusions. SN-HPC affected three females and three males (mean age: 72 years). They expressed smooth muscle actin, lacked strong CD34 reactivity and were negative for nuclear STAT6 expression. RT-PCR analysis confirmed the absence of NAB2-STAT6 fusions in all cases. Conversely, both sinonasal SFTs (in males aged 39 and 52 years) displayed classical features of pleuropulmonary and soft-tissue SFTs (uniformly CD34-positive with strong nuclear expression of STAT6). RT-PCR revealed NAB2-STAT6 fusions in both cases. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm the molecular and phenotypical distinctness of these two entities. While SN-HPC is a site-specific sinonasal neoplasm of as yet unknown molecular pathogenesis, sinonasal SFTs show phenotypical and molecular identity to their pleural/extrapleural counterparts.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>65 (5), 667-673</Feld596><PubVol>65</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>667</StrtPage><EndPage>673</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Agaimy A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Barthelmess S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Geddert H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Boltze C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Moskalev EA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Koch M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Wiemann S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Hartmann A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Haller F" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24807787</PMID><DOI>10.1111/his.12452</DOI><KST>B050</KST><KEYWORD>CAVITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PATTERN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FUSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54567</publishedID><Artikel>De novo and rare inherited mutations implicate the transcriptional coregulator TCF20/SPBP in autism spectrum disorder</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Medical Genetics</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are common and have a strong genetic basis, yet the cause of approximately 70-80% ASDs remains unknown. By clinical cytogenetic testing, we identified a family in which two brothers had ASD, mild intellectual disability and a chromosome 22 pericentric inversion, not detected in either parent, indicating de novo mutation with parental germinal mosaicism. We hypothesised that the rearrangement was causative of their ASD and localised the chromosome 22 breakpoints. METHODS: The rearrangement was characterised using fluorescence in situ hybridisation, Southern blotting, inverse PCR and dideoxy-sequencing. Open reading frames and intron/exon boundaries of the two physically disrupted genes identified, TCF20 and TNRC6B, were sequenced in 342 families (260 multiplex and 82 simplex) ascertained by the International Molecular Genetic Study of Autism Consortium (IMGSAC). RESULTS: IMGSAC family screening identified a de novo missense mutation of TCF20 in a single case and significant association of a different missense mutation of TCF20 with ASD in three further families. Through exome sequencing in another project, we independently identified a de novo frameshifting mutation of TCF20 in a woman with ASD and moderate intellectual disability. We did not identify a significant association of TNRC6B mutations with ASD. CONCLUSIONS: TCF20 encodes a transcriptional coregulator (also termed SPBP) that is structurally and functionally related to RAI1, the critical dosage-sensitive protein implicated in the behavioural phenotypes of the Smith-Magenis and Potocki-Lupski 17p11.2 deletion/duplication syndromes, in which ASD is frequently diagnosed. This study provides the first evidence that mutations in TCF20 are also associated with ASD.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>51 (11), 737-47</Feld596><PubVol>51</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>737</StrtPage><EndPage>47</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Babbs C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Lloyd D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Pagnamenta AT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Twigg SR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Green J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="McGowan SJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Mirza G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Naples R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Sharma VP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Volpi EV" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Buckle VJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Wall SA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="IMGSAC" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Knight SJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Parr JR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Wilkie AO" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25228304</PMID><DOI>10.1136/jmedgenet-2014-102582</DOI><KST>B050</KST><KST>B063</KST></row><row><publishedID>54568</publishedID><Artikel>Betulinic Acid Derivatives NVX-207 and B10 for Treatment of Glioblastoma-An in Vitro Study of Cytotoxicity and Radiosensitization</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</Journal><ABSTr>Betulinic acid (BA), a pentacyclic triterpene, represents a new therapeutic substance that has potential benefits for treating glioblastoma. Recently, new strategies for producing BA derivatives with improved properties have evolved. However, few studies have examined the combination of BA or BA derivatives using radiotherapy. The effects of two BA derivatives, NVX-207 and B10, on cellular and radiobiological behavior were analyzed using glioblastoma cell lines (U251MG, U343MG and LN229). Based on IC50 values under normoxic conditions, we detected a 1.3-2.9-fold higher cytotoxicity of the BA derivatives B10 and NVX-207, respectively, compared to BA. Incubation using both BA derivatives led to decreased cell migration, cleavage of PARP and decreased protein expression levels of Survivin. Weak radiation sensitivity enhancement was observed in U251MG cells after treatment with both BA derivatives. The enhancement factors at an irradiation dose of 6 Gy after treatment with 5 microM NVX-207 and 5 microM B10 were 1.32 (p = 0.029) and 1.55 (p = 0.002), respectively. In contrast to BA, neither NVX-207 nor B10 had additional effects under hypoxic conditions. Our results suggest that the BA derivatives NVX-207 and B10 improve the effects of radiotherapy on human malignant glioma cells, particularly under normoxic conditions.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>15 (11), 19777-19790</Feld596><PubVol>15</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>19777</StrtPage><EndPage>19790</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Bache M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Bernhardt S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Passin S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Wichmann H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Hein A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Zschornak M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Kappler M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Taubert H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Paschke R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Vordermark D" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25361208</PMID><DOI>10.3390/ijms151119777</DOI><KST>B050</KST></row><row><publishedID>54569</publishedID><Artikel>Homozygous microdeletion of exon 5 in ZNF277 in a girl with specific language impairment</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Human Genetics</Journal><ABSTr>Specific language impairment (SLI), an unexpected failure to develop appropriate language skills despite adequate non-verbal intelligence, is a heterogeneous multifactorial disorder with a complex genetic basis. We identified a homozygous microdeletion of 21,379 bp in the ZNF277 gene (NM_021994.2), encompassing exon 5, in an individual with severe receptive and expressive language impairment. The microdeletion was not found in the proband's affected sister or her brother who had mild language impairment. However, it was inherited from both parents, each of whom carries a heterozygous microdeletion and has a history of language problems. The microdeletion falls within the AUTS1 locus, a region linked to autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs). Moreover, ZNF277 is adjacent to the DOCK4 and IMMP2L genes, which have been implicated in ASD. We screened for the presence of ZNF277 microdeletions in cohorts of children with SLI or ASD and panels of control subjects. ZNF277 microdeletions were at an increased allelic frequency in SLI probands (1.1%) compared with both ASD family members (0.3%) and independent controls (0.4%). We performed quantitative RT-PCR analyses of the expression of IMMP2L, DOCK4 and ZNF277 in individuals carrying either an IMMP2L_DOCK4 microdeletion or a ZNF277 microdeletion. Although ZNF277 microdeletions reduce the expression of ZNF277, they do not alter the levels of DOCK4 or IMMP2L transcripts. Conversely, IMMP2L_DOCK4 microdeletions do not affect the expression levels of ZNF277. We postulate that ZNF277 microdeletions may contribute to the risk of language impairments in a manner that is independent of the autism risk loci previously described in this region.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>22 (10), 1165-1171</Feld596><PubVol>22</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>1165</StrtPage><EndPage>1171</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ceroni F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Simpson NH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Francks C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Baird G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Conti-Ramsden G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Clark A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Bolton PF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Hennessy ER" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Donnelly P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Bentley DR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Martin H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="IMGSAC" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Consortium SLI" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Consortium WGS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Parr J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Pagnamenta AT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Maestrini E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Bacchelli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Fisher SE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Newbury DF" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24518835</PMID><DOI>10.1038/ejhg.2014.4</DOI><KST>B050</KST><KST>B063</KST></row><row><publishedID>54572</publishedID><Artikel>Aberrant DNA hypermethylation of SDHC: a novel mechanism of tumor development in Carney triad</Artikel><Journal>Endocrine-Related Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Carney triad (CT) is a rare condition with synchronous or metachronous occurrence of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), paragangliomas (PGLs), and pulmonary chondromas in a patient. In contrast to Carney-Stratakis syndrome (CSS) and familial PGL syndromes, no germline or somatic mutations in the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) complex subunits A, B, C, or D have been found in most tumors and/or patients with CT. Nonetheless, the tumors arising among patients with CT, CSS, or familial PGL share a similar morphology with loss of the SDHB subunit on the protein level. For the current study, we employed massive parallel bisulfite sequencing to evaluate DNA methylation patterns in CpG islands in proximity to the gene loci of all four SDH subunits. For the first time, we report on a recurrent aberrant dense DNA methylation at the gene locus of SDHC in tumors of patients with CT, which was not present in tumors of patients with CSS or PGL, or in sporadic GISTs with KIT mutations. This DNA methylation pattern was correlated to a reduced mRNA expression of SDHC, and concurrent loss of the SDHC subunit on the protein level. Collectively, these data suggest epigenetic inactivation of the SDHC gene locus with functional impairment of the SDH complex as a plausible alternate mechanism of tumorigenesis in CT.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>21 (4), 567-577</Feld596><PubVol>21</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>567</StrtPage><EndPage>577</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Haller F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Moskalev EA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Faucz FR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Barthelmess S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Wiemann S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Bieg M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Assie G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Bertherat J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Schaefer IM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Otto C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Rattenberry E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Maher ER" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Strobel P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Werner M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Carney JA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Hartmann A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Stratakis CA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Agaimy A" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24859990</PMID><DOI>10.1530/ERC-14-0254</DOI><KST>B050</KST><KST>B080</KST><KST>G200</KST><KEYWORD>GENES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METHYLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>germline mutations</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GASTROINTESTINAL STROMAL TUMORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOLECULAR-GENETICS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>pheochromocytomas</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FAMILIAL PARAGANGLIOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STRATAKIS-SYNDROME</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54575</publishedID><Artikel>Combined DNA methylation and gene expression profiling in gastrointestinal stromal tumors reveals hypomethylation of SPP1 as an independent prognostic factor</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) have distinct gene expression patterns according to localization, genotype and aggressiveness. DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides is an important mechanism for regulation of gene expression. We performed targeted DNA methylation analysis of 1.505 CpG loci in 807 cancer-related genes in a cohort of 76 GISTs, combined with genome-wide mRNA expression analysis in 22 GISTs, to identify signatures associated with clinicopathological parameters and prognosis. Principal component analysis revealed distinct DNA methylation patterns associated with anatomical localization, genotype, mitotic counts and clinical follow-up. Methylation of a single CpG dinucleotide in the non-CpG island promoter of SPP1 was significantly correlated with shorter disease-free survival. Hypomethylation of this CpG was an independent prognostic parameter in a multivariate analysis compared to anatomical localization, genotype, tumor size and mitotic counts in a cohort of 141 GISTs with clinical follow-up. The epigenetic regulation of SPP1 was confirmed in vitro, and the functional impact of SPP1 protein on tumorigenesis-related signaling pathways was demonstrated. In summary, SPP1 promoter methylation is a novel and independent prognostic parameter in GISTs, and might be helpful in estimating the aggressiveness of GISTs from the intermediate-risk category.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>136 (5), 1010-1023</Feld596><PubVol>136</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>1010</StrtPage><EndPage>1023</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Haller F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Zhang JD" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Moskalev EA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Braun A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Otto C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Geddert H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Riazalhosseini Y" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Ward A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Balwierz A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Schaefer IM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Cameron S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Ghadimi BM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Agaimy A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Fletcher JA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Hoheisel J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Hartmann A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Werner M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Wiemann S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="18" name="Sahin O" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25046773</PMID><DOI>10.1002/ijc.29088</DOI><KST>B070</KST><KST>B050</KST><KST>W110</KST><KEYWORD>RECEPTOR-ALPHA MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OSTEOPONTIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>KIT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PDGFRA MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TERM-FOLLOW-UP</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPIGENETICS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54584</publishedID><Artikel>Maternally inherited genetic variants of CADPS2 are present in autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disability patients</Artikel><Journal>EMBO Molecular Medicine</Journal><ABSTr>Intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are complex neuropsychiatric conditions, with overlapping clinical boundaries in many patients. We identified a novel intragenic deletion of maternal origin in two siblings with mild ID and epilepsy in the CADPS2 gene, encoding for a synaptic protein involved in neurotrophin release and interaction with dopamine receptor type 2 (D2DR). Mutation screening of 223 additional patients (187 with ASD and 36 with ID) identified a missense change of maternal origin disrupting CADPS2/D2DR interaction. CADPS2 allelic expression was tested in blood and different adult human brain regions, revealing that the gene was monoallelically expressed in blood and amygdala, and the expressed allele was the one of maternal origin. Cadps2 gene expression performed in mice at different developmental stages was biallelic in the postnatal and adult stages; however, a monoallelic (maternal) expression was detected in the embryonal stage, suggesting that CADPS2 is subjected to tissue- and temporal-specific regulation in human and mice. We suggest that CADPS2 variants may contribute to ID/ASD development, possibly through a parent-of-origin effect.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>6 (6), 795-809</Feld596><PubVol>6</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>795</StrtPage><EndPage>809</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Bonora E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Graziano C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Minopoli F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Bacchelli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Magini P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Diquigiovanni C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Lomartire S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Bianco F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Vargiolu M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Parchi P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Marasco E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Mantovani V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Rampoldi L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Trudu M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Parmeggiani A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Battaglia A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Mazzone L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Tortora G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="IMGSAC" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="19" name="Maestrini E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Seri M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Romeo G" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24737869</PMID><DOI>10.1002/emmm.201303235</DOI><KST>B050</KST><KST>B063</KST></row><row><publishedID>54595</publishedID><Artikel>Understanding and targeting alkylator resistance in glioblastoma</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Discovery</Journal><ABSTr>Alkylating chemotherapy is the mainstay in the treatment of pediatric and adult glioblastoma despite primary and acquired resistance and scientific efforts to precisely define therapies for individual patients.

Within this hierarchy, glioblastoma-initiating cells have been proposed to be more resistant to radiochemotherapy and responsible for recurrence. Here, established stem cell markers and stem cell attributed characteristics such as self-renewal capacity and tumorigenicity have been profiled in primary glioblastoma cultures to predict radiosensitivity. Furthermore, the sensitivity to radiotherapy of different subpopulations within a single primary glioblastoma culture was analyzed by a flow cytometric approach using Nestin, SRY (sex-determining region Y)-box 2 (SOX2) and glial fibrillary acidic protein. The protein expression of Nestin and SOX2 as well as the mRNA levels of Musashi1, L1 cell adhesion molecule, CD133, Nestin, and pleiomorphic adenoma gene-like 2 inversely correlated with radioresistance in regard to the clonogenic potential. Only CD44 protein expression correlated positively with radioresistance. In terms of proliferation, Nestin protein expression and Musashi1, pleiomorphic adenoma gene-like 2, and CD133 mRNA levels are inversely correlated with radioresistance. Higher expression of stem cell markers does not correlate with resistance to radiochemotherapy in the cancer genome atlas glioblastoma collective. SOX2 expressing subpopulations exist within single primary glioblastoma cultures. These subpopulations predominantly form the proliferative pool of the primary cultures and are sensitive to irradiation. Thus, profiling of established stem cell markers revealed a surprising result. Except CD44, the tested stem cell markers showed an inverse correlation between expression and radioresistance. Markers used to define glioma-initiating cells (GIC) are generally not defining a more resistant, but rather a more sensitive group of glioma cells. An exemption is CD44 expression. Also proliferation of the GIC culture itself was not systematically associated with radiosensitivity or - resistance, but a SOX-2 positive, proliferative subgroup within a GIC culture is showing the highest radiosensitivity.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>131 (2), 251-264</Feld596><PubVol>131</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>251</StrtPage><EndPage>264</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Lemke D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Weiler M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Blaes J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Wiestler B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Jestaedt L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Klein AC" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Low S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Eisele G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Radlwimmer B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Capper D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Schmieder K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Mittelbronn M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Combs SE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Bendszus M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Weller M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Platten M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="16" name="Wick W" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24976529</PMID><DOI>10.1111/jnc.12802</DOI><KST>B060</KST><KST>G380</KST><KST>G370</KST><KST>G160</KST><KEYWORD>INITIATING CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Niche</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>human glioma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMORIGENICITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BRAIN-TUMORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SELF-RENEWAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIFFERENTIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BETA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54608</publishedID><Artikel>Challenging cytomegalovirus data in glioblastoma</Artikel><Journal>Neuro-Oncology</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>16 (1), Art.

Metformin treatment, in addition to life style intervention, significantly reduced morning glucose and HbA(1c) whilst body weight and BMI were only marginally reduced during the 24 week trial. Treatment significantly reduced both plasma MG and carboxymethyl-lysine (CML), a marker of oxidative stress. The reduction in MG was paralleled by a significant increase in the activity of Glyoxalase 1 (Glo1), the major route of MG detoxification, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and red blood cells. Multivariate analysis showed that the changes in MG were dependent upon the metformin treatment.

This study supports previous findings that metformin can reduce plasma MG in type 2 diabetic patients. However, given the observed increase in Glo1 activity, this reduction is due not only to the scavenging properties of metformin, but the restoration of Glo1 activity.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>122 (5), 316-319</Feld596><PubVol>122</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>316</StrtPage><EndPage>319</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kender Z" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Fleming T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kopf S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Torzsa P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Grolmusz V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Herzig S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Schleicher E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Rácz K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Reismann P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Nawroth PP" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24710646</PMID><DOI>10.1055/s-0034-1371818</DOI><KST>A170</KST><KEYWORD>NEPHROPATHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DAMAGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OXIDATIVE-STRESS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLYCATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54630</publishedID><Artikel>The Omega 6-fatty acid, Arachidonic acid, regulates the conversion of white to brite adipocyte through a prostaglandin/calcium mediated pathway</Artikel><Journal>Molecular Metabolism</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>3 (9), 834-847</Feld596><PubVol>3</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>834</StrtPage><EndPage>847</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Pisani, D.F."

Epidemiological studies point to a reduced risk for hormone-dependent cancers in populations following a typical Asian diet rich in soy products. IF act as phytoestrogens and prevent tumorigenesis in rodent models by a broad spectrum of bioactivities. During the past 10 years, IF were shown to target all major epigenetic mechanisms regulating gene expression, including DNA methylation, histone modifications controlling chromatin accessibility, and non-coding RNAs. These effects have been suggested to contribute to cancer preventive potential in in vitro and in vivo studies, affecting several key processes such as DNA repair, cell signaling cascades including Wnt-signaling, induction of apoptosis, cell cycle progression, cell proliferation, migration and invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), metastasis formation and development of drug-resistance. We here summarize the state-of-the-art of IF affecting the epigenome in major hormone-dependent, urogenital, and gastrointestinal tumor types and in in vivo studies on anti-cancer treatment or developmental aspects, and short-term intervention studies in adults. These data, while often requiring replication, suggest that epigenetic gene regulation represents an important novel target of IF and should be taken into consideration when evaluating the cancer preventive potential of IF in humans.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>6 (10), 4218-4272</Feld596><PubVol>6</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>4218</StrtPage><EndPage>4272</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Pudenz,M."

Here we identify neuroblastoma-suppressive functions of the p19-INK4d CDK inhibitor and uncover mechanisms of its repression in high-risk neuroblastomas. Reduced p19-INK4d expression was associated with poor event-free and overall survival and neuroblastoma risk factors including amplified MYCN in a set of 478 primary neuroblastomas. High MYCN expression repressed p19-INK4d mRNA and protein levels in different neuroblastoma cell models with conditional MYCN expression. MassARRAY and 450K methylation analyses of 105 primary neuroblastomas uncovered a differentially methylated region within p19-INK4d. Hypermethylation of this region was associated with reduced p19-INK4d expression. In accordance, p19-INK4d expression was activated upon treatment with the demethylating agent, 2'-deoxy-5-azacytidine, in neuroblastoma cell lines. Ectopic p19-INK4d expression decreased viability, clonogenicity and the capacity for anchorage-independent growth of neuroblastoma cells, and shifted the cell cycle towards the G1/0 phase. p19-INK4d also induced neurite-like processes and markers of neuronal differentiation. Moreover, neuroblastoma cell differentiation, induced by all-trans retinoic acid or NGF-NTRK1-signaling, activated p19-/NK4dexpression. Our findings pinpoint p19-INK4d as a neuroblastoma suppressor and provide evidence for MYCN-mediated repression and for epigenetic silencing of p19-INK4d by DNA hypermethylation in high-risk neuroblastomas.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (25), 6826-6837</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>25</PubIss><StrtPage>6826</StrtPage><EndPage>6837</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Dreidax,D."

Data for the incidence of such conditions exist in cohort studies worldwide, which, however, differ in various aspects. The Consortium on Health and Ageing: Network of Cohorts in Europe and the United States (CHANCES) project aims at harmonizing data from existing major longitudinal studies for the elderly whilst focussing on cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus, cancer, fractures and cognitive impairment in order to estimate their prevalence, incidence and cause-specific mortality, and identify lifestyle, socioeconomic, and genetic determinants and biomarkers for the incidence of and mortality from these conditions. A survey instrument assessing ageing-related conditions of the elderly will be also developed. Fourteen cohort studies participate in CHANCES with 683,228 elderly (and 150,210 deaths), from 23 European and three non-European countries. So far, 287 variables on health conditions and a variety of exposures, including biomarkers and genetic data have been harmonized. Different research hypotheses are investigated with meta-analyses. The results which will be produced can help international organizations, governments and policy-makers to better understand the broader implications and consequences of ageing and thus make informed decisions.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>29 (12), 929-936</Feld596><PubVol>29</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>929</StrtPage><EndPage>936</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Boffetta P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Bobak M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Börsch-Supan A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Eriksson S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Grodstein F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Jansen E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Jenab M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Juerges H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Kampman E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Kee F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Kuulasmaa K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Park Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="van Duijn C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Wilsgaards T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Wolk A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Trichopoulos D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Bamia C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25504016</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s10654-014-9977-1</DOI><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>MORTALITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPIDEMIOLOGY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONSUMPTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIFE-STYLE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIET</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WOMEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISABILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OSTEOPOROTIC FRACTURES</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>54842</publishedID><Artikel>Die Rolle humaner Papillomviren bei Mundhöhlenkarzinomen</Artikel><Journal>IGZ-Die Alternative</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596> (3), 7-9</Feld596><PubVol/><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>7</StrtPage><EndPage>9</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Reuschenbach, M."

We investigated whether variation in prostaglandin synthesis and related pathways influences CRC risk in the Colon Cancer Family Registry by examining associations between 192 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and two variable nucleotide tandem repeats (VNTRs) within 17 candidate genes and CRC risk. We further assessed interactions between these polymorphisms and NSAID use on CRC risk. Using a case-unaffected-sibling-control design, this study included 1621 primary invasive CRC cases and 2592 sibling controls among Caucasian men and women aged 18-90. After adjustment for multiple comparisons, two intronic SNPs were associated with rectal cancer risk: rs11571364 in ALOX12 [OR(het/hzv) = 1.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.19-2.95, P = 0.03] and rs45525634 in PTGER2 (OR(het/hzv) = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.29-0.82, P = 0.03). Additionally, there was an interaction between NSAID use and the intronic SNP rs2920421 in ALOX12 on risk of CRC (P = 0.03); among those with heterozygous genotypes, risk was reduced for current NSAID users compared with never or former users (OR(het) = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.45-0.80), though not among those with homozygous wild-type or variant genotypes. The results of this study suggest that genetic variation in ALOX12 and PTGER2 may affect the risk of rectal cancer. In addition, this study suggests plausible interactions between NSAID use and variants in ALOX12 on CRC risk. These results may aid in the development of genetically targeted cancer prevention strategies with NSAIDs.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>35 (9), 2121-2126</Feld596><PubVol>35</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>2121</StrtPage><EndPage>2126</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Resler, A."

At the molecular level, the assembly mechanism for actin filaments and microtubules is fundamentally different from that of IFs. The former two types of filaments assemble from globular proteins. By contrast, IFs assemble from tetrameric complexes of extended, half-staggered, and antiparallel oriented coiled-coils. These tetramers laterally associate into unit-length filaments; subsequent longitudinal annealing of unit-length filaments yields mature IFs. In vitro, IFs form open structures without a fixed number of tetramers per cross-section along the filament. Therefore, a central question for the structural biology of IFs is whether individual subunits can dissociate from assembled filaments and rebind at other sites. Using the fluorescently labeled IF-protein vimentin for assembly, we directly observe and quantitatively determine subunit exchange events between filaments as well as with soluble vimentin pools. Thereby we demonstrate that the cross-sectional polymorphism of donor and acceptor filaments plays an important role. We propose that in segments of donor filaments with more than the standard 32 molecules per cross-section, subunits are not as tightly bound and are predisposed to be released from the filament.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>107 (12), 2914-2922</Feld596><PubVol>107</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>2914</StrtPage><EndPage>2922</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Noeding, B."

Here, we report a versatile set of plasmids and vectors derived from adeno-associated virus (AAV) that allow robust and specific delivery of the two essential CRISPR components - Cas9 and chimeric g(uide)RNA - either alone or in combination. All our constructs share a modular design that enables simple and stringent guide RNA (gRNA) cloning as well as rapid exchange of promoters driving Cas9 or gRNA. Packaging into potent synthetic AAV capsids permits CRISPR delivery even into hard-to-transfect targets, as shown for human T-cells. Moreover, we demonstrate the feasibility to direct Cas9 expression to or away from hepatocytes, using a liver-specific promoter or a hepatic miRNA binding site, respectively. We also report a streamlined and economical protocol for detection of CRISPR-induced mutations in less than 3 h. Finally, we provide original evidence that AAV/CRISPR vectors can be exploited for gene engineering in vivo, as exemplified in the liver of adult mice. Our new tools and protocols should foster the broad application of CRISPR technology in eukaryotic cells and organisms, and accelerate its clinical translation into humans.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (11), 1402-1412</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>1402</StrtPage><EndPage>1412</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Senis E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Fatouros C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Grosse S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Wiedtke E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Niopek D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Mueller AK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Borner K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Grimm D" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25186301</PMID><DOI>10.1002/biot.201400046</DOI><KST>B080</KST><KEYWORD>CAS SYSTEMS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CRISPR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>liver</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMMUNITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VIRUS VECTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENDONUCLEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GUIDE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>55021</publishedID><Artikel>Polymorphisms in circadian genes, night work and breast cancer: Results from the GENICA study</Artikel><Journal>

The relationships between current biological and clinical concepts such as cell migration modes, tumour budding and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) remains unclear in several aspects, especially for the 'real' situation in human cancer. We developed a novel method that provides exact three-dimensional (3D) information on both microscopic morphology and gene expression, over a virtually unlimited spatial range, by reconstruction from serial immunostained tissue slices. Quantitative 3D assessment of tumour budding at the cancer-host interface in human pancreatic, colorectal, lung and breast adenocarcinoma suggests collective cell migration as the mechanism of cancer cell invasion, while single cancer cell migration seems to be virtually absent. Budding tumour cells display a shift towards spindle-like as well as a rounded morphology. This is associated with decreased E-cadherin staining intensity and a shift from membranous to cytoplasmic staining, as well as increased nuclear ZEB1 expression.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>234 (3), 410-422</Feld596><PubVol>234</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>410</StrtPage><EndPage>422</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Bronsert P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Enderle-Ammour K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bader M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Timme S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kuehs M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Csanadi A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Kayser G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Kohler I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Bausch D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Hoeppner J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Hopt UT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Keck T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Stickeler E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Passlick B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Schilling O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Reiss CP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Vashist Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Brabletz T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="18" name="Berger J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Lotz J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Olesch J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Werner M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="22" name="Wellner UF" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25081610</PMID><DOI>10.1002/path.4416</DOI><KST>L601</KST><KEYWORD>CIRCULATING TUMOR-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPITHELIAL-MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLORECTAL-CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METASTASIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BREAST-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGNOSTIC VALUE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECONSTRUCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LUNG</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SERIAL SECTIONS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>55036</publishedID><Artikel>The 19q12 Bladder Cancer GWAS Signal: Association with Cyclin E Function and Aggressive Disease</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Research</Journal><ABSTr>A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of bladder cancer identified a genetic marker rs8102137 within the 19q12 region as a novel susceptibility variant. This marker is located upstream of the CCNE1 gene, which encodes cyclin E, a cell-cycle protein. We performed genetic fine-mapping analysis of the CCNE1 region using data from two bladder cancer GWAS (5,942 cases and 10,857 controls). We found that the original GWAS marker rs8102137 represents a group of 47 linked SNPs (with r(2) &gt;/= 0.7) associated with increased bladder cancer risk. From this group, we selected a functional promoter variant rs7257330, which showed strong allele-specific binding of nuclear proteins in several cell lines. In both GWASs, rs7257330 was associated only with aggressive bladder cancer, with a combined per-allele OR = 1.18 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09-1.27, P = 4.67 x 10(-5)] versus OR = 1.01 (95% CI, 0.93-1.10, P = 0.79) for nonaggressive disease, with P = 0.0015 for case-only analysis. Cyclin E protein expression analyzed in 265 bladder tumors was increased in aggressive tumors (P = 0.013) and, independently, with each rs7257330-A risk allele (Ptrend = 0.024). Overexpression of recombinant cyclin E in cell lines caused significant acceleration of cell cycle. In conclusion, we defined the 19q12 signal as the first GWAS signal specific for aggressive bladder cancer. Molecular mechanisms of this genetic association may be related to cyclin E overexpression and alteration of cell cycle in carriers of CCNE1 risk variants. In combination with established bladder cancer risk factors and other somatic and germline genetic markers, the CCNE1 variants could be useful for inclusion into bladder cancer risk prediction models.

Cell Deficiency</Artikel><Journal>Diabetes</Journal><ABSTr>Mast cells have been invoked as important players in immune responses associated with autoimmune diseases. Based on in vitro studies, or in vivo through the use of Kit mutant mice, mast cells have been suggested to play immunological roles in direct antigen presentation to both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, in the regulation of T-cell and dendritic cell migration to lymph nodes, and in Th1 versus Th2 polarization, all of which could significantly impact the immune response against self-antigens in autoimmune disease, including type 1 diabetes (T1D). Until now, the role of mast cells in the onset and incidence of T1D has only been indirectly tested through the use of low-specificity mast cell inhibitors and activators, and published studies reported contrasting results. Our three laboratories have generated independently two strains of mast cell-deficient nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, NOD.Cpa3(Cre/+) (Heidelberg) and NOD.Kit(W-sh/W-sh) (Leuven and Boston), to address the effects of mast cell deficiency on the development of T1D in the NOD strain. Our collective data demonstrate that both incidence and progression of T1D in NOD mice are independent of mast cells. Moreover, analysis of pancreatic lymph node cells indicated that lack of mast cells has no discernible effect on the autoimmune response, which involves both innate and adaptive immune components. Our results demonstrate that mast cells are not involved in T1D in the NOD strain, making their role in this process nonessential and excluding them as potential therapeutic targets.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>63 (11), 3827-3834</Feld596><PubVol>63</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>3827</StrtPage><EndPage>3834</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Gutierrez DA" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Fu W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Schonefeldt S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Feyerabend TB" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Ortiz-Lopez A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Lampi Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Liston A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Mathis D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Rodewald HR" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24917576</PMID><DOI>10.2337/db14-0372</DOI><KST>D110</KST><KEYWORD>W-SH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AUTOIMMUNITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EFFECTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>C-KIT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOUSE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMMUNE-RESPONSE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>T-CELL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DENDRITIC CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LYMPH-NODES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BIOBREEDING RAT</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>55042</publishedID><Artikel>Hypoxia-dependent mRNA expression pattern of splicing factor YT521 and its impact on oncological important target gene expression</Artikel><Journal>Molecular Carcinogenesis</Journal><ABSTr>The ubiquitously expressed splicing factor YT521 (YTHDC1) is characterized by alternatively spliced isoforms with regulatory impact on cancer-associated gene expression. Our recent findings account for the prognostic significance of YT521 in endometrial cancer. In this study, we investigated the hypoxia-dependency of YT521 expression as well as its differential isoform activities on oncological important target genes. YT521's potential regulatory influence on splicing was investigated by a minigene assay for the specific target gene CD44. Functional splicing analysis was performed by YT521 knock-down or overexpression, respectively. In addition, YT521 expression was determined under hypoxia. The two protein-generating YT521 mRNA isoforms 1 and 2 caused a comparable, specific induction of CD44v alternative splicing (P &lt; 0.01). In a number of oncological target genes, YT521 upregulation significantly altered BRCA2 expression pattern, while YT521 knock-down created a significant regulatory impact on PGR expression, respectively. Hypoxia induced a specific switch towards the processing of two non-protein-coding mRNA variants, of which one is described for the first time in this study. The presented study underlines the comparable regulatory potential of both YT521 isoforms 1 and 2, on the investigated target genes in vivo and in vitro. Hypoxia induces a specific switch in YT521 expression pattern towards the two non-protein coding mRNA variants, the already characterized isoform 3 and the newly discovered exon 8-skipping isoform. The altered YT521 alternative splicing is functionally coupled with nonsense-mediated decay and can be interpreted as regulated unproductive splicing and transcription with consecutive impact on the processing of specific cancer-associated genes, such as BRCA2 and PGR.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>53 (11), 883-892</Feld596><PubVol>53</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>883</StrtPage><EndPage>892</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hirschfeld M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Zhang B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Jaeger M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Stamm S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Erbes T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Mayer S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Tong X" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Stickeler E" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>23765422</PMID><DOI>10.1002/mc.22045</DOI><KST>L601</KST><KEYWORD>GROWTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>brain</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TYROSINE PHOSPHORYLATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BREAST-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VARIANT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BINDING-PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGNOSTIC-FACTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>nonsense-mediated decay</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>55043</publishedID><Artikel>Discovery of Inhibitors of Schistosoma mansoni HDAC8 by Combining Homology Modeling, Virtual Screening, and in Vitro Validation</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling</Journal><ABSTr>Schistosomiasis, caused by S. mansoni, is a tropical disease that affects over 200 million people worldwide. A novel approach for targeting eukaryotic parasites is to tackle their dynamic epigenetic machinery that is necessary for the extensive phenotypic changes during their life cycle. We recently identified S. mansoni histone deacetylase 8 (smHDAC8) as a potential target for antiparasitic therapy. Here we present results from a virtual screening campaign on smHDAC8. Besides hydroxamates, several sulfonamide-thiazole derivatives were identified by a target-based virtual screening using a homology model of smHDAC8. In vitro testing of 75 compounds identified 8 hydroxamates as potent and lead-like inhibitors of the parasitic HDAC8. Solving of the crystal structure of smHDAC8 with two of the virtual screening hits confirmed the predicted binding mode.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>54 (10), 3005-3019</Feld596><PubVol>54</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>3005</StrtPage><EndPage>3019</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kannan S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Melesina J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Hauser AT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Chakrabarti A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Heimburg T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Schmidtkunz K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Walter A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Marek M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Pierce RJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Romier C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Jung M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Sippl W" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25243797</PMID><DOI>10.1021/ci5004653</DOI><KST>L601</KST><KEYWORD>FLEXIBLE DOCKING</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HISTONE DEACETYLASE INHIBITORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPIGENETICS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>resistance</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SIMULATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>transcription</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MODIFYING ENZYMES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ZINC</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PRAZIQUANTEL</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>55044</publishedID><Artikel>International society of neuropathology-haarlem consensus guidelines for nervous system tumor classification and grading</Artikel><Journal>Brain Pathology</Journal><ABSTr>Major discoveries in the biology of nervous system tumors have raised the question of how non-histological data such as molecular information can be incorporated into the next World Health Organization (WHO) classification of central nervous system tumors. To address this question, a meeting of neuropathologists with expertise in molecular diagnosis was held in Haarlem, the Netherlands, under the sponsorship of the International Society of Neuropathology (ISN). Prior to the meeting, participants solicited input from clinical colleagues in diverse neuro-oncological specialties. The present "white paper" catalogs the recommendations of the meeting, at which a consensus was reached that incorporation of molecular information into the next WHO classification should follow a set of provided "ISN-Haarlem" guidelines. Salient recommendations include that (i) diagnostic entities should be defined as narrowly as possible to optimize interobserver reproducibility, clinicopathological predictions and therapeutic planning; (ii) diagnoses should be "layered" with histologic classification, WHO grade and molecular information listed below an "integrated diagnosis"; (iii) determinations should be made for each tumor entity as to whether molecular information is required, suggested or not needed for its definition; (iv) some pediatric entities should be separated from their adult counterparts; (v) input for guiding decisions regarding tumor classification should be solicited from experts in complementary disciplines of neuro-oncology; and (iv) entity-specific molecular testing and reporting formats should be followed in diagnostic reports. It is hoped that these guidelines will facilitate the forthcoming update of the fourth edition of the WHO classification of central nervous system tumors.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>24 (5), 429-35</Feld596><PubVol>24</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>429</StrtPage><EndPage>35</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Louis DN" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Perry A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Burger P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Ellison DW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Reifenberger G" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="von Deimling A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Aldape K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Brat D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Collins VP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Eberhart C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Figarella-Branger D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Fuller GN" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Giangaspero F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Giannini C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Hawkins C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Kleihues P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Korshunov A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="17" name="Kros JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Beatriz Lopes M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Ng HK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Ohgaki H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Paulus W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Pietsch T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Rosenblum M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Rushing E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Soylemezoglu F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Wiestler O" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="27" name="Wesseling P" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24990071</PMID><DOI>10.1111/bpa.12171</DOI><KST>M010</KST><KST>G380</KST><KST>L401</KST></row><row><publishedID>55046</publishedID><Artikel>[Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN)]</Artikel><Journal>Radiologe</Journal><ABSTr>CLINICAL ISSUE: Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) types 1 and 2 are hereditary cancer syndromes. They are characterized by the occurrence of many benign and malignant tumor types. STANDARD TREATMENT: Carriers of a MEN1 or RET gene mutation can be identified before manifestation of the disease. Family screening allows the early diagnosis and therapy of gene carriers. TREATMENT INNOVATIONS: Early thyroidectomy in young patients with MEN2 results in a high cure rate of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), such as vadetanib and cabozantinib, represents an important new therapeutic option for patients with progressive metastatic MTC. Neuroendocrine tumors (MEN1) are treated surgically and progressive disease is treated with somatostatin or everolimus. DIAGNOSTICS: The most important imaging methods for monitoring of MTC are sonography of the neck and upper abdomen and computed tomography (CT) of the lungs. In cases of MEN1 metastases can be localized by DOTATOC positron emission tomography CT (PET/CT). PERFORMANCE: Using these methods up to 70 % of tumors and metastases can be detected, depending on the localization, size and endocrine activity. Follow-up investigations with CT is an important tool for monitoring changes in tumor mass which are important criteria for decisions concerning TKI therapy. ACHIEVEMENTS: Together with the doubling time of tumor markers, tumor progression monitored by imaging methods or response evaluation criteria In solid tumors (RECIST) are prognostic factors and provide indications for initiating systemic therapy (e.g. TKI) PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS: Patients with MEN syndromes should be treated in specialized centers because of the complexity and rarity.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>54 (10), 975-980</Feld596><PubVol>54</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>975</StrtPage><EndPage>980</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Raue F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Wilhelm T" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25223437</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00117-014-2692-9</DOI><KST>E010</KST><KEYWORD>GENE CARRIERS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TYPE-1 MEN1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THYROIDECTOMY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIAGNOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GUIDELINES</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>55048</publishedID><Artikel>Circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in relation to renal cell carcinoma incidence and survival in the EPIC cohort</Artikel><Journal>American Journal of Epidemiology</Journal><ABSTr>Normal renal function is essential for vitamin D metabolism, but it is unclear whether circulating vitamin D is associated with risk of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We assessed whether 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) was associated with risk of RCC and death after RCC diagnosis in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). EPIC recruited 385,747 participants with blood samples between 1992 and 2000. The current study included 560 RCC cases, 557 individually matched controls, and 553 additional controls. Circulating 25(OH)D3 was assessed by mass spectrometry. Conditional and unconditional logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Death after RCC diagnosis was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models and flexible parametric survival models. A doubling of 25(OH)D3 was associated with 28% lower odds of RCC after adjustment for season of and age at blood collection, sex, and country of recruitment (odds ratio = 0.72, 95% confidence interval: 0.60, 0.86; P = 0.0004). This estimate was attenuated somewhat after additional adjustment for smoking status at baseline, circulating cotinine, body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)(2)), and alcohol intake (odds ratio = 0.82, 95% confidence interval: 0.68, 0.99; P = 0.038). There was also some indication that both low and high 25(OH)D3 levels were associated with higher risk of death from any cause among RCC cases.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>180 (8), 810-820</Feld596><PubVol>180</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>810</StrtPage><EndPage>820</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Mueller DC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Fanidi A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Midttun O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Steffen A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Dossus L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Boutron-Ruault MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Severi G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Kuehn T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Katzke V" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="de la Torre RA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Gonzalez CA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Sanchez MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Dorronsoro M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Santiuste C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Barricarte A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Wareham N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Travis RC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Giotaki M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Trichopoulos D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Palli D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Krogh V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Vineis P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Panico S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Olsen A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Peeters PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Ljungberg B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Wennberg M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Murphy N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Ueland PM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Brennan P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Johansson M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25205830</PMID><DOI>10.1093/aje/kwu204</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>older men</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMMUNITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VITAMIN-D</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENERAL-POPULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PLASMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WOMEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ULTRAVIOLET-B</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>55049</publishedID><Artikel>Riproximin's activity depends on gene Expression and sensitizes PDAC cells to TRAIL</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Biology and Therapy</Journal><ABSTr>Riproximin (Rpx) is a type II ribosome inactivating protein, which was investigated for its activity in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in a panel of 17 human and rat PDAC cell lines and in rat pancreatic cancer liver metastasis.

We elucidated novel intracellular BSP functions by a conditional knockdown of BSP. Conditional MDA-MB-231 subclones were equipped with a novel gene expression cassette containing a tet-regulated miRNA providing knockdown of BSP production. These clones were used to assess the effect of BSP on morphology, proliferation, migration, colony formation and gene expression in vitro, and on soft tissue and osteolytic lesions in a xenograft model by three imaging methods. BSP knockdown caused significant anti-proliferative, anti-migratory and anti-clonogenic effects in vitro (p&lt;0.001). In vivo, significant decreases of soft tissue and osteolytic lesions (p&lt;0.03) were recorded after 3 weeks of miRNA treatment, leading to complete remission within 6 weeks. Microarray data revealed that 0.3% of genes were modulated in response to BSP knockdown. Upregulated genes included the endoplasmic reticulum stress genes ATF3 and DDIT3, the tumor suppressor gene EGR1, ID2 (related to breast epithelial differentiation), c-FOS and SERPINB2, whereas the metastasis associated genes CD44 and IL11 were downregulated. Also, activation of apoptotic pathways was demonstrated. These results implicate that intracellular BSP is essential for breast cancer skeletal metastasis and a target for treating these lesions.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>5 (14), 5510-5522</Feld596><PubVol>5</PubVol><PubIss>14</PubIss><StrtPage>5510</StrtPage><EndPage>5522</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kovacheva M."

Our hypothesis was that, during liver colonization, the temporal modulation of processes related to metastasis will change in a specific manner and that information on these changes might be used for new therapeutic approaches. 
Material and Methods: PDAC rat ASML cells were inoculated into the liver of BDX rats and re-isolated after different time periods of liver
colonization (early, intermediate, advanced, and terminal). The total RNA of these samples was used to evaluate the expression profiles of more than 23,000 genes by chip array analysis. 

Conclusion: We hypothesize that targeting the relatively few deregulated genes in the early stage of liver colonization could ultimately improve the survival of PDAC patients.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>37 (9), 464-470</Feld596><PubVol>37</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>464</StrtPage><EndPage>470</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Al-Taee K.K."

In the same study, an accumulation of chromosomal deletions was found in cancers of elderly patients. To determine how age-dependent molecular features relate to cancer phenotype, an existing data set of 11 152 PCas was expanded by additional fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), 6q15 and 5q21. The results demonstrate that the decrease in TMPRSS2-ERG fusions with increasing patient age is limited to low-grade cancers (Gleason &lt;= 3 + 4) and that the significant increase in the deletion frequency with age was strictly limited to ERG-negative cancers for 6q15 and 5q21 but to ERG-positive cancers for PTEN. These data suggest that the accumulation of non-androgen-linked genomic alterations with advanced patient age may require an appropriate microenvironment, such as a positive or negative ERG status. The strong link of ERG activation to young patient age and low-grade cancers may help to explain a slight predominance of low-grade cancers in young patients.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>66 (6), 978-981</Feld596><PubVol>66</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>978</StrtPage><EndPage>981</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Steurer,S."

The mode of action of decitabine strictly depends on the incorporation of the drug into DNA. However, DNA incorporation and ensuing genotoxic effects of decitabine have not yet been investigated in human cancer cell lines or in models related to the approved indication of the drug. Here we describe a robust assay for the quantitative determination of decitabine incorporation rates into DNA from human cancer cells. Using a panel of human myeloid leukemia cell lines we show appreciable amounts of decitabine incorporation that closely correlated with cellular drug uptake. Decitabine incorporation was also detectable in primary cells from myeloid leukemia patients, indicating that the assay is suitable for biomarker analyses to predict drug responses in patients. Finally, we also used next-generation sequencing to comprehensively analyze the effects of decitabine incorporation on the DNA sequence level. Interestingly, this approach failed to reveal significant changes in the rates of point mutations and genome rearrangements in myeloid leukemia cell lines. These results indicate that standard rates of decitabine incorporation are not genotoxic in myeloid leukemia cells.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>42 (19), e152-</Feld596><PubVol>42</PubVol><PubIss>19</PubIss><StrtPage>e152</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Oez,S."

Formation of covalent DNA adducts after ellipticine enzymatic activation is one of the most important mechanisms of its pharmacological action. In this study, we investigated whether ellipticine might be released from its micellar (encapsulated)
form to generate covalent adducts analogous to those formed by free ellipticine. The 32P-postlabeling technique was used as a useful imaging method to detect and quantify covalent ellipticine-derived DNA adducts. We compared the efficiencies of free ellipticine and its micellar form (the poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(allyl glycidyl ether) (PAGE-PEO) block copolymer, P 119 nanoparticles) to form ellipticine-DNA adducts in rats in vivo. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that treatment of rats with ellipticine in
micelles resulted in formation of ellipticine-derived DNA adducts in vivo and suggest that a gradual release of ellipticine from its micellar form might produce the enhanced permeation and retention effect of this ellipticine-micellar delivery system</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>14 (12), 22982-22997</Feld596><PubVol>14</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>22982</StrtPage><EndPage>22997</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Stiborova, M."

Materials and Methods: Twenty-four men underwent magnetic resonance imaging-targeted fusion-guided transperineal saturation prostate biopsy, each with half standard bevelled and half trocar-sharpened needles. All taken biopsies were scored (1=worse to 5=best) by one urologist for the following criteria. (1) Accuracy of matching between planned and performed biopsy. (2) Histologic quality of the sample. (3) Elegance, which is the easiness to take the biopsy in proper time, planned position, and best histologic quality. Afterward, the histologic sample quality was evaluated by a blinded pathologist. To show a possible training effect, blinded untrained junior residents performed biopsies in four men (103 cores). Results: Overall, 600 single biopsies were analyzed. The trocar-sharpened needles demonstrated a significantly (p&lt;0.05) better scoring for accuracy and elegance rated by the urologist. The histologic quality scored by the pathologist was superior. Moreover, significantly lower target errors with trocar-sharpened needles were achieved by untrained residents, but not by the experienced user. Conclusion: Using trocar-sharpened needles helps urologists to perform targeted prostate biopsy more elegantly and accurately. In addition, the histopathologic sample quality was superior, which may directly improve diagnostic certainty. There is an undeniable training effect in image-guided biopsy and unexperienced users can significantly reduce target errors with trocar-sharpened needles.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>28 (11), 1384-1388</Feld596><PubVol>28</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>1384</StrtPage><EndPage>1388</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Simpfendoerfer,T."

The association between self-reported diabetes mellitus at recruitment and risk of prostate cancer was examined in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC). Among 139,131 eligible men, 4,531 were diagnosed with prostate cancer over an average follow-up of 12 years. Multivariable hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models stratified by EPIC-participating center and age at recruitment, and adjusted for education, smoking status, body mass index, waist circumference, and physical activity. In a subset of men without prostate cancer, the cross-sectional association between circulating concentrations of androgens and insulin-like growth factor proteins with diabetes status was also investigated using linear regression models. Compared to men with no diabetes, men with diabetes had a 26% lower risk of prostate cancer (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.63-0.86). There was no evidence that the association differed by stage (p-heterogeneity, 0.19) or grade (p-heterogeneity, 0.48) of the disease, although the numbers were small in some disease subgroups. In a subset of 626 men with hormone measurements, circulating concentrations of androstenedione, total testosterone and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-three were lower in men with diabetes compared to men without diabetes. This large European study has confirmed an inverse association between self-reported diabetes mellitus and subsequent risk of prostate cancer.

What's new? Emerging evidence suggests that men with type 2 diabetes are at lower risk to develop prostate cancer. Using data obtained within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), the authors show that the prostate cancer risk was, indeed, reduced by 26% in men with type 2 diabetes but no association with cancer stage or grade was observed. In a subset of men for whom data on circulating hormones were available, levels of androstenedione, total testosterone and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-three were lower in those with diabetes as compared to those without diabetes, giving clues to how having diabetes could affect prostate cancer development.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>136 (2), 372-381</Feld596><PubVol>136</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>372</StrtPage><EndPage>381</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Tsilidis, K.K."

Here, we used metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples to identify taxonomic markers that distinguished CRC patients from tumor-free controls in a study population of 156 participants. Accuracy of metagenomic CRC detection was similar to the standard fecal occult blood test (FOBT) and when both approaches were combined, sensitivity improved &gt; 45% relative to the FOBT, while maintaining its specificity. Accuracy of metagenomic CRC detection did not differ significantly between early- and late-stage cancer and could be validated in independent patient and control populations (N = 335) from different countries. CRC-associated changes in the fecal microbiome at least partially reflected microbial community composition at the tumor itself, indicating that observed gene pool differences may reveal tumor-related host-microbe interactions. Indeed, we deduced a metabolic shift from fiber degradation in controls to utilization of host carbohydrates and amino acids in CRC patients, accompanied by an increase of lipopolysaccharide metabolism.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>28 (10), Art.

While women's health is addressed in the basic interview, direct detection of cervicovaginal microbial colonisation or infection is not part of the examination protocol. In a pilot project the feasibility of female study participants of the GNC collecting a cervicovaginal lavage at home without having to involve a gynecologist or other medical personnel was thus investigated. The ability of the procedure to detect vaginal microbes and conditions including human papillomavirus (HPV), Chlamydia trachomatis and bacterial vaginosis (BV) were also explored.

This cross-sectional study was conducted in two study centers (Hamburg and Hanover) of the GNC during Pretest 2 in 2012 as an add-on module to the main program of the National Cohort. Participants were randomly selected through the population registration office. After providing written informed consent at the study center, participants self-collected a cervicovaginal lavage (Delphi Screener (TM)) at home following written instructions. Participants mailed samples and acceptability questionnaires to the laboratory and the study center, respectively. Acceptability of self-sampling was categorized as consent, partial consent and rejection. The samples were analyzed by multiplex HPV genotyping for the presence of 27 mucosal HPV subtypes. To detect other pathogens "Sexually Transmitted Infection Profiling" (STIP) was used, a novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for various vaginally occurring pathogens/conditions coupled with subsequent bead-based Luminex(A (R)) hybridization. Human beta-globin and DNA polymerase alpha (PolA) sequences were used as positive controls for the detection of human DNA during HPV detection and STIP, respectively.

The participation based on the proportion of all women in Pretest 2 who could take part in the add-on Pretest 2 was 67.3 % (109 out of 162). The age of participants ranged from 20 to 69 years. The self-reported median duration of the collection of the lavage was 5 min. Analysis of the questionnaires (n = 108) revealed that the self-sampling of a cervicovaginal lavage was acceptable to 98 % of women (106 out of 108), and considered to be easy by 89 % (96 out of 108) as well as user-friendly by 96 % of the women (104 out of 108). Human beta-globin and PolA as markers for human DNA and sample quality were detected in all samples analyzed while HPV as a marker for pathogen detectability was identified in 18 out of 109 samples. Of the 107 samples tested with STIP as a second marker for pathogen detectability, 5 samples were excluded from statistical analyses on bacterial colonization because of signs in the laboratory results of the use of antibiotics. For the computation of the possible occurrence of bacterial vaginosis and candidiasis 7 and 8 samples, respectively, were excluded because of low signal intensities resulting in an evaluation of 95 or 94 samples, respectively. Ureaplasma parvum was detected in 22 out of 102 samples, BV in 14 out of 95 samples and candidiasis in 13 out of 94 samples. Chlamydia trachomatis was not detected in any sample.

The feasibility study on cervicovaginal self-sampling indicates that this form of biosampling was very well accepted within the framework of the GNC and feasible in terms of pathogen detection. Its further application in the GNC would allow investigation of transience and persistence, or long-term effects of vaginal (co)infections and colonization.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>57 (11), 1270-1276</Feld596><PubVol>57</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>1270</StrtPage><EndPage>1276</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Castell,S."

We assessed departures from additivity on the absolute risk scale between 9 established breast cancer risk factors and 23 susceptibility single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified from genome-wide association studies among 10,146 non-Hispanic white breast cancer cases and 12,760 controls within the National Cancer Institute's Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium. We estimated the relative excess risk due to interaction and its 95% confidence interval for each pairwise combination of SNPs and nongenetic risk factors using age- and cohort-adjusted logistic regression models. After correction for multiple comparisons, we identified a statistically significant relative excess risk due to interaction (uncorrected P = 4.51 x 10(-5)) between a SNP in the DNA repair protein RAD51 homolog 2 gene (RAD51L1; rs10483813) and body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)(2)). We also compared additive and multiplicative polygenic risk prediction models using per-allele odds ratio estimates from previous studies for breast-cancer susceptibility SNPs and observed that the multiplicative model had a substantially better goodness of fit than the additive model.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>180 (10), 1018-1027</Feld596><PubVol>180</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>1018</StrtPage><EndPage>1027</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Joshi AD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Lindström S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Huesing A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Barrdahl M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="VanderWeele TJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Campa D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Canzian F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Gaudet MM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Figueroa JD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Baglietto L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Berg CD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Buring JE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Chanock SJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Chirlaque MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Diver WR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Dossus L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Giles GG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Haiman CA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Hankinson SE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Henderson BE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Hoover RN" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Hunter DJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Isaacs C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Kaaks R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="24" name="Kolonel LN" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Krogh V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Le Marchand L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Lee IM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Lund E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="McCarty CA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Peeters PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Schumacher F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Severi G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Stram DO" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Sund M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Thun MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Travis RC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Trichopoulos D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Willett WC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Zhang S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Ziegler RG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Kraft P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="44" name="Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3)" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25255808</PMID><DOI>10.1093/aje/kwu214</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KST>C055</KST><KEYWORD>LIFE-STYLE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PREDICTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEALTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONFER SUSCEPTIBILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMMON VARIANTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>14Q24.1 RAD51L1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALLELES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BASE-LINE CHARACTERISTICS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LOCI</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>55595</publishedID><Artikel>Inflammatory dysregulation of blood monocytes in Parkinson's disease patients</Artikel><Journal>Acta Neuropathologica</Journal><ABSTr>Despite extensive effort on studying inflammatory processes in the CNS of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, implications of peripheral monocytes are still poorly understood. Here, we set out to obtain a comprehensive picture of circulating myeloid cells in PD patients. We applied a human primary monocyte culture system and flow cytometry-based techniques to determine the state of monocytes from PD patients during disease. We found that the classical monocytes are enriched in the blood of PD patients along with an increase in the monocyte-recruiting chemoattractant protein CCL2. Moreover, we found that monocytes from PD patients display a pathological hyperactivity in response to LPS stimulation that correlates with disease severity. Inflammatory pre-conditioning was also reflected on the transcriptome in PD monocytes using next-generation sequencing. Further, we identified the CD95/CD95L as a key regulator for the PD-associated alteration of circulating monocytes. Pharmacological neutralization of CD95L reverses the dysregulation of monocytic subpopulations in favor of non-classical monocytes. Our results suggest that PD monocytes are in an inflammatory predisposition responding with hyperactivation to a "second hit". These results provide the first direct evidence that circulating human peripheral blood monocytes are altered in terms of their function and composition in PD patients.

We evaluated the association between dietary intakes of total and subclasses of flavonoids and lignans and risk of bladder cancer and its main morphological type, urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC), within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study.

Methods: A cohort of 477 312 men and women mostly aged 35-70 years, were recruited in 10 European countries. At baseline, dietary flavonoid and lignan intakes were estimated using centre-specific validated questionnaires and a food composition database based on the Phenol-Explorer, the UK Food Standards Agency and the US Department of Agriculture databases.

Results: During an average of 11 years of follow-up, 1575 new cases of primary bladder cancer were identified, of which 1425 were UCC (classified into aggressive (n = 430) and non-aggressive (n = 413) UCC). No association was found between total flavonoid intake and bladder cancer risk. Among flavonoid subclasses, significant inverse associations with bladder cancer risk were found for intakes of flavonol (hazard ratio comparing fifth with first quintile (HRQ5-Q1) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.61-0.91; P-trend = 0.009) and lignans (HRQ5-Q 10.78, 95% CI: 0.62-0.96; P-trend = 0.046). Similar results were observed for overall UCC and aggressive UCC, but not for non-aggressive UCC.

Conclusions: Our study suggests an inverse association between the dietary intakes of flavonols and lignans and risk of bladder cancer, particularly aggressive UCC.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>111 (9), 1870-1880</Feld596><PubVol>111</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>1870</StrtPage><EndPage>1880</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Zamora-Ros, R."

Although vaccines against HPV infection are commercially available, they are neither affordable nor accessible to women in low income countries e.g. Africa. Thus, alternative cost-effective vaccine production approaches need to be developed. This study uses tobacco plants to express pentameric capsomeres of HPV that have been reported to generate elevated immune responses against HPV. A modified HPV-16 L1 (L1_2xCysM) protein has been expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione-S-transferase (GST) in tobacco chloroplasts following biolistic transformation. In total 7 transplastomic lines with healthy phenotypes were generated. Site specific integration of the GST-L1_2xCysM and aadA genes was confirmed by PCR. Southern blot analysis verified homogenous transformation of all transplastomic lines. Antigen capture ELISA with the conformation-specific antibody Ritti01, showed protein expression as well as the retention of immunogenic epitopes of L1 protein. In their morphology, GST-L1 expressing tobacco plants were identical to wild type plants and yielded fertile flowers. Taken together, these data enrich knowledge for future development of cost-effective plant-made vaccines against HPV.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>10 (10), 2975-2982</Feld596><PubVol>10</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>2975</StrtPage><EndPage>2982</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hassan SW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Waheed MT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Mueller M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Clarke JL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Shinwari ZK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Loessl AG" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25483463</PMID><DOI>10.4161/21645515.2014.970973</DOI><KST>F035</KST><KEYWORD>CYTOTOXIC T-LYMPHOCYTES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUSTAINED EFFICACY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Transplastomic tobacco</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VIRUS-LIKE PARTICLES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INVASIVE CERVICAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS TYPE-16</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>2ND-GENERATION VACCINES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSGENE CONTAINMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HIGHER-PLANTS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>55840</publishedID><Artikel>Current perspectives on HPV vaccination: a focus on targeting the L2 protein</Artikel><Journal>Future Virology</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (7), 633-653</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>633</StrtPage><EndPage>653</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Seitz H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Mueller M" IsDKFZ="1"/><KST>F035</KST></row><row><publishedID>55852</publishedID><Artikel>Influence of human papillomavirus and p16INK4a on treatment outcome of patients with anal cancer</Artikel><Journal>Radiology and Oncology</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>113 (3), 331-336</Feld596><PubVol>113</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>331</StrtPage><EndPage>336</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Koerber,SA."

Data on the clinical implications of these findings as to whether these mutations define a unique CRC entity with distinct clinical outcome are lacking. We performed Sanger sequencing of the POLE exonuclease domain in 431 well-characterized patients with microsatellite stable (MSS) CRCs of a population-based patient cohort. Mutation data were analyzed for associations with major epidemiological, clinical, genetic, and pathological parameters including overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). In 373 of 431 MSS CRC, all exons of the exonuclease domain were analyzable. Fifty-four mutations were identified in 46 of these samples (12.3%). Besides already reported EDMs, we detected many new mutations in exons 13 and 14 (corresponding to amino acids 410-491) as well as in exon 9 and exon 11 (corresponding to aa 268-303 and aa 341-369). However, we did not see any significant associations of EDMs with clinicopathological parameters, including sex, age, tumor location and tumor stage, CIMP, KRAS, and BRAF mutations. While with a median follow-up time of 5.0 years, survival analysis of the whole cohort revealed nonsignificantly different adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.35 (95% CI: 0.82-2.25) and 1.44 (0.81-2.58) for OS and DSS indicating slightly impaired survival of patients with EDMs, subgroup analysis for patients with stage III/IV disease receiving chemotherapy revealed a statistically significantly increased adjusted HR (1.87; 95% CI: 1.02-3.44). In conclusion, POLE EDMs do not appear to define an entirely new clinically distinct disease entity in CRC but may have prognostic or predictive implications in CRC subgroups, whose significance remains to be investigated in future studies.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>3 (6), 1527-1538</Feld596><PubVol>3</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>1527</StrtPage><EndPage>1538</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Stenzinger, A."

Mutations in the genes encoding the lipoxygenases 12R-LOX and eLOX-3 are the second most common cause of ARCIs. In recent years, human skin equivalents recapitulating the ARCI phenotype have been established.

Objectives To develop a murine organotypic tissue culture model for ARCI.

Methods Epidermal keratinocytes were isolated from newborn 12R-LOX-deficient mice and cocultivated with mouse dermal fibroblasts embedded in a scaffold of native collagen type I.

Results With this experimental set-up the keratinocytes formed a well-organized multilayered stratified epithelium resembling skin architecture in vivo. All epidermal layers were present and the keratinocytes within showed the characteristic morphological features. Markers for differentiation and maturation indicated regular epidermal morphogenesis. The major components of epidermal structures were expressed, and were obviously processed and assembled properly. In contrast to their wild-type counterparts, 12R-LOX-deficient skin equivalents showed abnormal vesicular structures in the upper epidermal layers correlating with altered lipid composition and increased transepidermal water loss, comparable with 12R-LOX-deficient mice.

Conclusions The mouse skin equivalents faithfully recapitulate the 12R-LOX-deficient phenotype observed in vivo, classifying them as appropriate in vitro models to study molecular mechanisms involved in the development of ARCI and to evaluate novel therapeutic agents. In contrast to existing human three-dimensional skin models, the generation of these murine models is not constrained by a limited supply of material and does not depend on in vitro expansion and/or genetic manipulations that could result in inadvertent genotypic and phenotypic alterations.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>171 (6), 1347-1357</Feld596><PubVol>171</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>1347</StrtPage><EndPage>1357</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Rosenberger,S."

Due to the stable integration of retroviral vectors, integration sites can be used to study the clonal fate of individual cells and their progeny. LAM- PCR for the first time provided evidence that leukemia in gene therapy treated patients originated from provirus induced overexpression of a neighboring proto-oncogene. The high sensitivity and specificity of LAM-PCR compared to existing methods like inverse PCR and ligation mediated (LM)-PCR is achieved by an initial preamplification step (linear PCR of 100 cycles) using biotinylated vector specific primers which allow subsequent reaction steps to be carried out on solid phase (magnetic beads). LAM-PCR is currently the most sensitive method available to identify unknown DNA which is located in the proximity of known DNA. Recently, a variant of LAM-PCR has been developed that circumvents restriction digest thus abrogating retrieval bias of integration sites and enables a comprehensive analysis of provirus locations in host genomes. The following protocol explains step-by-step the amplification of both 3'- and 5'- sequences adjacent to the integrated lentiviral vector.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596> (88), e51543-</Feld596><PubVol/><PubIss>88</PubIss><StrtPage>e51543</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Gabriel R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Kutschera I" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bartholomae CC" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="von Kalle C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schmidt M" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24998871</PMID><DOI>10.3791/51543</DOI><KST>G100</KST><KEYWORD>MUSCLE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SCID-X1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VECTOR INTEGRATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LENTIVIRAL VECTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SLEEPING-BEAUTY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>55947</publishedID><Artikel>Parent-of-origin-specific allelic associations among 106 genomic loci for age at menarche</Artikel><Journal>Nature</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>514 (7520), 92-97</Feld596><PubVol>514</PubVol><PubIss>7520</PubIss><StrtPage>92</StrtPage><EndPage>97</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="John,R.B."

Since infections are, however, not only causes of death but risk factors for diseases like cardiovascular diseases, it is essential to monitor and analyze their prevalence and frequency, especially in consideration of the increased life expectancy. To gain more knowledge about infectious diseases as risk factors and their implications on the condition and change of the immune status, the German National Cohort (GNC), a population-based prospective cohort study, will recruit 200,000 subjects between 2014 and 2017. In Pretest 1, a feasibility study for the GNC, we evaluated a self-administered and self-report questionnaire on infectious diseases and on the use of health care facilities (hereinafter called "ID Screen") for feasibility and validity.

From August-November 2011, 435 participants between the ages of 20-69 completed the ID Screen. All subjects had been recruited via a random sample from the local residents' registration offices by 4 of the 18 participating study centers. The questionnaire encompasses 77 variables in six sections assessing items such as 12-month prevalence of infections, cumulative prevalence of infectious diseases, visit of health care facilities and vaccination. The feasibility was amongst others evaluated by assessing the completeness and comprehensiveness of the questionnaire. To assess the questionnaires ability to measure "immune status" and "susceptibility to infections", multivariate analysis was used.

The overall practicability was good and most items were well understood, demonstrated by &lt; 2/33 missing questions per questionnaire and only three variables: vaccination for influenza and pneumococci and infection with chickenpox had a frequency &gt; 5 % of missing values. However, direct comparison of the items 12-month prevalence and lifetime prevalence of nephritis/pyelitis showed poor agreement and thereby poor understanding by 80 % of the participants, illustrating the necessity for a clear, lay person appropriate description of rare diseases to increase comprehensibility. The questionnaire will be used to support the assessment of immune dysfunction and frequency of infection. An analysis of these constructs in an exploratory factor analysis revealed limited applicability due to low interitem correlation (Cronbach's alpha &lt; 0.5). This is corroborated by the extraction of more than one factor with a Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of 0.6 instead of a unidimensional latent construct for "immune status".

All in all, the ID Screen is a good and reliable tool to measure infectious diseases as risk factors and outcome in general, but requires a better translation of infection specific terms into lay person terms. For the assessment of the overall immune status, the tool has strong limitations. Vaccinations status should also rather be assessed based on vaccination certificates than on participants' recall.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>57 (11), 1283-1291</Feld596><PubVol>57</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>1283</StrtPage><EndPage>1291</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Sievers, C."

The aim of this study was to develop a healthy lifestyle index (HLI) composed of five potentially modifiable lifestyle factors healthy weight, physical activity, non-smoking, limited alcohol consumption and a healthy diet, and to explore the association of this index with CRC incidence using data collected within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort.

Methods: In the EPIC cohort, a total of 347,237 men and women, 25- to 70-years old, provided dietary and lifestyle information at study baseline (1992 to 2000). Over a median follow-up time of 12 years, 3,759 incident CRC cases were identified. The association between a HLI and CRC risk was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression models and population attributable risks (PARs) have been calculated.

Results: After accounting for study centre, age, sex and education, compared with 0 or 1 healthy lifestyle factors, the hazard ratio (HR) for CRC was 0.87 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.44 to 0.77) for two factors, 0.79 (95% CI: 0.70 to 0.89) for three factors, 0.66 (95% CI: 0.58 to 0.75) for four factors and 0.63 (95% CI: 0.54 to 0.74) for five factors; P-trend &lt;0.0001. The associations were present for both colon and rectal cancers, HRs, 0.61 (95% CI: 0.50 to 0.74; P for trend &lt;0.0001) for colon cancer and 0.68 (95% CI: 0.53 to 0.88; P-trend &lt;0.0001) for rectal cancer, respectively (P-difference by cancer sub-site = 0.10). Overall, 16% of the new CRC cases (22% in men and 11% in women) were attributable to not adhering to a combination of all five healthy lifestyle behaviours included in the index.

Conclusions: Combined lifestyle factors are associated with a lower incidence of CRC in European populations characterized by western lifestyles. Prevention strategies considering complex targeting of multiple lifestyle factors may provide practical means for improved CRC prevention.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>12 (1), Art.Nr.: 168-</Feld596><PubVol>12</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>Art.Nr.: 168</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Aleksandrova, K."

We investigated biomarkers of one-carbon metabolism and RCC onset and survival.

Methods The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) recruited 385 747 participants with blood samples between 1992 and 2000, and this analysis included 556 RCC case-control pairs. A subsequent replication study included 144 case-control pairs nested within the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS). Plasma concentrations of vitamin B2, vitamin B6, folate, vitamin B12, methionine and homocysteine were measured in prediagnostic samples and evaluated with respect to RCC risk using conditional and unconditional logistic regression models, and to all-cause mortality in RCC cases using Cox regression models. All statistical tests were two-sided.

Results EPIC participants with higher plasma concentrations of vitamin B6 had lower risk of RCC, the odds ratio comparing the 4th and 1st quartiles (OR4vs1) being 0.40 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.28 to 0.57, P-trend &lt; .001. We found similar results after adjusting for potential confounders (adjusted P-trend &lt; .001). In survival analysis, the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality in RCC cases when comparing the 4th and 1st quartiles (HR4vs1) of vitamin B6 was 0.57 (95% CI = 0.37 to 0.87, P-trend &lt; .001). Subsequent replication of these associations within the MCCS yielded very similar results for both RCC risk (OR4vs1 = 0.47, 95% CI = 0.23 to 0.99, P-trend = .07) and all-cause mortality (HR4vs1 = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.27 to 1.17, P-trend = .02). No association was evident for the other measured biomarkers.

Conclusion Study participants with higher circulating concentrations of vitamin B6 had lower risk of RCC and improved survival following diagnosis in two independent cohorts.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>106 (12), dju327-</Feld596><PubVol>106</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>dju327</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Johansson, M."

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study was approved by the institutional ethics board. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Magnetic resonance neurography was performed at 3.0 T by using proton density- and T2-weighted relaxometry and DTI on elbows in 30 healthy subjects without clinical evidence of neuropathy. Quantitative analysis of ulnar nerve T2 and fractional anisotropy (FA) was performed, and T2 and FA values were correlated to electrical nerve conduction velocities (NCVs) with Pearson correlation analysis. Additional qualitative assessment of T2-weighted and FA images was performed by two readers, and sensitivity and specificity were calculated. RESULTS: Ten of the 30 subjects (33%) had NCV slowing across the elbow segment. Compared with subjects without NCV slowing, subjects with slowing had decreased FA values (0.51 +/- 0.09 vs 0.41 +/- 0.07, respectively; P = .006) and increased T2 values (64.2 msec +/- 10.9 vs 76.2 msec +/- 13.7, respectively; P = .01) in the proximal ulnar sulcus. FA values showed a significant correlation (P = .01) with NCV slowing over the sulcus as an electrophysiologic indicator of myelin sheath damage. Qualitative assessment of FA maps and T2-weighted images helped identify subjects with conduction slowing with a sensitivity of 80% and 55%, respectively, and a specificity of 83% and 63%. CONCLUSION: FA maps can accurately depict even mild peripheral neuropathy and perform better than the current standard of reference, T2-weighted images. DTI may therefore add diagnostic value as a highly sensitive technique for the detection of peripheral neuropathy.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>273 (1), 185-193</Feld596><PubVol>273</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>185</StrtPage><EndPage>193</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Baeumer P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Pham M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Ruetters M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Heiland S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Heckel A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Radbruch A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Bendszus M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Weiler M" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24844471</PMID><DOI>10.1148/radiol.14132837</DOI><KST>G370</KST><KST>E012</KST><KEYWORD>regeneration</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRACTOGRAPHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CARPAL-TUNNEL-SYNDROME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONDUCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>extremities</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MEDIAN NERVE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MR NEUROGRAPHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ULNAR NEUROPATHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ELBOW</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>56239</publishedID><Artikel>Head and neck cancer relapse after chemoradiotherapy correlates with CD163+ macrophages in primary tumour and CD11b+ myeloid cells in recurrences</Artikel><Journal>British Journal of Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: We investigated the prognostic role of tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT). METHODS: The expression of CD68+, CD163+ and CD11b+ cells was assessed using immunohistochemistry in n=106 pre-treatment tumour biopsy samples and was correlated with clinicopathological characteristics, including T-stage, N-stage, grading, tumour localisation, age and sex as well as local failure-free survival (LFFS), distant metastases-free survival (DMFS), progression-free (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Finally, TAMs expression and vessel density (CD31) were examined in n=12 available early local recurrence samples and compared with their matched primary tumours . The diagnostic images and radiotherapy plans of these 12 patients were also analysed. All local recurrences occurred in the high radiation dose region (70 Gy). RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 40 months, OS at 2 years was 60.5%. High CD163 expression in primary tumours was associated with decreased OS (P=0.010), PFS (P=0.033), LFFS (P=0.036) and DMFS (P=0.038) in multivariate analysis. CD163 demonstrated a strong prognostic value only in human papillomavirus (p16(INK4))-negative patients. Early local recurrence specimens demonstrated a significantly increased infiltration of CD11b+ myeloid cells (P=0.0097) but decreased CD31-positive vessel density (P=0.0004) compared with their matched primary samples. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, baseline CD163 expression predicts for an unfavourable clinical outcome in HNSCC after definitive CRT. Early local recurrences showed increased infiltration by CD11b+ cells. These data provide important insight on the role of TAMs in mediating response to CRT in patients with HNSCC.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>111 (8), 1509-1518</Feld596><PubVol>111</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>1509</StrtPage><EndPage>1518</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Balermpas P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Rodel F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Liberz R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Oppermann J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Wagenblast J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Ghanaati S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Harter PN" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Mittelbronn M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Weiss C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Roedel C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Fokas E" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25093488</PMID><DOI>10.1038/bjc.2014.446</DOI><KST>L501</KST><KEYWORD>PROGNOSTIC-SIGNIFICANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BREAST-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>carcinoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>radiotherapy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MACROPHAGES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ORAL-CAVITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUPPRESSOR-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>oropharyngeal cancer</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMMUNE-SYSTEM</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>56241</publishedID><Artikel>Specific detection of methionine 27 mutation in histone 3 variants (H3K27M) in fixed tissue from high-grade astrocytomas</Artikel><Journal>Acta Neuropathologica</Journal><ABSTr>Studies in pediatric high-grade astrocytomas (HGA) by our group and others have uncovered recurrent somatic mutations affecting highly conserved residues in histone 3 (H3) variants. One of these mutations leads to analogous p.Lys27Met (K27M) mutations in both H3.3 and H3.1 variants, is associated with rapid fatal outcome, and occurs specifically in HGA of the midline in children and young adults. This includes diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (80 %) and thalamic or spinal HGA (&gt;90 %), which are surgically challenging locations with often limited tumor material available and critical need for specific histopathological markers. Here, we analyzed formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from 143 pediatric HGA and 297 other primary brain tumors or normal brain. Immunohistochemical staining for H3K27M was compared to tumor genotype, and also compared to H3 tri-methylated lysine 27 (H3K27me3) staining, previously shown to be drastically decreased in samples carrying this mutation. There was a 100 % concordance between genotype and immunohistochemical analysis of H3K27M in tumor samples. Mutant H3K27M was expressed in the majority of tumor cells, indicating limited intra-tumor heterogeneity for this specific mutation within the limits of our dataset. Both H3.1 and H3.3K27M mutants were recognized by this antibody while non-neoplastic elements, such as endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells or lymphocytes, did not stain. H3K27me3 immunoreactivity was largely mutually exclusive with H3K27M positivity. These results demonstrate that mutant H3K27M can be specifically identified with high specificity and sensitivity using an H3K27M antibody and immunohistochemistry. Use of this antibody in the clinical setting will prove very useful for diagnosis, especially in the context of small biopsies in challenging midline tumors and will help orient care in the context of the extremely poor prognosis associated with this mutation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>128 (5), 733-741</Feld596><PubVol>128</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>733</StrtPage><EndPage>741</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Bechet D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Gielen GG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Korshunov A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Pfister SM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Rousso C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Faury D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Fiset PO" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Benlimane N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Lewis PW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Lu C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="David Allis C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Kieran MW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Ligon KL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Pietsch T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Ellezam B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Albrecht S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Jabado N" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25200321</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00401-014-1337-4</DOI><KST>G380</KST><KST>B062</KST><KEYWORD>medulloblastoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISTINCT SUBGROUPS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SOMATIC MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PEDIATRIC GLIOBLASTOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTRINSIC PONTINE GLIOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATING ACVR1 MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>K27M MUTATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>H3F3A</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>56244</publishedID><Artikel>Senescence-associated release of transmembrane proteins involves proteolytic processing by ADAM17 and microvesicle shedding</Artikel><Journal>FASEB Journal</Journal><ABSTr>Cellular senescence, a state of persistent cell cycle arrest, has emerged as a potent tumor suppressor mechanism by restricting proliferation of cells at risk for neoplastic transformation. Senescent cells secrete various growth factors, cytokines, and other proteins that can either elicit the clearance of tumor cells or potentially promote tumor progression. In addition, this senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) includes various factors that are synthesized as transmembrane precursors and subsequently converted into their soluble counterparts. Despite the importance of the SASP to tumor biology, it is virtually unknown how transmembrane proteins are released from senescent cancer cells. Here we show in different models of senescence that the metalloprotease A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) is activated and releases the epidermal growth factor receptor ligand amphiregulin and tumor necrosis factor receptor I (TNFRI) from the surface of senescent cells by ectodomain shedding. ADAM17 activation involves phosphorylation of its cytoplasmic tail by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38. Interestingly, unlike amphiregulin and TNFRI, full-length intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) is released from senescent cells by microvesicles independently of ADAM17. Thus, our results suggest that transmembrane proteins can be released by two distinct mechanisms and point to a crucial role for ADAM17 in shaping the secretory profile of senescent cells.-Effenberger, T., von der Heyde, J., Bartsch, K., Garbers, C., Schulze-Osthoff, K., Chalaris, A., Murphy, G., Rose-John, S., Rabe, B.

Targeting ErbBs by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) may therefore limit esophageal cancer cell migration. Here, we studied the impact of TKIs on ErbB dimerization, cell signaling pathways, and cell migration in three esophageal cell lines: OE21 (ESCC), OE33 (EAC), and Het-1A (non-neoplastic esophageal epithelium). In OE21 cells, the TKIs erlotinib, gefitinib, and lapatinib slightly affected epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR/EGFR, but not EGFR/HER2 dimerization as detected by in situ proximity ligation assay (in situ PLA). Still, TKIs inhibited ERK1/2, Akt, STAT3, and RhoA activity in OE21 cells, as assessed by Western blot, antibody arrays, and Rho GTPase effector pull-down assays. This was accompanied by reduced OE21 cell migration, induction of focal adhesions, and actin cytoskeleton reorganization, as shown by Oris migration assay and focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/phalloidin staining. In contrast, in OE33 cells, only lapatinib decreased STAT5, Src family kinase (SFK), and FAK activity as well as beta-catenin expression. This impeded cell migration and induced morphological changes in OE33 cells. No alterations were seen for the non-neoplastic Het-1A cells. Thus, we identified the ErbB signaling network as regulator of esophageal cancer cell's actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesions, and cell migration. ErbB targeted TKIs therefore also limit ESCC and EAC cell motility and migration. KEY MESSAGE: * Clinical tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) reduce esophageal cancer cell migration. * Loss of cell migration is linked to reduced Akt, ERK1/2, STAT (3 or 5), FAK, SFKs, and RhoA activity. * Clinical TKIs act via distinct signaling in the two main histotypes of esophageal cancer.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>92 (11), 1209-1223</Feld596><PubVol>92</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>1209</StrtPage><EndPage>1223</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Fichter CD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Gudernatsch V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Przypadlo CM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Follo M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schmidt G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Werner M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Lassmann S" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25091467</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00109-014-1187-5</DOI><KST>L601</KST><KEYWORD>focal adhesion kinase</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EGFR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RHO-GTPASES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OVEREXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>gene amplification</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LINES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DOWN-REGULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH-FACTOR RECEPTOR</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>56248</publishedID><Artikel>Arabinogalactan protein 31 (AGP31), a putative network-forming protein in Arabidopsis thaliana cell walls?</Artikel><Journal>Annals of Botany</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Arabinogalactan protein 31 (AGP31) is a remarkable plant cell-wall protein displaying a multi-domain organization unique in Arabidopsis thaliana: it comprises a predicted signal peptide (SP), a short AGP domain of seven amino acids, a His-stretch, a Pro-rich domain and a PAC (PRP-AGP containing Cys) domain. AGP31 displays different O-glycosylation patterns with arabinogalactans on the AGP domain and Hyp-O-Gal/Ara-rich motifs on the Pro-rich domain. AGP31 has been identified as an abundant protein in cell walls of etiolated hypocotyls, but its function has not been investigated thus far. Literature data suggest that AGP31 may interact with cell-wall components. The purpose of the present study was to identify AGP31 partners to gain new insight into its function in cell walls. METHODS: Nitrocellulose membranes were prepared by spotting different polysaccharides, which were either obtained commercially or extracted from cell walls of Arabidopsis thaliana and Brachypodium distachyon. After validation of the arrays, in vitro interaction assays were carried out by probing the membranes with purified native AGP31 or recombinant PAC-V5-6xHis. In addition, dynamic light scattering (DLS) analyses were carried out on an AGP31 purified fraction. KEY RESULTS: It was demonstrated that AGP31 interacts through its PAC domain with galactans that are branches of rhamnogalacturonan I. This is the first experimental evidence that a PAC domain, also found as an entire protein or a domain of AGP31 homologues, can bind carbohydrates. AGP31 was also found to bind methylesterified polygalacturonic acid, possibly through its His-stretch. Finally, AGP31 was able to interact with itself in vitro through its PAC domain. DLS data showed that AGP31 forms aggregates in solution, corroborating the hypothesis of an auto-assembly. CONCLUSIONS: These results allow the proposal of a model of interactions of AGP31 with different cell-wall components, in which AGP31 participates in complex supra-molecular scaffolds. Such scaffolds could contribute to the strengthening of cell walls of quickly growing organs such as etiolated hypocotyls.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>114 (6), 1087-1097</Feld596><PubVol>114</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>1087</StrtPage><EndPage>1097</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hijazi M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Roujol D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Nguyen-Kim H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Del Rocio Cisneros Castillo L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Saland E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Jamet E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Albenne C" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24685714</PMID><DOI>10.1093/aob/mcu038</DOI><KST>F010</KST><KEYWORD>DOMAIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CROSS-LINKING</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IDENTIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PLANTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METAL-BINDING</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HYDROXYPROLINE-RICH GLYCOPROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXTENSIN PEROXIDASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POLLEN TUBES</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>56250</publishedID><Artikel>Nuclear relocation of STAT6 reliably predicts NAB2-STAT6 fusion for the diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumour</Artikel><Journal>Histopathology</Journal><ABSTr>AIMS: Nuclear relocation of STAT6 has been shown in tumours with NAB2-STAT6 fusion, and has been proposed as an ancillary marker for the diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumours (SFTs). The aim of this study was to verify the utility of STAT6 immunohistology in diagnosing SFT. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 689 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumours comprising 35 pleural SFTs and 654 other mesenchymal tumours were investigated for STAT6 expression using immunohistochemistry. Nine dedifferentiated liposarcomas (DDLSs) and five SFTs were also examined for the presence of NAB2-STAT6 fusion at the protein level using the proximity ligation assay (PLA), and for copy number variants (CNVs) with the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation450 array. Thirty-four of 35 SFTs showed strong nuclear STAT6 expression. Furthermore, five of 68 DDLSs, two of 130 undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas and one of 63 cases of nodular fasciitis showed moderate to strong nuclear STAT6 expression. The PLA indicated the presence of NAB2-STAT6 fusion protein in SFTs, but signal was also detected in some DDLSs. Copy number analysis showed an overall low frequency of chromosomal imbalances in SFTs, but complex karyotypes in DDLSs, including amplification of STAT6 and MDM2 loci. CONCLUSIONS: The detection of nuclear relocation of STAT6 with immunohistochemistry is a characteristic of SFTs, and may serve as a diagnostic marker that indicates NAB2-STAT6 fusion and helps to discriminate SFTs from histological mimics.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>65 (5), 613-622</Feld596><PubVol>65</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>613</StrtPage><EndPage>622</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Koelsche C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Schweizer L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Renner M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Warth A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Jones DT" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Sahm F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Reuss DE" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Capper D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Knoesel T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Schulz B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Petersen I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Ulrich A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Renker EK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Lehner B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Pfister SM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Schirmacher P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="von Deimling A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="17" name="Mechtersheimer G" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24702701</PMID><DOI>10.1111/his.12431</DOI><KST>G380</KST><KST>B062</KST><KEYWORD>LIPOMATOUS HEMANGIOPERICYTOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NODULAR FASCIITIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIPOSARCOMAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DEFINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SPECTRUM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COPY-NUMBER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHROMOSOMAL IMBALANCES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SARCOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>56251</publishedID><Artikel>Oxyphil Cell Metaplasia in the Parathyroids Is Characterized by Somatic Mitochondrial DNA Mutations in NADH Dehydrogenase Genes and Cytochrome c Oxidase Activity-Impairing Genes</Artikel><Journal>American Journal of Pathology</Journal><ABSTr>Oxyphil cell transformation of epithelial cells due to the accumulation of mitochondria occurs often during cellular aging. To understand the pathogenic mechanisms, we studied mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) alterations in the three cell types of the parathyroids using multiplex real-time PCR and next-generation sequencing. mtDNA was analyzed from cytochrome c oxidase (COX)-positive and COX-negative areas of 19 parathyroids. Mitochondria-rich pre-oxyphil/oxyphil cells were more prone to develop COX defects than the mitochondria-poor clear chief cells (P &lt; 0.001). mtDNA increased approximately 2.5-fold from clear chief to oxyphil cells. In COX deficiency, the increase was even more pronounced, and COX-negative oxyphil cells had approximately two times more mtDNA than COX-positive oxyphil cells (P &lt; 0.001), illustrating the influence of COX deficiency on mtDNA biosynthesis, probably as a consequence of insufficient ATP synthesis. Next-generation sequencing revealed a broad spectrum of putative pathogenic mtDNA point mutations affecting NADH dehydrogenase and COX genes as well as regulatory elements of mtDNA. NADH dehydrogenase gene mutations preferentially accumulated in COX-positive pre-oxyphil/oxyphil cells and, therefore, could be essential for inducing oxyphil cell transformation by increasing mtDNA/mitochondrial biogenesis. In contrast, COX-negative cells predominantly harbored mutations in the MT-CO1 and MT-CO3 genes and in regulatory mtDNA elements, but only rarely NADH dehydrogenase mutations. Thus, multiple hits in NADH dehydrogenase and COX activity-impairing genes represent the molecular basis of oxyphil cell transformation in the parathyroids.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>184 (11), 2922-2935</Feld596><PubVol>184</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>2922</StrtPage><EndPage>2935</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Mueller-Hocker J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Schafer S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Krebs S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Blum H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Zsurka G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Kunz WS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Prokisch H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Seibel P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Jung A" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25418474</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.ajpath.2014.07.015</DOI><KST>L701</KST><KEYWORD>CLONAL EXPANSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STEM-CELL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INDIVIDUAL CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POINT MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMPLEX-I</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RESPIRATORY-CHAIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA NEURONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMMON DELETION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RENAL ONCOCYTOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MTDNA MUTATIONS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>56252</publishedID><Artikel>Key role of MIF in the migration of endothelial progenitor cells in patients during cardiac surgery</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Cardiology</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>181C (), 284-287</Feld596><PubVol>181C</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>284</StrtPage><EndPage>287</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Emontzpohl,C."

MIF is quasi-constitutively expressed by a variety of different cells and tissues, including immune cells such as T-cells and monocytes/macrophages, but also non-immune cells like certain endocrine cells and cells lining interior body cavities or contacting the exterior environment, such as endothelial cells (ECs), or epithelial cells in kidney, gut and skin. Contrary to its historic name, MIF has a direct chemokine-like function and promotes `directed' cell migration (i.e. chemotaxis) and plays a prominent role in inflammatory and atherogenic leukocyte recruitment. At the molecular level, these activities are based on a non-cognate interaction between MIF and the CXC chemokine receptors CXCR2 and CXCR4. Importantly, MIF also interacts with surface CD74, a type II transmembrane protein, inducing its phosphorylation and the recruitment of CD44, leading ultimately to ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Multiple studies have pointed to the utility of MIF as a biomarker for different diseases that have an inflammatory component; these include systemic infections and sepsis, cancer, autoimmune diseases as well as different metabolic disorders. In this Review, we highlight the suitability of MIF and CD74 as biomarkers for different disease applications.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>14 (14), 1125-1131</Feld596><PubVol>14</PubVol><PubIss>14</PubIss><StrtPage>1125</StrtPage><EndPage>1131</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Grieb,G."

These molecular machines hydrolyze ATP to translocate or evict nucleosomes, and establish loci with regularly and more irregularly spaced nucleosomes as well as nucleosome-depleted regions. The impact of nucleosome repositioning on the three-dimensional chromatin structure is only poorly understood. Here, we address this issue by using a coarse-grained computer model of arrays of 101 nucleosomes considering several chromatin fiber models with and without linker histones, respectively. We investigated the folding of the chain in dependence of the position of the central nucleosome by changing the length of the adjacent linker DNA in basepair steps. We found in our simulations that these translocations had a strong effect on the shape and properties of chromatin fibers: i), Fiber curvature and flexibility at the center were largely increased and long-range contacts between distant nucleosomes on the chain were promoted. ii), The highest destabilization of the fiber conformation occurred for a nucleosome shifted by two basepairs from regular spacing, whereas effects of linker DNA changes of ?10 bp in phase with the helical twist of DNA were minimal. iii), A fiber conformation can stabilize a regular spacing of nucleosomes inasmuch as favorable stacking interactions between nucleosomes are facilitated. This can oppose nucleosome translocations and increase the energetic costs for chromatin remodeling. Our computational modeling framework makes it possible to describe the conformational heterogeneity of chromatin in terms of nucleosome positions, and thus advances theoretical models toward a better understanding of how genome compaction and access are regulated within the cell.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>107 (9), 2141-2150</Feld596><PubVol>107</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>2141</StrtPage><EndPage>2150</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Mueller O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Kepper N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Schoepflin R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Ettig R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Rippe K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Wedemann G" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25418099</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.bpj.2014.09.026</DOI><KST>B066</KST><KEYWORD>ANGSTROM RESOLUTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-SITU</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DYNAMICS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMPUTER-SIMULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CORE PARTICLE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RELATE 2 SETS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DOUBLE HELIX</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>56256</publishedID><Artikel>Amplification and overexpression of CMET is a common event in brain metastases of non-small cell lung cancer</Artikel><Journal>Histopathology</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: CMET represents an emerging therapy target for monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Neither CMET expression nor CMET gene amplification status correlated with patient outcome parameters or known prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: CMET overexpression and CMET amplification are commonly found in NSCLC BM and may represent a promising therapeutic target.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>65 (5), 684-692</Feld596><PubVol>65</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>684</StrtPage><EndPage>692</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Preusser M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Streubel B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Berghoff AS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Hainfellner JA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="von Deimling A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Widhalm G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Dieckmann K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Wohrer A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Hackl M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Zielinski C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Birner P" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25039982</PMID><DOI>10.1111/his.12475</DOI><KST>G380</KST><KEYWORD>TUMOR REGISTRY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE COPY NUMBER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>C-MET</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EGFR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>protein expression</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>carcinoma</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>56257</publishedID><Artikel>NK1.1+ CD8+ T cells escape TGF-beta control and contribute to early microbial pathogen response</Artikel><Journal>Nature Communications</Journal><ABSTr>Following microbial pathogen invasion, one of the main challenges for the host is to rapidly control pathogen spreading to avoid vital tissue damage. Here we report that an effector CD8(+) T-cell population that expresses the marker NK1.1 undergoes delayed contraction and sustains early anti-microbial protection. NK1.1(+) CD8(+) T cells are derived from CD8(+) T cells during priming, and their differentiation is inhibited by transforming growth factor-beta signalling. After their own contraction phase, they form a distinct pool of KLRG1 CD127 double-positive memory T cells and rapidly produce both interferon-gamma and granzyme B, providing significant pathogen protection in an antigen-independent manner within only a few hours. Thus, by prolonging the CD8(+) T-cell response at the effector stage and by expressing exacerbated innate-like features at the memory stage, NK1.1(+) cells represent a distinct subset of CD8(+) T cell that contributes to the early control of microbial pathogen re-infections.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>5 (), 5150-</Feld596><PubVol>5</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>5150</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Ruiz AL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Soudja SM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Deceneux C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Lauvau G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Marie JC" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25284210</PMID><DOI>10.1038/ncomms6150</DOI><KST>V040</KST><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANTIGEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIFFERENTIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MEMORY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EFFECTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HOMEOSTASIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTECTIVE IMMUNITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IL-15</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>56261</publishedID><Artikel>The Minute Virus of Mice NS2 proteins are not essential for productive infection of embryonic murine cells in utero</Artikel><Journal>Virology</Journal><ABSTr>The P4 promoter of the autonomous parvovirus Minute Virus of Mice (MVM) drives the production of its non-structural proteins, NS1 and NS2. The NS2 isoforms are without enzymatic activity but interact with cellular proteins. While NS2 is crucial to the viral life cycle in cultured murine cells, NS2-null mutant virus productively infects transformed host cells of other species. In the mouse, sensitivity to MVM infection is age dependent, exhibiting limited subclinical infections in adults, but sustained and potentially lethal infection in embryos. We therefore questioned whether the species-dependent requirement for NS2 function in vitro would be retained in utero. We report here that it is not. NS2-null mutant MVMp is capable of mounting a productive, albeit much reduced, infection of normal embryonic mouse cells in vivo. Based on the data, we hypothesize that NS2 may bear an as-yet undescribed immunosuppressive function.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>468-470 (), 631-636</Feld596><PubVol>468-470</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>631</StrtPage><EndPage>636</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Tal S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Mincberg M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Rostovsky I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Rommelaere J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Salome N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Davis C" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25310499</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.virol.2014.08.032</DOI><KST>F010</KST><KEYWORD>NUCLEAR EXPORT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MVM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SMALL NONSTRUCTURAL PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AUTONOMOUS PARVOVIRUSES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IDENTIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA-REPLICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPORT FACTOR CRM1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTERACTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SEQUENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NS-1 POLYPEPTIDE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>56263</publishedID><Artikel>CD82 Restrains Pathological Angiogenesis by Altering Lipid Raft Clustering and CD44 Trafficking in Endothelial Cells</Artikel><Journal>Circulation</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Angiogenesis is crucial for many pathological processes and becomes a therapeutic strategy against diseases ranging from inflammation to cancer. The regulatory mechanism of angiogenesis remains unclear. Although tetraspanin CD82 is widely expressed in various endothelial cells (ECs), its vascular function is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: Angiogenesis was examined in Cd82-null mice with in vivo and ex vivo morphogenesis assays. Cellular functions, molecular interactions, and signaling were analyzed in Cd82-null ECs. Angiogenic responses to various stimuli became markedly increased upon Cd82 ablation. Major changes in Cd82-null ECs were enhanced migration and invasion, likely resulting from the upregulated expression of cell adhesion molecules such as CD44 and integrins at the cell surface and subsequently elevated outside-in signaling. Gangliosides, lipid raft clustering, and CD44-membrane microdomain interactions were increased in the plasma membrane of Cd82-null ECs, leading to less clathrin-independent endocytosis and then more surface presence of CD44. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals that CD82 restrains pathological angiogenesis by inhibiting EC movement, that lipid raft clustering and cell adhesion molecule trafficking modulate angiogenic potential, that transmembrane protein modulates lipid rafts, and that the perturbation of CD82-ganglioside-CD44 signaling attenuates pathological angiogenesis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>130 (17), 1493-1504</Feld596><PubVol>130</PubVol><PubIss>17</PubIss><StrtPage>1493</StrtPage><EndPage>1504</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Wei Q" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Zhang F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Richardson MM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Roy NH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Rodgers W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Liu Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Zhao W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Fu C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Ding Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Huang C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Chen Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Sun Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Ding L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Hu Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Ma JX" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Boulton ME" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Pasula S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Wren JD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Tanaka S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="19" name="Huang X" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Thali M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Haemmerling GJ" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="22" name="Zhang XA" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25149363</PMID><DOI>10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.114.011</DOI><KST>D050</KST><KEYWORD>ALPHA-3-BETA-1-INTEGRIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>cytoskeleton</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INVOLVEMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VEGF</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTEGRINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STABILIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VASCULAR MORPHOGENESIS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>56264</publishedID><Artikel>BRAF inhibitor-associated ERK activation drives development of chronic lymphocytic leukemia</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Clinical Investigation</Journal><ABSTr>Patients with BRAFV600E/K-driven melanoma respond to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib due to subsequent deactivation of the proliferative RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. In BRAF WT cells and those with mutations that activate or result in high levels of the BRAF activator RAS, BRAF inhibition can lead to ERK activation, resulting in tumorigenic transformation. We describe a patient with malignant melanoma who developed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in the absence of RAS mutations during vemurafenib treatment. BRAF inhibition promoted patient CLL proliferation in culture and in murine xenografts and activated MEK/ERK in primary CLL cells from additional patients. BRAF inhibitor-driven ERK activity and CLL proliferation required B cell antigen receptor (BCR) activation, as inhibition of the BCR-proximal spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) reversed ERK hyperactivation and proliferation of CLL cells from multiple patients, while inhibition of the BCR-distal Bruton tyrosine kinase had no effect. Additionally, the RAS-GTP/RAS ratio in primary CLL cells exposed to vemurafenib was reduced upon SYK inhibition. BRAF inhibition increased mortality and CLL expansion in mice harboring CLL xenografts; however, SYK or MEK inhibition prevented CLL proliferation and increased animal survival. Together, these results suggest that BRAF inhibitors promote B cell malignancies in the absence of obvious mutations in RAS or other receptor tyrosine kinases and provide a rationale for combined BRAF/MEK or BRAF/SYK inhibition.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>124 (11), 5074-5084</Feld596><PubVol>124</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>5074</StrtPage><EndPage>5084</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Yaktapour N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Meiss F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Mastroianni J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Zenz T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Andrlova H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Mathew NR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Claus R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Hutter B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Froehling S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Brors B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Pfeifer D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Pantic M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Bartsch I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Spehl TS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Meyer PT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Duyster J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="16" name="Zirlik K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Brummer T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Zeiser R" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25329694</PMID><DOI>10.1172/JCI76539</DOI><KST>B080</KST><KST>G100</KST><KST>G200</KST><KEYWORD>B-RAF</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMPROVED SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OPEN-LABEL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MEK INHIBITION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DABRAFENIB</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NON-HODGKIN-LYMPHOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRIAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METASTATIC MELANOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>proliferation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RAF INHIBITORS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>56268</publishedID><Artikel>Pulsed versus continuous application of the prodrug 5-fluorocytosine to enhance the oncolytic effectiveness of a measles vaccine virus armed with a suicide gene</Artikel><Journal>Human Gene Therapy. Clinical Development</Journal><ABSTr>Abstract Oncolytic virotherapy with measles vaccine virus (MeV) already has been demonstrated to be safe. However, early clinical results pointed out the necessity for an enhancement of oncolytic effectiveness of MeV-based virotherapeutics. In our work, we are developing an armed measles vaccine virus (MeV-SCD) encoding a suicide fusion gene of yeast cytosine deaminase/uracil phosphoribosyltransferase, converting the nontoxic prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) to the chemotherapeutic drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). To preclinically investigate what an optimal prodrug-assisted therapeutic regimen might look like, we added 5-FC at various time points after infection with MeV-SCD and either let the prodrug remain in the tumor cell culture medium continuously for various time periods ("continuous" 5-FC application) or applied it only temporarily for defined shorter periods of time ("pulsed" 5-FC application); we also varied the time point at which 5-FC was added after infection with MeV-SCD. As a result, addition of the prodrug at early times postinfection (e.g., at 3 hr postinfection) was found to be inferior concerning the overall oncolytic effectiveness when compared with addition of 5-FC at later time points (e.g., at 24 hr postinfection). Next, oncolytic effectiveness was found to correlate positively with the overall duration of incubation of MeV-infected tumor cells with 5-FC. Of note, this was true despite our finding that addition of the prodrug could also exert an inhibitory effect on the generation of infectious progeny viral particles, that is, on virus replication. These findings should be helpful for the rational design of further trials (preclinical, clinical) using suicide gene armed virotherapeutics, such as MeV-SCD.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>25 (2), 85-96</Feld596><PubVol>25</PubVol><PubIss>2</PubIss><StrtPage>85</StrtPage><EndPage>96</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Yurttas C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Berchtold S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Malek NP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Bitzer M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Lauer UM" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24933569</PMID><DOI>10.1089/humc.2013.127</DOI><KST>L801</KST><KEYWORD>PHOSPHORIBOSYLTRANSFERASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>carcinoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FUSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VECTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OVARIAN-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADENOVIRUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHASE-I TRIAL</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>56291</publishedID><Artikel>Acinar cell carcinomas of the pancreas: a molecular analysis in a series of 57 cases</Artikel><Journal>Virchows Archiv</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>465 (6), 661-672</Feld596><PubVol>465</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>661</StrtPage><EndPage>672</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Bergmann,F."

Here, we analyzed three consecutive melanoma lesions obtained within one year of developing stage IV disease for their recognition by autologous T cells.

Experimental Design: One skin (Ma-Mel-48a) and two lymph node (Ma-Mel-48b, Ma-Mel-48c) metastases were analyzed for T-cell infiltration. Melanoma cell lines established from the respective lesions were characterized, determining the T-cell-stimulatory capacity, expression of surface molecules involved in T-cell activation, and specific genetic alterations affecting the tumor-T-cell interaction.

Results: Metastases Ma-Mel-48a and Ma-Mel-48b, in contrast with Ma-Mel-48c, were infiltrated by T cells. The T-cell-stimulatory capacity was found to be strong for Ma-Mel-48a, lower for Ma-Mel-48b, and completely abrogated for Ma-Mel-48c cells. The latter proved to be HLA class I-negative due to an inactivating mutation in one allele of the beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) gene and concomitant loss of the other allele by a deletion on chromosome 15q. The same deletion was already present in Ma-Mel-48a and Ma-Mel-48b cells, pointing to an early acquired genetic event predisposing to development of beta 2m deficiency. Notably, the same chronology of genetic alterations was also observed in a second beta 2m-deficient melanoma model.

Conclusion: Our study reveals a progressive loss in melanoma immunogenicity during the course of metastatic disease. The genetic evolvement of T-cell resistance suggests screening tumors for genetic alterations affecting immunogenicity could be clinically relevant in terms of predicting patient responses to T-cell-based immunotherapy.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>20 (24), 6593-6604</Feld596><PubVol>20</PubVol><PubIss>24</PubIss><StrtPage>6593</StrtPage><EndPage>6604</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Sucker,A."

This formalism was originally developed to analyse the binding and unbinding of transcription factors from naked DNA in eubacteria. Although widely used, it has made it difficult to understand the role of energy-dissipating, inverted question markepigenetic inverted question mark mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, nucleosome remodelling and post-translational modification of histones and co-regulators, which act together with transcription factors to regulate gene expression in eukaryotes.ResultsHere, we introduce a graph-based framework which can accommodate non-equilibrium mechanisms. A gene-regulatory system is described as a graph, which specifies the DNA microstates (vertices), the transitions between microstates (edges) and the transition rates (edge labels). The graph yields a stochastic master equation for how microstate probabilities change over time. We show that this framework has broad scope by providing new insights into three very different ad hoc models, of steroid-hormone responsive genes, of inherently-bounded chromatin domains and of the yeast PHO5 gene. We find, moreover, surprising complexity in the regulation of PHO5, which has not yet been experimentally explored, and we show that this complexity is an inherent feature of being away from equilibrium. At equilibrium, microstate probabilities do not depend on how a microstate is reached but, away from equilibrium, each path to a microstate can contribute to its steady-state probability. Systems that are far from equilibrium thereby become history-dependent and the resulting complexity is a fundamental challenge. To begin addressing this, we introduce a graph-based concept of independence, which can be applied to sub-systems that are far from equilibrium, and prove that history-dependent complexity can be circumvented when sub-systems operate independently.ConclusionAs epigenomic data becomes increasingly available, we anticipate that gene function will come to be represented by graphs, as gene structure has been represented by sequences, and that the methods introduced here will provide a broader foundation for understanding how genes work.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>12 (1), Art.

For most primary tumors that commonly metastasize to the CNS, molecular biomarker analyses are recommended in the clinical setting for selection of appropriate targeted therapies. Therapeutic efficacy of some of these agents has been documented in patients with brain metastases, and molecular testing of CNS metastases should be considered in the clinical setting. Here, we summarize the clinically relevant biomarker tests that should be considered in neurosurgical specimens based on the current recommendations of the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) or the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for the most relevant primary tumor types: lung cancer (EGFR mutations, ALK rearrangement, BRAF mutations), breast cancer (HER2 amplification, steroid receptor overexpression), melanoma (BRAF mutations), and colorectal cancer (RAS mutations). Furthermore, we discuss emerging therapeutic targets including novel oncogenic alterations (ROS1 rearrangements, FGFR1 amplifications, CMET amplifications, and others) and molecular features of the tumor microenvironment (including immune-checkpoint molecules such as CTLA4 and PD-1/PD-L1). We also discuss the potential role of advanced biomarker tests such as next-generation sequencing and "liquid biopsies" for patients with CNS metastases.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>128 (6), 879-891</Feld596><PubVol>128</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>879</StrtPage><EndPage>891</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Berghoff AS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Bartsch R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Wohrer A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Streubel B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Birner P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Kros JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Brastianos PK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="von Deimling A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Preusser M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25287912</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00401-014-1350-7</DOI><KST>G380</KST><KEYWORD>OPEN-LABEL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CLINICAL-PRACTICE GUIDELINES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TARGETED THERAPIES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EGFR MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>brain metastases</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FOLLOW-UP</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL LUNG-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTATION-POSITIVE MELANOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HER2-POSITIVE BREAST-CANCER</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>56341</publishedID><Artikel>MAP kinase activity supported by BRAF (V600E) mutation rather than gene amplification is associated with ETV1 expression in melanoma brain metastases</Artikel><Journal>Archives of Dermatological Research</Journal><ABSTr>In primary melanoma, ETV1 transcription factor was suggested to be activated mainly by gene amplification and to promote tumor growth in cooperation with BRAF (V600E) . Aim of this study was to investigate ETV1 expression in human melanoma with a focus on brain metastases. We investigated ETV1 in 68 human melanoma brain metastases using FISH for ETV1 gene (located at chromosome 7p21) and centromere chromosome 7 and immunohistochemistry for ETV1, BRAF (V600E) , and ETV1/BRAF associated proteins pMSK1, pRSK1, pp38, pMEK1/2, MAPKAP kinase 2, CIC, HIF-1alpha and Ki-67. We further studied ETV1 copy number variations in 32 melanoma cell lines from primary and metastatic lesions using array CGH. The influence of the MAP kinase pathway activity on ETV1 mRNA and protein expression under BRAF wild-type and BRAF (V600E) conditions were determined in melanoma cell lines using qRT-PCR and Western Blot. No ETV1 high grade amplifications were observed in tissue samples, but low grade ETV1 gene amplifications were found in 7 (10.3 %) melanoma brain metastases. ETV1 protein expression in tissue samples (15 %) correlated with BRAF (V600E) status (p = 0.007) and HIF-1alpha expression (p = 0.049), but not with ETV1 gene dose. Application of the BRAF(V600E)-specific inhibitor vemurafenib and the BRAF(V6ooE/V600K)-inhibitor dabrafenib revealed predominant regulation of ETV-1 mRNA and protein via MAPK-pathway. ETV1 expression is a rare event in human melanoma and seems to be rather based on hyperactivation of MAPK signals, by BRAF (V600E) mutation, than on ETV1 gene amplification. Consequently, therapeutic inhibition of BRAF and the downstream MAPK pathway also down-regulates oncogenic ETV1 expression.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>306 (10), 873-884</Feld596><PubVol>306</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>873</StrtPage><EndPage>884</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Birner P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Berghoff AS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Dinhof C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Pirker C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Capper D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Schoppmann SF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Petzelbauer P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="von Deimling A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Berger W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Preusser M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25073704</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00403-014-1490-6</DOI><KST>G380</KST></row><row><publishedID>56348</publishedID><Artikel>First case of disseminated cryptococcosis in a Gorilla gorilla</Artikel><Journal>Mycoses</Journal><ABSTr>In humans, Cryptococcus mainly infects individuals with HIV infection or other types of immunosuppression.

Recurrence and progression of disease occurs in 15-20% of standard risk and 30-40% of high risk patients. We analysed whether circumvention of chemoresistance pathways (drug export, DNA repair and apoptotic inhibition) can restore chemotherapeutic efficacy in a panel of MB cell lines. RESULTS: We demonstrate, by immunohistochemistry in patient tissue microarrays, that ABCB1 is expressed in 43% of tumours and is significantly associated with high-risk. We show that ABCB1, O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) and BCL2 family members are differentially expressed (by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting and flow cytometry) in MB cell lines. Based on these findings, each pathway was then inhibited or circumvented and cell survival assessed using clonogenic assays. Inhibition of ABCB1 using vardenafil or verapamil resulted in a significant increase in sensitivity to etoposide in ABCB1-expressing MB cell lines. Sensitivity to temozolomide (TMZ) was MGMT-dependent, but two novel imidazotetrazine derivatives (N-3 sulfoxide and N-3 propargyl TMZ analogues) demonstrated &gt;/=7 fold and &gt;/=3 fold more potent cytotoxicity respectively compared to TMZ in MGMT-expressing MB cell lines. Activity of the BAD mimetic ABT-737 was BCL2A1 and ABCB1 dependent, whereas the pan-BCL2 inhibitor obatoclax was effective as a single cytotoxic agent irrespective of MCL1, BCL2, BCL2A1, or ABCB1 expression. CONCLUSIONS: ABCB1 is associated with high-risk MB; hence, inhibition of ABCB1 by vardenafil may represent a valid approach in these patients. Imidazotetrazine analogues of TMZ and the BH3 mimetic obatoclax are promising clinical candidates in drug resistant MB tumours expressing MGMT and BCL2 anti-apoptotic members respectively.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>2 (), 57-</Feld596><PubVol>2</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>57</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Othman RT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Kimishi I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bradshaw TD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Storer LC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Korshunov A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Pfister SM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Grundy RG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Kerr ID" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Coyle B" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24887326</PMID><DOI>10.1186/2051-5960-2-57</DOI><KST>G380</KST><KST>B062</KST></row><row><publishedID>56354</publishedID><Artikel>D-2-Hydroxyglutarate producing neo-enzymatic activity inversely correlates with frequency of the type of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 mutations found in glioma</Artikel><Journal>Acta Neuropathologica Communications</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: IDH mutations frequently occur in diffuse gliomas and result in a neo-enzymatic activity that results in reduction of alpha-ketoglutarate to D-2-hydroxyglutarate. In gliomas, the frequency of IDH1 mutations in codon 132 increases in the order R132L-R132S-R132G-R132C-R132H with R132H constituting more than 90% of all IDH1 mutations. RESULTS: We determined the levels of D-2-hydroxyglutarate in glioma tissues with IDH1 mutations. D-2-hydroxyglutarate levels increased in the order of R132H-R132C-R132S/R132G/R132L. We expressed and purified IDH1 wild type and mutant protein for biochemical characterization. Enzyme kinetics of mutant IDH protein correlated well with D-2-hydroxyglutarate production in cells with R132H exhibiting the highest and R132L the lowest KM for alpha-ketoglutarate. Addition of D-2-hydroxyglutarate to the medium of cell lines revealed an inhibitory effect at higher concentrations. Migration of LN229 increased at lower D-2-hydroxyglutarate concentrations while higher concentrations showed no effect. CONCLUSION: These findings may suggest natural selection against the rare IDH1R132 mutations in human glioma due to toxicity caused by high levels of D-2-hydroxyglutarate.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>2 (), 19-</Feld596><PubVol>2</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>19</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Pusch S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Schweizer L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Beck AC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Lehmler JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Weissert S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Balss J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Miller AK" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="von Deimling A" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24529257</PMID><DOI>10.1186/2051-5960-2-19</DOI><KST>G380</KST></row><row><publishedID>56355</publishedID><Artikel>Analysis of IDH mutation, 1p/19q deletion, and PTEN loss delineates prognosis in clinical low-grade diffuse gliomas</Artikel><Journal>Neuro-Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Grades II and III gliomas have unpredictable rates of progression, making management decisions difficult. Currently, several clinical and radiological characteristics are utilized to predict progression and survival but collectively are suboptimal. METHODS: In this study, we analyzed a set of 108 nonenhancing hemispheric grade II-III gliomas. Demographic variables, including patient age, tumor diameter, extent of resection, and performance status, were combined with molecular data (IDH mutation status [mIDH], 1p/19q codeletion, PTEN deletion, and EGFR amplification). A complete dataset for all variables was compiled for 70 of the 108 patients. Both univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to determine whether the molecular data singly or in combination offer advantages over tumor type and grade for prediction of overall survival (OS) and/or progression-free rate (PFR). RESULTS: Patient age, clinical variables (tumor diameter, extent of resection, performance status), and pathology (tumor type and grade) were not predictive of OS or PFR. IDH mutation status alone was predictive of longer OS and PFR for the entire group of tumors; 1p/19q deletion alone was predictive of OS but not PFR. In the multivariable analysis, none of the clinical or demographic factors were predictive of OS or PFR. IDH mutation status, 1p/19q codeletion, and PTEN deletion were predictive of OS (P = .003, P = .005, P = .02, respectively). Both mIDH (P &lt; .001) and the interaction term of 1p/19q and PTEN (P &lt; .001) were found to be predictive of PFR. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the combination of mIDH, 1p/19q codeletion, and PTEN deletion may be particularly effective in discriminating good prognosis from poor prognosis hemispheric gliomas. We propose that such a scheme merits testing on larger prospective cohorts. Should our findings be confirmed, routine clinical analysis of hemispheric gliomas for mIDH, 1p/19q codeletion, and PTEN deletion would be justified.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>16 (7), 914-923</Feld596><PubVol>16</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>914</StrtPage><EndPage>923</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Sabha N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Knobbe CB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Maganti M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Al Omar S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Bernstein M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Cairns R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Cako B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="von Deimling A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Capper D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Mak TW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Kiehl TR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Carvalho P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Garrett E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Perry A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Zadeh G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Guha A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Sidney Croul" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24470545</PMID><KST>G380</KST></row><row><publishedID>56356</publishedID><Artikel>Spinal metastasis of gliosarcoma: Array-based comparative genomic hybridization for confirmation of metastatic spread</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Clinical Neuroscience</Journal><ABSTr>We report a 64-year-old woman who underwent craniotomy and gross total resection of a left frontal lobe tumor initially diagnosed as glioblastoma. Multiple wound revisions were necessary due to repeated wound healing disorders under concomitant radio-chemotherapy. After 9months there was local cranial tumor recurrence, requiring re-operation. Thereafter, temozolomide monotherapy was implemented. Histologically, a shift from glial to mesenchymal differentiation was observed in the recurrent tumor, resulting in the diagnosis of gliosarcoma. A further 9months later a thoracic spinal tumor occurred requiring emergency tumor resection. Analysis showed a mesenchymal tumor without definite glial component. Being resistant to local radiation therapy, symptomatic local spinal tumor progression was observed within 1month requiring re-resection. There was no response to chemotherapy with bevacizumab and irinotecan. Considering the pronounced sarcoma-like differentiation, a sarcoma chemotherapy regime with doxorubicin was initiated. This was also to no avail; the disease progressed and recurred at both the spinal and cerebral locations, respectively. This ambiguous tumor characteristic and therapy resistance encouraged us to retrospectively perform molecular and array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) analysis on the extirpated cerebral and spinal tumors. Tumors from both locations showed a consistent cytogenetic signature of gain of chromosome 7, and losses of chromosomes 10 and 13. This novel report of aCGH analysis of spinal gliosarcoma metastasis and the correlation to the clinical disease course shows that genotypic profiling may serve as a supplementary diagnostic tool in improving our knowledge of the biologic behavior of rare tumor variants.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>21 (11), 1945-1950</Feld596><PubVol>21</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>1945</StrtPage><EndPage>1950</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schindler G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Capper D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Korshunov A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schmieder K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Brenke C" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25065849</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.jocn.2014.03.034</DOI><KST>G380</KST></row><row><publishedID>56423</publishedID><Artikel>Development of bispecific molecules for the in situ detection of protein-protein interactions and protein phosphorylation</Artikel><Journal>Chemistry and Biology</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>21 (3), 357-368</Feld596><PubVol>21</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>357</StrtPage><EndPage>368</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="van Dieck, J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Schmid, V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Heindl, D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Dziadek, S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schraeml, M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Gerg, M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Massoner, P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Engel, A.M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Tiefenthaler, G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Vural, S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Stritt, S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Tetzlaff, F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Soukupova, M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Kopetzki, E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Bossenmaier, B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Thomas, M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Klein, C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Mertens, A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Heller, A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Tacke, M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24529991</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.chembiol.2013.12.018</DOI><KST>A270</KST></row><row><publishedID>56443</publishedID><Artikel>Imputation and subset-based association analysis across different cancer types identifies multiple independent risk loci in the TERT-CLPTM1L region on chromosome 5p15.33</Artikel><Journal>Human Molecular Genetics</Journal><ABSTr>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have mapped risk alleles for at least 10 distinct cancers to a small region of 63 000 bp on chromosome 5p15.33. This region harbors the TERT and CLPTM1L genes; the former encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase reverse transcriptase and the latter may play a role in apoptosis. To investigate further the genetic architecture of common susceptibility alleles in this region, we conducted an agnostic subset-based meta-analysis (association analysis based on subsets) across six distinct cancers in 34 248 cases and 45 036 controls. Based on sequential conditional analysis, we identified as many as six independent risk loci marked by common single-nucleotide polymorphisms: five in the TERT gene (Region 1: rs7726159, P = 2.10 x 10(-39); Region 3: rs2853677, P = 3.30 x 10(-36) and P-Conditional = 2.36 x 10(-8); Region 4: rs2736098, P = 3.87 x 10(-12) and P-Conditional = 5.19 x 10(-6), Region 5: rs13172201, P = 0.041 and P-Conditional = 2.04 x 10(-6); and Region 6: rs10069690, P = 7.49 x 10 215 and P-Conditional = 5.35 x 10(-7)) and one in the neighboring CLPTM1L gene(Region 2: rs451360; P = 1.90 x 10(-18) and P-Conditional = 7.06 x 10(-16)). Between three and five cancers mapped to each independent locus with both risk-enhancing and protective effects. Allele-specific effects on DNA methylation were seen for a subset of risk loci, indicating that methylation and subsequent effects on gene expression may contribute to the biology of risk variants on 5p15.33. Our results provide strong support for extensive pleiotropy across this region of 5p15.33, to an extent not previously observed in other cancer susceptibility loci.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (24), 6616-6633</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>24</PubIss><StrtPage>6616</StrtPage><EndPage>6633</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Wang, Z" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="......"

As the parent virus, they carry out vector genome insertion into the host cell chromatin. Consequently, their preferential integration in transcribed genes raises several conceptual and safety issues. To address part of these questions, HIV-derived vectors have been engineered to be nonintegrating. This was mainly achieved by mutating HIV-1 integrase at functional hotspots of the enzyme enabling the development of streamlined nuclear DNA circles functional for transgene expression. Few integrase mutant vectors have been successfully tested so far for gene transfer. They are cleared with time in mitotic cells, but stable within nondividing retina cells or neurons. Here, we compared six HIV vectors carrying different integrases, either wild type or with different mutations (D64V, D167H, Q168A, K186Q+Q214L+Q216L, and RRK262-264AAH) shown to modify integrase enzymatic activity, oligomerization, or interaction with key cellular cofactor of HIV DNA integration as LEDGF/p75 or TNPO3. We show that these mutations differently affect the transduction efficiency as well as rates and patterns of integration of HIV-derived vectors suggesting their different processing in the nucleus. Surprisingly and most interestingly, we report that an integrase carrying the D167H substitution improves vector transduction efficiency and integration in both HEK-293T and primary CD34+ cells.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>3 (), e213-</Feld596><PubVol>3</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>e213</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Qamar Saeed M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Dufour N, Bartholmae C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Sieranska U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Knopf M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Thierry E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Thierry S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Delelis O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Grandchamp N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Pilet H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Ravassard P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Massonneau J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Pflumio F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="von Kalle C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Lachapelle F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Bemelmans AP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Schmidt M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="16" name="Serguera C" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25462529</PMID><DOI>10.1038/mtna.2014.65</DOI><KST>G100</KST><KEYWORD>TYPE-1 INTEGRASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TERMINAL DOMAIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NONDIVIDING CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NUCLEAR IMPORT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REPLICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PREINTEGRATION COMPLEX-FORMATION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>56499</publishedID><Artikel>Cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and cetuximab (PFE) with or without cilengitide in recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: results of the randomized phase I/II ADVANTAGE trial (phase II part)</Artikel><Journal>Annals of Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (R/M-SCCHN) overexpresses alphavbeta5 integrin. Cilengitide selectively inhibits alphavbeta3 and alphavbeta5 integrins and is investigated as a treatment strategy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The phase I/II study ADVANTAGE evaluated cilengitide combined with cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and cetuximab (PFE) in R/M-SCCHN. The phase II part reported here was an open-label, randomized, controlled trial investigating progression-free survival (PFS). Patients received up to six cycles of PFE alone or combined with cilengitide 2000 mg once (CIL1W) or twice (CIL2W) weekly. Thereafter, patients received maintenance therapy (cilengitide arms: cilengitide plus cetuximab; PFE-alone arm: cetuximab only) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-two patients were treated. Median PFS per investigator read was similar for CIL1W + PFE, CIL2W + PFE, and PFE alone (6.4, 5.6, and 5.7 months, respectively). Accordingly, median overall survival and objective response rates were not improved with cilengitide (12.4 months/47%, 10.6 months/27%, and 11.6 months/36%, respectively). No clinically meaningful safety differences were observed between groups. None of the tested biomarkers (expression of integrins, CD31, Ki-67, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, vascular endothelial-cadherin, type IV collagen, epidermal growth factor receptor, or p16 for human papillomavirus) were predictive of outcome.

In this retrospective analysis of a case series, we evaluated 27 consecutive patients, all of whom required haemodialysis at the time of first-line induction therapy with either bortezomib or a standard regimen followed by high-dose chemotherapy and auto-SCT. The overall response rate was significantly better after bortezomib-based induction before auto-SCT (83% vs 36%, P=0.02) and at day +100 post auto-SCT (100% vs 58%, P=0.01). Bortezomib also prolonged EFS and furthermore, a trend towards a shorter time on haemodialysis was observed in the bortezomib group at a median of 6.1 months (0.2-68.2 months) vs 17.1 months (0.7-94.3 months, P=0.38) in patients who had received vincristine, adriamycin, dexamethasone or vincristine, adriamycin, dexamethasone-like induction regimens. These data demonstrate the superior efficacy of bortezomib-based induction therapy in transplant-eligible patients with end-stage renal failure.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>49 (11), 1371-1375</Feld596><PubVol>49</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>1371</StrtPage><EndPage>1375</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Breitkreutz I" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Heiss C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Perne A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Beimler J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Jaeger D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Egerer G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Ho AD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Neben K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Zeier M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Goldschmidt H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Raab MS" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25089594</PMID><DOI>10.1038/bmt.2014.165</DOI><KST>G330</KST><KST>G170</KST><KST>D120</KST></row><row><publishedID>56507</publishedID><Artikel>Efficacy and safety of trastuzumab-based therapy in combination with different chemotherapeutic regimens in advanced esophagogastric cancer--a single cancer-center experience</Artikel><Journal>Tumori</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Trastuzumab-based therapy has significantly changed the management of Her-2 positive metastatic esophagogastric cancer. However, only limited experience exists for the management in patients who are not suitable for cisplatin-based therapy. METHODS: Patients treated with trastuzumab in combination with different chemotherapeutic regimens were analyzed. Response rates, progression-free survival, overall survival, patterns of cardiac toxicity and patterns of maintenance strategies were recorded. RESULTS: The response rates, progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with metastatic esophagogastric cancer treated with trastuzumab and different chemotherapeutic regimens compared well with the data published in the TOGA trial. No unexpected toxicity occurred. Different strategies were used for therapy de-escalation. CONCLUSION: Trastuzumab-based therapy is effective in combination with several chemotherapeutic regimens with a safe toxicity pattern.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-four patients with progressive MBC were prospectively treated with nab-paclitaxel. Expression of SPARC in tumor cells was assessed by an immunoreactive score, integrating staining intensity and percentage of positive tumor cells; expression in stroma based on staining intensity. SPARC serum levels were determined before 1st and 2nd cycle of nab-paclitaxel and at progression. By applying several cut-offs the association between SPARC expression or serum levels and clinical end-points was analyzed. RESULTS: No clear association between expression of SPARC in primary or metastatic tumor tissue or in serum and any clinical end-point could be detected regardless of the various cut-offs applied. CONCLUSION: Efficacy of nab-paclitaxel in MBC does not seem to be associated with expression of SPARC in tumor tissues or serum.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>34 (11), 6609-15</Feld596><PubVol>34</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>6609</StrtPage><EndPage>15</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schneeweiss A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Seitz J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Smetanay K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schuetz F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Jaeger D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Bachinger A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Zorn M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Sinn HP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Marme F" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25368265</PMID><KST>D120</KST></row><row><publishedID>56512</publishedID><Artikel>Immunonkologie "Coming of Age"-- die nächste Generation der Immun-Checkpoint-Inhibitoren</Artikel><Journal>Oncology Research and Treatment</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>37 Suppl 4 (), 6-9</Feld596><PubVol>37 Suppl 4</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>6</StrtPage><EndPage>9</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schadendorf D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Jaeger D" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25301190</PMID><DOI>10.1159/000366432</DOI><KST>D120</KST></row><row><publishedID>56514</publishedID><Artikel>Influence of interferon-alpha combined with chemo (radio) therapy on immunological parameters in pancreatic adenocarcinoma</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Molecular Sciences</Journal><ABSTr>Prognosis of patients with carcinoma of the exocrine pancreas is particularly poor. A combination of chemotherapy with immunotherapy could be an option for treatment of pancreatic cancer. The aim of this study was to perform an immunomonitoring of 17 patients with pancreatic cancer from the CapRI-2 study, and tumor-bearing mice treated with combination of chemo (radio) therapies with interferon-2alpha. Low doses of interferon-2alpha led to a decrease in total leukocyte and an increase in monocyte counts. Furthermore, we observed a positive effect of interferon-2alpha therapy on the dendritic cells and NK (natural killer) cell activation immediately after the first injection. In addition, we recorded an increased amount of interferon-gamma and IL-10 in the serum following the interferon-2alpha therapy. These data clearly demonstrate that pancreatic carcinoma patients also show an immunomodulatory response to interferon-2alpha therapy. Analysis of immunosuppressive cells in the Panc02 orthotopic mouse model of pancreatic cancer revealed an accumulation of the myeloid-derived suppressor cells in spleens and tumors of the mice treated with interferon-2alpha and 5-fluorouracil. The direct effect of the drugs on myeloid-derived suppressor cells was also registered in vitro. These data expose the importance of immunosuppressive mechanisms induced by combined chemo-immunotherapy.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>15 (3), 4104-25</Feld596><PubVol>15</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>4104</StrtPage><EndPage>25</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Karakhanova S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Mosl B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Harig S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="von Ahn K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Fritz J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Schmidt J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Jaeger D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Werner J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Bazhin AV" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24608924</PMID><DOI>10.3390/ijms15034104</DOI><KST>D120</KST></row><row><publishedID>56515</publishedID><Artikel>Irisin does not mediate resistance training-induced alterations in resting metabolic rate</Artikel><Journal>Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the effects of a 6-month preventive resistance training program on resting metabolic rate (RMR) and its associations with fat-free mass (FFM) and the newly described myokine irisin as two potential mechanistic links between exercise training and RMR. METHODS: In a randomized controlled trial, 74 sedentary healthy male and female participants either completed 6 months of high-repetition resistance training 3 d.wk in accordance with the American College of Sports Medicine recommendations (RT: n = 37; 47 +/- 7 yr; body mass index, 25.0 +/- 3.4 kg.m) or served as controls (CO: n = 37; 50 +/- 7 yr; body mass index, 24.2 +/- 3.2 kg.m). Strength (one-repetition maximum), RMR (indirect calorimetry), body fat (caliper method), and serum irisin concentration (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) were measured before and after 6 months of training. RESULTS: Training led to an increase in strength (one-repetition maximum leg press, 16% +/- 7%; P &lt; 0.001). RMR increased in RT (1671 +/- 356 vs 1843 +/- 385 kcal.d, P &lt; 0.001) but not in CO (1587 +/- 285 vs 1602 +/- 294 kcal.d, P = 0.97; group-time interaction, P &lt; 0.01). Body weight (RT, -0.5 +/- 2.4 kg; CO, 0.1 +/- 2.3 kg), body fat percentage (RT, -1.1% +/- 2.5%; CO, -0.7% +/- 2.9%), and FFM (RT, 0.4 +/- 2.1 kg; CO, 0.6 +/- 1.9 kg) did not develop differently between groups (group-time interaction: P = 0.29, P = 0.54, and P = 0.59, respectively). Serum irisin concentration increased in CO (70.8 +/- 83.4 ng.mL, P &lt; 0.001) but not in RT (22.4 +/- 92.6 ng.mL, P = 0.67; group-time interaction, P &lt; 0.01). The change in RMR was not associated with the change in FFM (r = -0.11, P = 0.36) or irisin (r = -0.004, P = 0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Preventive resistance training elicits an increase in RMR. However, in contrast to currently discussed hypotheses, this increase does not seem to be mediated by training-induced changes in FFM or circulating irisin concentration, which casts doubt in the meaning of irisin for human energy balance.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>46 (9), 1736-43</Feld596><PubVol>46</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>1736</StrtPage><EndPage>43</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Scharhag-Rosenberger F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Meyer T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Wegmann M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Ruppenthal S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kaestner L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Morsch A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Hecksteden A" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24566753</PMID><KST>G110</KST></row><row><publishedID>56516</publishedID><Artikel>Nuclear expression of the deubiquitinase CYLD is associated with improved survival in human hepatocellular carcinoma</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: The deubiquitinase CYLD removes (K-63)-linked polyubiquitin chains from proteins involved in NF-kappaB, Wnt/ss-catenin and Bcl-3 signaling. Reduced CYLD expression has been reported in different tumor entities, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Furthermore, loss of CYLD has been shown to contribute to HCC development in knockout animal models. This study aimed to assess subcellular CYLD expression in tumor tissues and its prognostic significance in HCC patients undergoing liver resection or liver transplantation. METHODS: Subcellular localization of CYLD was assessed by immunohistochemistry in tumor tissues of 95 HCC patients undergoing liver resection or transplantation. Positive nuclear CYLD staining was defined as an immunohistochemical (IHC) score &gt;/= 3. Positive cytoplasmic CYLD staining was defined as an IHC score &gt;/= 6. The relationship with clinicopathological parameters was investigated. Cell culture experiments were performed to analyze subcellular CYLD expression in vitro. RESULTS: Cytoplasmic CYLD expression was observed in 57 out of 95 (60%) HCC specimens (cyt degrees CYLD+). Nuclear CYLD staining was positive in 52 out of 95 specimens (55%, nucCYLD+). 13 out of 52 nucCYLD+ patients (25%) showed a lack of cytoplasmic CYLD expression. nucCYLD+ was associated with prolonged overall survival in patients after resection or liver transplantation (P = 0.007). 5-year overall survival rates were 63% in nucCYLD+ vs. 26% in nucCYLD- patients. Nuclear CYLD staining strongly correlated with tumor grading (P&lt;0.001) and Ki67 positivity (P = 0.005). nucCYLD+ did not prove to be an independent prognostic parameter. In vitro, Huh7, Hep3B and HepG2 showed reduced CYLD levels compared to the non-malignant liver cell line THLE-2. Induction of CYLD expression by doxorubicin treatment led to increased cytoplasmic and nuclear expression of CYLD. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of nuclear CYLD is a novel prognostic factor for improved survival in patients with HCC undergoing liver resection or transplantation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (10), e110591-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>e110591</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Welte S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Urbanik T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Elssner C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kautz N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Koehler BC" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Waldburger N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Bermejo JL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Pinna F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Weiss KH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Schemmer P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Jaeger D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Longerich T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Breuhahn K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Schulze-Bergkamen H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25329885</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0110591</DOI><KST>D120</KST></row><row><publishedID>56518</publishedID><Artikel>Identification of DNA methylation changes at cis-regulatory elements during early steps of HSC differentiation using tagmentation-based whole genome bisulfite sequencing</Artikel><Journal>Cell Cycle</Journal><ABSTr>Epigenetic alterations during cellular differentiation are a key molecular mechanism which both instructs and reinforces the process of lineage commitment. Within the haematopoietic system, progressive changes in the DNA methylome of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are essential for the effective production of mature blood cells. Inhibition or loss of function of the cellular DNA methylation machinery has been shown to lead to a severe perturbation in blood production and is also an important driver of malignant transformation. HSCs constitute a very rare cell population in the bone marrow, capable of life-long self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation. The low abundance of HSCs has been a major technological barrier to the global analysis of the CpG methylation status within both HSCs and their immediate progeny, the multipotent progenitors (MPPs). Within this Extra View article, we review the current understanding of how the DNA methylome regulates normal and malignant hematopoiesis. We also discuss the current methodologies that are available for interrogating the DNA methylation status of HSCs and MPPs and describe a new data set that was generated using tagmentation-based whole genome bisulfite sequencing (TWGBS) in order to comprehensively map methylated cytosines using the limited amount of genomic DNA that can be harvested from rare cell populations. Extended analysis of this data set clearly demonstrates the added value of genome-wide sequencing of methylated cytosines and identifies novel important cis-acting regulatory regions that are dynamically remodeled during the first steps of haematopoietic differentiation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>13 (22), 3476-3487</Feld596><PubVol>13</PubVol><PubIss>22</PubIss><StrtPage>3476</StrtPage><EndPage>3487</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Lipka DB" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Wang Q" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Cabezas-Wallscheid N" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Klimmeck D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Weichenhan D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Herrmann C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Lier A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Brocks D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="von Paleske L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Renders S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Wunsche P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Zeisberger P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Gu L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Haas S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="14" name="Essers MA" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Brors B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="16" name="Eils R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="17" name="Trumpp A*" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="18" name="Milsom MD*" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="19" name="Plass C* (* joint last-authorships)" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25483069</PMID><DOI>10.4161/15384101.2014.973334</DOI><KST>A010</KST><KST>B080</KST><KST>C010</KST><KST>G200</KST><KEYWORD>EPIGENOMIC ANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGENITOR CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC-LEUKEMIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROSTATE-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SELF-RENEWAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CPG ISLANDS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MAMMALIAN DEVELOPMENT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACUTE MYELOID-LEUKEMIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEMATOPOIETIC STEM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-FUNCTION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>56521</publishedID><Artikel>Pathogenic role of the eight probably/possibly carcinogenic HPV types 26, 53, 66, 67, 68, 70, 73 and 82 in cervical cancer</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Pathology</Journal><ABSTr>Eight HPV types (HPV26, 53, 66, 67, 68, 70, 73 and 82) that are phylogenetically closely related to 12 WHO-defined high-risk (HR) HPV have been rarely but consistently identified as single HPV infections in about 3% of cervical cancer (CxCa) tissues. Due to lack of biological data, these types are referred to as probable/possible (p) HR-HPV. To analyse their biological activity in direct comparison to HR-HPV types, we selected 55 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) CxCa tissues harbouring single pHR-HPV infections (2-13 cases per type) and 266 tissues harbouring single HR-HPV (7-40 cases per type) from a worldwide, retrospective, cross-sectional study. Single HPV infection was verified by two genotyping methods. Presence of type-specific spliced E6*I mRNA transcripts and expression of cellular proteins indicative of HPV transformation were assessed in all cases. In 55 CxCa tissues with pHR-HPV, E6*I mRNA expression was 100%; high p16(INK4a) , 98%; low pRb, 96%; low CyD1, 93%; and low p53, 84%. Compared to HPV16 tissues as a reference, individual frequencies of these five markers did not differ significantly, either for any of the eight pHR-HPV and the 11 other HR types individually or for the groups of pHR and HR types without HPV16. We conclude that the eight pHR-HPV types, when present as a single infection in CxCa, are biologically active and affect the same cellular pathways as any of the fully recognized carcinogenic HR-HPV types. Therefore we have provided molecular evidence of carcinogenicity for types currently classified as probably/possibly carcinogenic. Although this evidence is crucial for HPV-type carcinogenicity classification, per se it is not sufficient for inclusion of these HPV types into population-wide primary and secondary prevention programmes. Such decisions have to include careful estimation of effectiveness and cost-benefit analyses. Copyright (c) 2014 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

In zebrafish, loss-of-function alleles have been successfully produced; however, germ line transmission of functional targeted knock-ins of protein tags or of SNP exchanges have not been reported. Here we show by phenotypic rescue that the CRISPR/Cas system can be used to target and repair a premature stop codon at the albino (alb) locus in zebrafish with high efficiency and precision. Using circular donor DNA containing CRISPR target sites we obtain close to 50% of larvae with precise homology-directed repair of the alb(b4) mutation, a small fraction of which transmitted the repaired allele in the germ line to the next generation (3/28 adult fish). The in vivo demonstration of germ line transmission of a precise SNP exchange in zebrafish underscores its suitability as a model for genetic research.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>141 (24), 4827-4830</Feld596><PubVol>141</PubVol><PubIss>24</PubIss><StrtPage>4827</StrtPage><EndPage>4830</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Irion U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Krauss J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Nusslein-Volhard C" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25411213</PMID><KST>D120</KST></row><row><publishedID>56528</publishedID><Artikel>Prognostic impact of CA 19-9 on outcome after neoadjuvant chemoradiation in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer</Artikel><Journal>Annals of Surgical Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: To asses the impact of CA 19-9 and weight loss/gain on outcome after neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CRT) in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC). METHODS: We analyzed 289 patients with LAPC treated with CRT for LAPC. All patients received concomitant chemotherapy parallel to radiotherapy and adjuvant treatments. CA 19-9 and body weight were collected as prognostic and predictive markers. All patients were included into a regular follow-up with reassessment of resectability. RESULTS: Median overall survival in all patients was 14 months. Actuarial overall survival was 37 % at 12 months, 12 % at 24 months, and 4 % at 36 months. Secondary resectability was achieved in 35 % of the patients. R0/R1 resection was significantly associated with increase in overall survival (p = 0.04). Intraoperative radiotherapy was applied in 50 patients, but it did not influence overall survival (p = 0.05). Pretreatment CA 19-9 significantly influenced overall survival using different cutoff values. With increase in CA 19-9 levels, the possibility of secondary surgical resection decreased from 46 % in patients with CA 19-9 levels below 90 U/ml to 31 % in the group with CA 19-9 levels higher than 269 U/ml. DISCUSSION: This large group of patients with LAPC treated with neoadjuvant CRT confirms that CA 19-9 and body weight are strong predictive and prognostic factors of outcome. In the future, individual patient factors should be taken into account to tailor treatment.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>21 (8), 2801-2807</Feld596><PubVol>21</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>2801</StrtPage><EndPage>2807</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Combs SE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Habermehl D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kessel KA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Bergmann F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Werner J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Naumann P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Jaeger D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Buchler MW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Debus J" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24916745</PMID><KST>D120</KST></row><row><publishedID>56531</publishedID><Artikel>Randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate on pain intensity and quality of life in head and neck cancer patients suffering from cetuximab-induced rhagades during radioimmunotherapy: the support trial</Artikel><Journal>BMC Cancer</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Cetuximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Skin reactions are the most common side effects of cetuximab. Rhagades of the tips of the fingers and toes, the heels and especially the interphalangeal joints are one of the most frightening and painful dermatological side effects that may develop from EGFR-inhibitor therapy. Rhagades are characterized by pain, severe tenderness and poor healing response. They are challenging to treat. Thus, rhagades often poses the most significant threat to the quality of life (QoL) for these patients. Ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate (ECA), an ethyl ester of the 2-cyano-2-propenoic acid, is often used as adhesive in a variety of different work settings in industry, i.e. as a component in nail-care products such as nail glue. In addition, ECA is used for various medical indications, such as for liquid bandages and for suture-less surgery. Wound healing can be accelerated with ECA. The purpose of the SUPPORT trial is to investigate the efficacy of ECA for the treatment of cetuximab-induced rhagades and to assess the clinical usefulness of the SUPO score, a new classification system for rhagades induced by EGFR-inhibitor therapy. METHODS/DESIGN: The SUPPORT trial is an open-label, prospective, randomized, national multicenter intervention study to evaluate the effectiveness of ECA versus the standard treatment of each institution on the pain intensity and QoL in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer suffering from painful cetuximab-induced rhagades during radioimmunotherapy. Primary endpoint is the assessment of the pain intensity 24 hours after application of ECA or the standard treatment quantified by the visual analogue scale (VAS). Secondary endpoints are the evaluation of QoL assessed by the EORTC-QoL-C30 questionnaire and the Dermatological Life Quality Index (DLQI). DISCUSSION: During treatment with EGFR inhibitors it is necessary to recognize and manage side effects promptly to assure better patient QoL. The SUPPORT trial is the first randomized clinical trial evaluating a new treatment option for painful cetuximab-induced rhagades. Furthermore, the new SUPO score will be prospectively assessed in terms of clinical usefulness for classification of EGFR inhibitor-induced rhagades.

While cetuximab has been shown to increase response and resection rates, the survival outcome for this conversion strategy needs further evaluation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with technically unresectable and/or &gt;/=5 liver metastases were treated with FOLFOX/cetuximab (arm A) or FOLFIRI/cetuximab (arm B) and evaluated with regard to resectability every 2 months. Tumour response and secondary resection data have been reported previously. A final analysis of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was carried out in December 2012. RESULTS: Between December 2004 and March 2008, 56 patients were randomised to arm A, 55 to arm B. The median OS was 35.7 [95% confidence interval (CI) 27.2-44.2] months [arm A: 35.8 (95% CI 28.1-43.6), arm B: 29.0 (95% CI 16.0-41.9) months, HR 1.03 (95% CI 0.66-1.61), P = 0.9]. The median PFS was 10.8 (95% CI 9.3-12.2) months [arm A: 11.2 (95% CI 7.2-15.3), arm B: 10.5 (95% CI 8.9-12.2) months, HR 1.18 (95% CI 0.79-1.74), P = 0.4]. Patients who underwent R0 resection (n = 36) achieved a better median OS [53.9 (95% CI 35.9-71.9) months] than those who did not [21.9 (95% CI 17.1-26.7) months, P &lt; 0.001]. The median disease-free survival for R0 resected patients was 9.9 (95% CI 5.8-14.0) months, and the 5-year OS rate was 46.2% (95% CI 29.5% to 62.9%). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms a favourable long-term survival for patients with initially sub-optimal or unresectable colorectal liver metastases who respond to conversion therapy and undergo secondary resection. Both FOLFOX/FOLFIRI plus cetuximab, appear to be appropriate regimens for 'conversion' treatment in patients with K-RAS codon 12/13/61 wild-type tumours. Thus, liver surgery can be considered curative or alternatively as an additional 'line of therapy' in those patients who are not cured.

BACKGROUND: HCC is a rare tumor in Germany, but its incidence has increased over the last 30 years. New therapies such as chemoembolization with drug-eluting beads, selective internal radiotherapy, and sorafenib were introduced recently; however, the impact on clinical management and overall survival (OS) is unclear. STUDY: In this retrospective analysis, 1066 patients with HCC, separated into two 6-year periods (n=385; 1998 to 2003 and n=681; 2004 to 2009) were evaluated. RESULTS: The number of patients presenting each year (64 vs. 114 per year), with an age over 80 years or with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis increased significantly between periods. The main risk factors were alcoholic liver disease in 51.7%, chronic hepatitis C virus in 28.2%, and chronic hepatitis B virus in 13.4% of patients with liver cirrhosis and HCC. Patients presented with more advanced tumor stages and with worse liver function in period 2. The majority (61.6%) of patients received local treatment over a spectrum of Barcelona Clinic Liver-Cancer (BCLC) stages, whereas systemic therapy was offered to a minority (8.8%) and limited to BCLC stage C patients only. OS decreased in BCLC stage A and D and improved in BCLC stage B and C and decreased for all patients from 16.5 to 15.3 months between periods. CONCLUSIONS: No improvement of OS was observed when comparing time periods, partly because of the more advanced stage of HCC and because of the increasing age in the second time period. Improved and new therapeutic options and the intensification of surveillance programs are likely to increase survival of HCC patients in the future.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>48 (3), 279-89</Feld596><PubVol>48</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>279</StrtPage><EndPage>89</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Weinmann A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Koch S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Niederle IM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schulze-Bergkamen H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Konig J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hoppe-Lotichius M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Hansen T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Pitton MB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Duber C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Otto G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Schuchmann M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Galle PR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Worns MA" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24045276</PMID><KST>D120</KST></row><row><publishedID>56555</publishedID><Artikel>Unresectable isolated hepatic metastases from solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas: A case report of chemosaturation with high-dose melphalan</Artikel><Journal>Pancreatology</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas (SPN) are rare tumors. For patients with unresectable liver metastases of SPN, no standard treatment has been defined so far. Here we report a case of a 40-year-old woman with SPN and metastases confirmed to the liver, and disease progression in the liver after primary tumor resection and chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin. METHODS: Chemosaturation with percutaneous hepatic perfusions is a minimally invasive, repeatable regional therapy which delivers chemotherapy directly to the liver while limiting systemic toxicity. As an individual treatment approach, the patient was treated with chemosaturation with percutaneous hepatic perfusions of melphalan. RESULTS: The procedure was performed twice within 8 weeks after which the liver metastases showed a marked reduction in size and vascularization (partial response). Grade 3 leukopenia after the second procedure was managed effectively with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. No other toxicities were observed. Ten months after initiating treatment, the patient had a good performance status and remained stable. CONCLUSIONS: For SPN with unresectable liver metastases and progression despite systemic treatment, repeat chemosaturation with high-dose melphalan may also offer an effective regional treatment option.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>14 (6), 546-9</Feld596><PubVol>14</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>546</StrtPage><EndPage>9</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hofmann H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="von Haken R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Werner J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kortes N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Bergmann F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Schemmer P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Jaeger D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Radeleff B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Schulze-Bergkamen H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25280592</PMID><KST>D120</KST></row><row><publishedID>56557</publishedID><Artikel>Adjuvant therapy after resection of colorectal liver metastases: the predictive value of the MSKCC clinical risk score in the era of modern chemotherapy</Artikel><Journal>BMC Cancer</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>14 (), 174-</Feld596><PubVol>14</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>174</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Rahbari NN, Reissfelder C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Schulze-Bergkamen H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Jaeger D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Buchler MW, Weitz J, Koch M" IsDKFZ="0"/><DOI>10.1186/1471-2407-14-174</DOI><KST>D120</KST></row><row><publishedID>56561</publishedID><Artikel>Nebenwirkungsorientierte Behandlungspfade für die bewegungstherapeutische Betreuung von onkologischen Patienten</Artikel><Journal>

METHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 423 previously untreated patients who had unresectable stage IIIC or stage IV melanoma with a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation to receive a combination of dabrafenib (150 mg orally twice daily) and trametinib (2 mg orally once daily) or dabrafenib and placebo. The primary end point was progression-free survival. Secondary end points included overall survival, response rate, response duration, and safety. A preplanned interim overall survival analysis was conducted. RESULTS: The median progression-free survival was 9.3 months in the dabrafenib-trametinib group and 8.8 months in the dabrafenib-only group (hazard ratio for progression or death in the dabrafenib-trametinib group, 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57 to 0.99; P=0.03). The overall response rate was 67% in the dabrafenib-trametinib group and 51% in the dabrafenib-only group (P=0.002). At 6 months, the interim overall survival rate was 93% with dabrafenib-trametinib and 85% with dabrafenib alone (hazard ratio for death, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.94; P=0.02). However, a specified efficacy-stopping boundary (two-sided P=0.00028) was not crossed. Rates of adverse events were similar in the two groups, although more dose modifications occurred in the dabrafenib-trametinib group. The rate of cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma was lower in the dabrafenib-trametinib group than in the dabrafenib-only group (2% vs. 9%), whereas pyrexia occurred in more patients (51% vs. 28%) and was more often severe (grade 3, 6% vs. 2%) in the dabrafenib-trametinib group. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of dabrafenib and trametinib, as compared with dabrafenib alone, improved the rate of progression-free survival in previously untreated patients who had metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations.

Consequently, SOX2 functions as an activator or suppressor of gene transcription. SOX2 has been described as an essential embryonic stem cell gene and moreover, a necessary factor for induced cellular reprogramming. SOX2 research has only recently switched focus from embryogenesis and development to SOX2's function in disease. Particularly, the role of SOX2 in cancer pathogenesis has become of interest in the field. To date, studies have shown SOX2 to be amplified in various cancer types and affect cancer cell physiology via involvement in complicated cell signaling and protein-protein interactions. Recent reviews in this field have highlighted SOX2 in mammalian physiology, development and pathology. In this review, we comprehensively compile what is known to date about SOX2's involvement in cancer biology, focusing on the most recent findings in the fields of cellular signaling and cancer stem cells. Lastly, we underscore the role of SOX2 in the clinic and highlight new findings, which may provide novel clinical applications for SOX2 as a prognostic marker, indicator of metastasis, biomarker or potential therapeutic target in some cancer types.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>3 (), 19-</Feld596><PubVol>3</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>19</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Weina K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Utikal J" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25114775</PMID><DOI>10.1186/2001-1326-3-19</DOI><KST>G300</KST></row><row><publishedID>56731</publishedID><Artikel>Leukocyte count restoration under dabrafenib treatment in a melanoma patient with vemurafenib-induced leukopenia</Artikel><Journal>Medicine</Journal><ABSTr>Recent advances in melanoma therapy have influenced the management of metastatic patients.

Beyond studies that describe miRNAs frequently as markers for specific traits, we asked whether a general pattern for miRNAs across many diseases exists.

Methods: We evaluated genome-wide circulating profiles of 1,049 patients suffering from 19 different cancer and non-cancer diseases as well as unaffected controls. The results were validated on 319 individuals using qRT-PCR.

Results: We discovered 34 miRNAs with strong disease association. Among those, we found substantially decreased levels of hsa-miR-144* and hsa-miR-20b with AUC of 0.751 ( 95% CI: 0.703-0.799), respectively. We also discovered a set of miRNAs, including hsa-miR-155*, as rather stable markers, offering reasonable control miRNAs for future studies. The strong downregulation of hsa-miR-144* and the less variable pattern of hsa-miR-155* has been validated in a cohort of 319 samples in three different centers. Here, breast cancer as an additional disease phenotype not included in the screening phase has been included as the 20th trait.

Conclusions: Our study on 1,368 patients including 1,049 genome-wide miRNA profiles and 319 qRT-PCR validations further underscores the high potential of specific blood-borne miRNA patterns as molecular biomarkers. Importantly, we highlight 34 miRNAs that are generally dysregulated in human pathologies. Although these markers are not specific to certain diseases they may add to the diagnosis in combination with other markers, building a specific signature. Besides these dysregulated miRNAs, we propose a set of constant miRNAs that may be used as control markers.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>12 (1), 224-</Feld596><PubVol>12</PubVol><PubIss>1</PubIss><StrtPage>224</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Keller,A."

It also should put a word of caution into all attempts to summarize criteria for "causality" of infectious agents in cancer development. At least in the opinion of these authors, we would be much better off avoiding these terms, replacing "causal factor" by "risk factor" and grading them according to their contribution to an individual's cancer risk.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>41 (6), 860-875</Feld596><PubVol>41</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>860</StrtPage><EndPage>875</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="zur Hausen, H."

An essential retinoid-metabolizing enzyme known as lecithin retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) is expressed in melanoma cells but not in melanocytes catalysing the esterification of all-trans retinol (ATRol). In this study, we show that a stable LRAT knockdown (KD) in the human melanoma cell line SkMel23 leads to significantly increased levels of the substrate ATRol and biologically active ATRA. LRAT KD restored cellular sensitivity to retinoids analysed in cell culture assays and melanoma 3D skin models. Furthermore, ATRA-induced gene regulatory mechanisms drive depletion of added ATRol in LRAT KD cells. PCR analysis revealed a significant upregulation of retinoid-regulated genes such as CYP26A1 and STRA6 in LRAT KD cells, suggesting their possible involvement in mediating retinoid resistance in melanoma cells. In conclusion, LRAT seems to be important for melanoma progression. We propose that reduction in ATRol levels in melanoma cells by LRAT leads to a disturbance in cellular retinoid level. Balanced LRAT expression and activity may provide protection against melanoma development and progression. Pharmacological inhibition of LRAT activity could be a promising strategy for overcoming retinoid insensitivity in human melanoma cells.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (11), 832-837</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>832</StrtPage><EndPage>837</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Amann PM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Czaja K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bazhin AV" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Ruhl R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Skazik C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Heise R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Marquardt Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Eichmueller SB" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Merk HF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Baron JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25236354</PMID><DOI>10.1111/exd.12548</DOI><KST>D015</KST><KEYWORD>CARCINOMA LINES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SKIN MODELS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VITAMIN-A</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHASE-II</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTERFERON ALPHA-2A</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>REDUCED LECITHIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ORAL-CAVITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METASTATIC MELANOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VITRO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>56994</publishedID><Artikel>Coagulation and angiogenic gene expression profiles are defined by molecular subgroups of medulloblastoma: evidence for growth factor-thrombin cross-talk</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis</Journal><ABSTr>BackgroundThe coagulation system becomes activated during progression and therapy of high-grade brain tumors. Triggering tissue factor (F3/TF) and thrombin receptors (F2R/PAR-1) may influence the vascular tumor microenvironment and angiogenesis irrespective of clinically apparent thrombosis. These processes are poorly understood in medulloblastoma (MB), in which diverse oncogenic pathways define at least four molecular disease subtypes (WNT, SHH, Group 3 and Group 4). We asked whether there is a link between molecular subtype and the network of vascular regulators expressed in MB.

MethodsUsing R2 microarray analysis and visualization platform, we mined MB datasets for differential expression of vascular (coagulation and angiogenesis)-related genes, and explored their link to known oncogenic drivers. We evaluated the functional significance of this link in DAOY cells in vitro following growth factor and thrombin stimulation.

ResultsThe coagulome and angiome differ across MB subtypes. F3/TF and F2R/PAR-1 mRNA expression are upregulated in SHH tumors and correlate with higher levels of hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET). Cultured DAOY (MB) cells exhibit an up-regulation of F3/TF and F2R/PAR-1 following combined SHH and MET ligand (HGF) treatment. These factors cooperate with thrombin, impacting the profile of vascular regulators, including interleukin 1 (IL1B) and chondromodulin 1 (LECT1).

ConclusionsCoagulation pathway sensors (F3/TF, F2R/PAR-1) are expressed in MB in a subtype-specific manner, and may be functionally linked to SHH and MET circuitry.

As vascularization is an important factor for the distribution of drugs in tissues, we analyzed drug distribution as a function of blood vessel localization in tumor tissue. To explore distribution of the anticancer drugs afatinib, erlotinib, and sorafenib, a combined approach of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) drug imaging and immunohistochemical vessel staining was applied and examined by digital image analysis. The following two xenograft models were investigated: (1) mice carrying squamous cell carcinoma (FaDu) xenografts (ntumor = 13) were treated with afatinib or erlotinib, and (2) sarcoma (A673) xenograft bearing mice (ntumor = 8) received sorafenib treatment. MALDI drug imaging revealed a heterogeneous distribution of all anticancer drugs. The tumor regions containing high drug levels were associated with a higher degree of vascularization than the regions without drug signals (p &lt; 0.05). When correlating the impact of blood vessel size to drug abundance in the sarcoma model, a higher amount of small vessels was detected in the tumor regions with high drug levels compared to the tumor regions with low drug levels (p &lt; 0.05). With the analysis of coregistered MALDI imaging and CD31 immunohistochemical data by digital image analysis, we demonstrate for the first time the potential of correlating MALDI drug imaging and immunohistochemistry. Here we describe a specific and precise approach for correlating histological features and pharmacokinetic properties of drugs at microscopic level, which will provide information for the improvement of drug design, administration formula or treatment schemes.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>86 (21), 10568-10575</Feld596><PubVol>86</PubVol><PubIss>21</PubIss><StrtPage>10568</StrtPage><EndPage>10575</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Huber K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Feuchtinger A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Borgmann DM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Li Z" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Aichler M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hauck SM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Zitzelsberger H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Schwaiger M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Keller U" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Walch A" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25263480</PMID><DOI>10.1021/ac502177y</DOI><KST>L701</KST><KEYWORD>ERBB FAMILY BLOCKER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MULTIKINASE INHIBITOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SOLID TUMORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RENAL-CELL CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>receptor tyrosine kinase</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>sorafenib</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>erlotinib</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TREATMENT RESPONSE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISCOVERY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>56998</publishedID><Artikel>Simultaneous assessment of vessel size index, relative blood volume, and vessel permeability in a mouse brain tumor model using a combined spin echo gradient echo echo-planar imaging sequence and viable tumor analysis</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: Combining multiple imaging biomarkers in one magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) session would be beneficial to gain more data pertaining to tumor vasculature under therapy. Therefore, simultaneous measurement of perfusion, permeability, and vessel size imaging (VSI) using a gradient echo spin echo (GE-SE) sequence with injection of a clinically approved gadolinium (Gd)-based contrast agent was assessed in an orthotopic glioma model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A combined spin echo gradient echo echo-planar imaging sequence was implemented using a single contrast agent Gd diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA). This sequence was tested in a mouse brain tumor model (U87_MG), also under treatment with an antiangiogenic agent (bevacizumab). T2 maps and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were used to differentiate regions of cell death and viable tumor tissue. RESULTS: In viable tumor tissue regional blood volume was 5.7 +/- 0.6% in controls and 5.2 +/- 0.3% in treated mice. Vessel size was 18.1 +/- 2.4 mum in controls and 12.8 +/- 2.0 mum in treated mice, which correlated with results from immunohistochemistry. Permeability (K(trans) ) was close to zero in treated viable tumor tissue and 0.062 +/- 0.024 min(-1) in controls. CONCLUSION: Our MRI method allows simultaneous assessment of several physiological and morphological parameters and extraction of MRI biomarkers for vasculature. These could be used for treatment monitoring of novel therapeutic agents such as antiangiogenic drugs.J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2014;40:1310-1318.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: For comparison with ADP, whole-body MR data of 11 volunteers were obtained using a continuously moving table Dixon sequence. Resulting fat images were corrected for B1 related intensity inhomogeneities before fat segmentation. RESULTS: The performed MR measurements of the whole body provided a direct comparison to ADP measurements. The segmentation of subcutaneous and internal fat in the abdomen worked reliably with an accuracy of 98%. Depending on the underlying model for fat quantification, the resultant MR fat masses represent an upper and a lower limit for the true fat masses. In comparison to ADP, the results were in good agreement with rho &gt;/=0.97, P &lt; 0.0001. CONCLUSION: Whole-body fat quantities derived noninvasively by using a continuously moving table Dixon acquisition were directly compared with ADP. The accuracy of the method and the high reproducibility of results indicate its potential for clinical applications. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2014;40:1437-1444.

Small molecule receptor kinase inhibitors (RKIs) have recently been introduced into cancer treatment. However, the influence of these drugs-particularly in combination with radiotherapy-on the survival of MSCs is largely unknown. METHODS: The sensitivity of human primary MSCs from healthy volunteers and primary human fibroblast cells to small molecule kinase inhibitors of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) receptors, as well to inhibitors of c-Kit, was examined in combination with ionizing radiation (IR); cell survival and proliferation were assessed. Expression patterns of different kinase receptors and ligands were investigated using gene arrays. RESULTS: MSCs were highly sensitive to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors SU14816 (imatinib) and SU11657 (sunitinib), but showed only moderate sensitivity to the selective TGFbeta receptor 1 inhibitor LY2109761. Primary adult human fibroblasts were comparably resistant to all three inhibitors. The addition of IR had an additive or supra-additive effect in the MSCs, but this was not the case for differentiated fibroblasts. Proliferation was markedly reduced in MSCs following kinase inhibition, both with and without IR. Gene expression analysis revealed high levels of the PDGF alpha and beta receptors, and lower levels of the TGFbeta receptor 2 and Abl kinase. IR did not alter the expression of kinase receptors or their respective ligands in either MSCs or adult fibroblasts. CONCLUSION: These data show that MSCs are highly sensitive to RKIs and combination treatments incorporating IR. Expression analyses suggest that high levels of PDGF receptors may contribute to this effect.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>190 (11), 1037-1045</Feld596><PubVol>190</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>1037</StrtPage><EndPage>1045</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Nicolay NH" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Sommer E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Perez RL" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Wirkner U" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Bostel T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Ho AD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Lahn M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Debus J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Saffrich R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Huber PE" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>24863573</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00066-014-0686-1</DOI><KST>E050</KST><KST>E055</KST><KEYWORD>TGF-BETA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FACTOR-BETA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH-FACTOR-RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMATINIB MESYLATE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PULMONARY-FIBROSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FRACTIONATED-IRRADIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VITRO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CARCINOMA-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BONE-MARROW</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>57001</publishedID><Artikel>Consumption of predefined 'Nordic' dietary items in ten European countries - an investigation in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort</Artikel><Journal>Public Health Nutrition</Journal><ABSTr>OBJECTIVE: Health-beneficial effects of adhering to a healthy Nordic diet index have been suggested. However, it has not been examined to what extent the included dietary components are exclusively related to the Nordic countries or if they are part of other European diets as well, suggesting a broader preventive potential. The present study describes the intake of seven a priori defined healthy food items (apples/pears, berries, cabbages, dark bread, shellfish, fish and root vegetables) across ten countries participating in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) and examines their consumption across Europe. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. A 24 h dietary recall was administered through a software program containing country-specific recipes. Sex-specific mean food intake was calculated for each centre/country, as well as percentage of overall food groups consumed as healthy Nordic food items. All analyses were weighted by day and season of data collection. SETTING: Multi-centre, European study. SUBJECTS: Persons (n 36 970) aged 35-74 years, constituting a random sample of 519 978 EPIC participants. RESULTS: The highest intakes of the included diet components were: cabbages and berries in Central Europe; apples/pears in Southern Europe; dark bread in Norway, Denmark and Greece; fish in Southern and Northern countries; shellfish in Spain; and root vegetables in Northern and Central Europe. Large inter-centre variation, however, existed in some countries. CONCLUSIONS: Dark bread, root vegetables and fish are strongly related to a Nordic dietary tradition. Apples/pears, berries, cabbages, fish, shellfish and root vegetables are broadly consumed in Europe, and may thus be included in regional public health campaigns.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>17 (12), 2650-2659</Feld596><PubVol>17</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>2650</StrtPage><EndPage>2659</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Roswall N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Olsen A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Boll K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Christensen J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Halkjaer J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Sorensen TI" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Dahm CC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Clavel-Chapelon F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Boutron-Ruault MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Cottet V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Teucher B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Kaaks R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="von Ruesten A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Oikonomou E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Vasilopoulou E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Pala V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Sacerdote C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Mattiello A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Masala G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Peeters PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Engeset D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Skeie G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Asli LA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Amiano P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Jakszyn P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Ardanaz E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Huerta JM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Quiros JR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Molina-Montes E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Nilsson LM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Johansson I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Wirfalt E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Drake I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Mulligan AA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Romaguera D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Vergnaud AC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Key T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24589249</PMID><DOI>10.1017/S1368980014000159</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>PATTERNS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WOMEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MARKERS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROJECT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CALIBRATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MORTALITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADHERENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Mediterranean diet</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>57002</publishedID><Artikel>A next-generation dual-recombinase system for time- and host-specific targeting of pancreatic cancer</Artikel><Journal>Nature Medicine</Journal><ABSTr>Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) have dramatically improved our understanding of tumor evolution and therapeutic resistance. However, sequential genetic manipulation of gene expression and targeting of the host is almost impossible using conventional Cre-loxP-based models. We have developed an inducible dual-recombinase system by combining flippase-FRT (Flp-FRT) and Cre-loxP recombination technologies to improve GEMMs of pancreatic cancer. This enables investigation of multistep carcinogenesis, genetic manipulation of tumor subpopulations (such as cancer stem cells), selective targeting of the tumor microenvironment and genetic validation of therapeutic targets in autochthonous tumors on a genome-wide scale. As a proof of concept, we performed tumor cell-autonomous and nonautonomous targeting, recapitulated hallmarks of human multistep carcinogenesis, validated genetic therapy by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase inactivation as well as cancer cell depletion and show that mast cells in the tumor microenvironment, which had been thought to be key oncogenic players, are dispensable for tumor formation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>20 (11), 1340-1347</Feld596><PubVol>20</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>1340</StrtPage><EndPage>1347</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schoenhuber N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Seidler B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Schuck K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Veltkamp C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schachtler C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Zukowska M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Eser S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Feyerabend TB" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Paul MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Eser P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Klein S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Lowy AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Banerjee R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Yang F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Lee CL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Moding EJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Kirsch DG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Scheideler A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Alessi DR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Varela I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Bradley A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Kind A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Schnieke AE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Rodewald HR" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="24" name="Rad R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="25" name="Schmid RM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="26" name="Schneider G" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="27" name="Saur D" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25326799</PMID><DOI>10.1038/nm.3646</DOI><KST>D110</KST><KST>L701</KST><KEYWORD>DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ADULT MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RAS ONCOGENES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOME-WIDE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MAST-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>K-RAS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOUSE MODEL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>intraepithelial neoplasia</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ONCOGENIC KRAS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>57003</publishedID><Artikel>Investigation of manic and euthymic episodes identifies state- and trait-specific gene expression and STAB1 as a new candidate gene for bipolar disorder</Artikel><Journal>Translational Psychiatry</Journal><ABSTr>Bipolar disorder (BD) is a highly heritable psychiatric disease characterized by recurrent episodes of mania and depression. To identify new BD genes and pathways, the present study employed a three-step approach. First, gene-expression profiles of BD patients were assessed during both a manic and an euthymic phase. These profiles were compared intra-individually and with the gene-expression profiles of controls. Second, those differentially expressed genes that were considered potential trait markers of BD were validated using data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortiums' genome-wide association study (GWAS) of BD. Third, the implicated molecular mechanisms were investigated using pathway analytical methods. In the present patients, this novel approach identified: (i) sets of differentially expressed genes specific to mania and euthymia; and (ii) a set of differentially expressed genes that were common to both mood states. In the GWAS data integration analysis, one gene (STAB1) remained significant (P=1.9 x 10(-4)) after adjustment for multiple testing. STAB1 is located in close proximity to PBMR1 and the NEK4-ITIH1-ITIH3-ITIH4 region, which are the top findings from GWAS meta-analyses of mood disorder, and a combined BD and schizophrenia data set. Pathway analyses in the mania versus control comparison revealed three distinct clusters of pathways tagging molecular mechanisms implicated in BD, for example, energy metabolism, inflammation and the ubiquitin proteasome system. The present findings suggest that STAB1 is a new and highly promising candidate gene in this region. The combining of gene expression and GWAS data may provide valuable insights into the biological mechanisms of BD.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>4 (), e426-</Feld596><PubVol>4</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>e426</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Witt SH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Juraeva D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Sticht C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Strohmaier J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Meier S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Treutlein J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Dukal H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Frank J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Lang M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Deuschle M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Schulze TG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Degenhardt F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Mattheisen M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Brors B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="14" name="Cichon S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Nothen MM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Witt CC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Rietschel M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25136889</PMID><DOI>10.1038/tp.2014.71</DOI><KST>B080</KST><KST>G200</KST><KEYWORD>CONVERGENT FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LITHIUM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>sensitivity</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RELIABILITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SCHIZOPHRENIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BLOOD</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>brain</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Mood Disorders</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METAANALYSIS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>57008</publishedID><Artikel>The C6 configuration and syn/anti conformational preference of the bisulfite adducts of deoxyuridine and deoxycytidine by NMR and DFT calculations</Artikel><Journal>Tetrahedron-Asymmetry</Journal><ABSTr>The configuration at C6 of the epimeric bisulfite adducts of deoxyuridine was determined by means of NMR in conjunction with DFT calculations.

There are currently very few approaches to evaluate the variability of metabolomic data in terms of characteristics of individuals or aspects pertaining to technical processing. To address this issue, a method was developed to identify and quantify the contribution of relevant sources of variation in metabolomic data prior to investigation of etiological hypotheses. The Principal Component Partial R-square (PC-PR2) method combines features of principal component and of multivariable linear regression analyses. Within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC), metabolic profiles were determined by H-1 NMR analysis on 807 serum samples originating from a nested liver cancer case-control study. PC-PR2 was used to quantify the variability of metabolomic profiles in terms of study subjects age, sex, body mass index, country of origin, smoking status, diabetes and fasting status, as well as factors related to sample processing. PC-PR2 enables the evaluation of important sources of variations in metabolomic studies within large-scale epidemiological investigations.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>10 (6), 1074-1083</Feld596><PubVol>10</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>1074</StrtPage><EndPage>1083</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Fages,A."

Genetic ablation of STIL, an essential component of the centriole replication machinery in mammalian cells, causes embryonic lethality in mice around mid gestation associated with defective Hedgehog signaling. Here, we describe, by focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy, that STIL-/- mouse embryos do not contain centrioles or primary cilia, suggesting that these organelles are not essential for mammalian development until mid gestation. We further show that the lack of primary cilia explains the absence of Hedgehog signaling in STIL-/- cells. Exogenous re-expression of STIL or STIL microcephaly mutants compatible with human survival, induced non-templated, de novo generation of centrioles in STIL-/- cells. Thus, while the abscence of centrioles is compatible with mammalian gastrulation, lack of centrioles and primary cilia impairs Hedgehog signaling and further embryonic development.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>13 (18), 2859-2868</Feld596><PubVol>13</PubVol><PubIss>18</PubIss><StrtPage>2859</StrtPage><EndPage>2868</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="David, A."

To assess their role in cerebellar and medulloblastoma (MB) development, we deleted the miR-17 approximately 92 cluster family in Nestin-positive neural progenitors and in mice heterozygous for the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) receptor Patched 1 (Ptch1(+/-)). We show that mice in which we conditionally deleted the miR-17 approximately 92 cluster (miR-17 approximately 92(floxed/floxed); Nestin-Cre(+)) alone or together with the complete loss of the miR-106b approximately 25 cluster (miR-106b approximately 25(-/-)) were born alive but with small brains and reduced cerebellar foliation. Remarkably, deletion of the miR-17 approximately 92 cluster abolished the development of SHH-MB in Ptch1(+/-) mice. Using an orthotopic transplant approach, we showed that granule neuron precursors (GNPs) purified from the cerebella of postnatal day 7 (P7) Ptch1(+/-); miR-106b approximately 25(-/-) mice and overexpressing Mycn induced MBs in the cortices of naive recipient mice. In contrast, GNPs purified from the cerebella of P7 Ptch1(+/-); miR-17 approximately 92(floxed/floxed); Nestin-Cre(+) animals and overexpressing Mycn failed to induce tumors in recipient animals. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the miR-17 approximately 92 cluster is dispensable for cerebellar development, but required for SHH-MB development.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>3 (7), 597-605</Feld596><PubVol>3</PubVol><PubIss>7</PubIss><StrtPage>597</StrtPage><EndPage>605</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Zindy F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Kawauchi D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Lee Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Ayrault O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Ben Merzoug L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="McKinnon PJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Ventura A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Roussel MF" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24928431</PMID><DOI>10.1242/bio.20146734</DOI><KST>B062</KST></row><row><publishedID>57192</publishedID><Artikel>Herbert Steinbeisser: a life with the Xenopus embryo</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Developmental Biology</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>58 (5), 299-302</Feld596><PubVol>58</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>299</StrtPage><EndPage>302</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="De Robertis EM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Niehrs C."

We provide evidence for a role of receptors of the innate immune system in virally induced inflammation of the endothelium in vitro and in vivo. Corresponding to the in vitro finding of an HCV-dependent induction of proinflammatory mediators in endothelial cells, mice treated with poly (I:C) exhibit a significant reduction in leukocyte rolling velocity, an increase in leukocyte adhesion to the vessel wall and an increased extravasation of leukocytes. HCV directly promotes activation, adhesion and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the vessel wall by activation of endothelial viral receptors. Poly (I:C) induces the expression of TLR3 in vivo and hereby allows for amplification of all of the aforementioned responses upon viral infection. Proinflammatory effects of viral RNA are specifically mediated by TLR3 and significantly enhanced by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha). HCV-RNA induces the endothelial expression of TNFalpha and TNFalpha receptor subtype 2 and we provide evidence that leucocyte adhesion and transmigration in response to activation of viral RNA receptors seem to depend on expression of functional TNFR2. Our results demonstrate that endothelial cells actively participate in immune mediated vascular inflammation caused by viral infections.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (11), e113351-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>e113351</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Pircher J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Czermak T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Merkle M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Mannell H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Krotz F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Ribeiro A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Vielhauer V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Nadjiri J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Gaitzsch E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Niemeyer M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Porubsky S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Groene HJ" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Wornle M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25419735</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0113351</DOI><KST>G130</KST><KEYWORD>SYSTEMIC VASCULITIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>glomerulonephritis</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DOUBLE-STRANDED-RNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INFECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR-3</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SERUM-LEVELS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MIXED CRYOGLOBULINEMIA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>57272</publishedID><Artikel>Detection of activated parietal epithelial cells on the glomerular tuft distinguishes early focal segmental glomerulosclerosis from minimal change disease</Artikel><Journal>American Journal of Pathology</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>184 (12), 3239-3248</Feld596><PubVol>184</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>3239</StrtPage><EndPage>3248</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Smeets B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Stucker F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Wetzels J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Brocheriou I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Ronco P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Groene HJ" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="D`, Agati V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Fogo AB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="van Kuppevelt TH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Fischer HP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Boor P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Floege J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Ostendorf T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Moeller MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25307344</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.ajpath.2014.08.007</DOI><KST>G130</KST></row><row><publishedID>57273</publishedID><Artikel>Essential role of sympathetic endothelin A receptors for adverse cardiac remodeling</Artikel><Journal>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</Journal><ABSTr>In preclinical studies, endothelin receptor A (ETA) antagonists (ETAi) attenuated the progression of heart failure (HF). However, clinical HF trials failed to demonstrate beneficial effects of ETAi. These conflicting data may be explained by the possibility that established HF drugs such as adrenergic receptor blockers interfered with the mechanism of ETAi action in clinical trials. Here we report that mice lacking ETA only in sympathetic neurons (SN-KO) showed less adverse structural remodeling and cardiac dysfunction in response to pathological pressure overload induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). In contrast, mice lacking ETA only in cardiomyocytes (CM-KO) were not protected. TAC led to a disturbed sympathetic nerve function as measured by cardiac norepinephrine (NE) tissue levels and [(124)I]-metaiodobenzylguanidine-PET, which was prevented in SN-KO. In a rat model of HF, ETAi improved cardiac and sympathetic nerve function. In cocultures of cardiomyocytes (CMs) and sympathetic neurons (SNs), endothelin-1 (ET1) led to a massive NE release and exaggerated CM hypertrophy compared with CM monocultures. ETA-deficient CMs gained a hypertrophic response through wild-type SNs, but ETA-deficient SNs failed to mediate exaggerated CM hypertrophy. Furthermore, ET1 mediated its effects indirectly via NE in CM-SN cocultures through adrenergic receptors and histone deacetylases, resulting in activation of the prohypertrophic transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2. In conclusion, sympathetic ETA amplifies ET1 effects on CMs through adrenergic signaling pathways. Thus, antiadrenergic therapies may blunt potentially beneficial effects of ETAi. Taken together, this may indicate that patients with beta blocker intolerance or disturbed sympathetic nerve function could be evaluated for a potential benefit from ETAi.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>111 (37), 13499-13504</Feld596><PubVol>111</PubVol><PubIss>37</PubIss><StrtPage>13499</StrtPage><EndPage>13504</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Lehmann LH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Rostosky JS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Buss SJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kreusser MM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Krebs J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Mier W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Enseleit F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Spiger K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Hardt SE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Wieland T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Haass M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Luscher TF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Schneider MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Parlato R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Groene HJ" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Haberkorn U" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="16" name="Yanagisawa M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Katus HA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Backs J" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25197047</PMID><KST>E060</KST><KST>G130</KST><KST>A992</KST></row><row><publishedID>57382</publishedID><Artikel>The role of histone tails in the nucleosome: A computational study</Artikel><Journal>Biophysical Journal</Journal><ABSTr>Histone tails play an important role in gene transcription and expression. We present here a systematic computational study of the role of histone tails in the nucleosome, using replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations with an implicit solvent model and different well-established force fields. We performed simulations for all four histone tails, H4, H3, H2A, and H2B, isolated and with inclusion of the nucleosome. The results confirm predictions of previous theoretical studies for the secondary structure of the isolated tails but show a strong dependence on the force field used. In the presence of the entire nucleosome for all force fields, the secondary structure of the histone tails is destabilized. Specific contacts are found between charged lysine and arginine residues and DNA phosphate groups and other binding sites in the minor and major DNA grooves. Using cluster analysis, we found a single dominant configuration of binding to DNA for the H4 and H2A histone tails, whereas H3 and H2B show multiple binding configurations with an equal probability. The leading stabilizing contribution for those binding configurations is the attractive interaction between the positively charged lysine and arginine residues and the negatively charged phosphate groups, and thus the resulting charge neutralization. Finally, we present results of molecular dynamics simulations in explicit solvent to confirm our conclusions. Results from both implicit and explicit solvent models show that large portions of the histone tails are not bound to DNA, supporting the complex role of these tails in gene transcription and expression and making them possible candidates for binding sites of transcription factors, enzymes, and other proteins.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>107 (12), 2902-2913</Feld596><PubVol>107</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>2902</StrtPage><EndPage>2913</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Erler, J."

Materials and methods: For 221 patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the hypopharynx, oropharynx or oral cavity treated at the 8 partner sites of the German Cancer Consortium, the impact of HPV DNA, p16 overexpression and p53 expression on outcome were retrospectively analysed. The primary endpoint was loco-regional tumour control; secondary endpoints were distant metastases and overall survival.

Results: In the total patient population, univariate analyses revealed a significant impact of HPV16 DNA positivity, p16 overexpression, p53 positivity and tumour site on loco-regional tumour control. Multivariate analysis stratified for tumour site showed that positive HPV 16 DNA status correlated with loco-regional tumour control in patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma (p = 0.02) but not in the oral cavity carcinoma group. Multivariate evaluation of the secondary endpoints in the total population revealed a significant association of HPV16 DNA positivity with overall survival (p &lt; 0.01) but not with distant metastases.

Conclusions: HPV16 DNA status appears to be a strong prognosticator of loco-regional tumour control after postoperative cisplatin-based radiochemotherapy of locally advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma and is now being explored in a prospective validation trial.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>113 (3), 317-323</Feld596><PubVol>113</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>317</StrtPage><EndPage>323</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Lohaus F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Linge A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Tinhofer I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Budach V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Gkika E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Stuschke M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Balermpas P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Rödel C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Avlar M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Grosu AL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Abdollahi A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Debus J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Bayer C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Belka C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Pigorsch S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Combs SE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Mönnich D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Zips D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="von Neubeck C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Baretton GB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Löck S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Thames HD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Krause M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Baumann M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="DKTK-ROG" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25480095</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.radonc.2014.11.011</DOI><KST>E050</KST><KST>E210</KST><KEYWORD>PAPILLOMAVIRUS-POSITIVE HEAD</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OVEREXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SQUAMOUS-CELL CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>p53</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>chemotherapy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>smoking</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>radiotherapy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NECK-CANCER</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>57462</publishedID><Artikel>Experience with afatinib in patients with non-small cell lung cancer progressing after clinical benefit from gefitinib and erlotinib</Artikel><Journal>Oncologist</Journal><ABSTr>Background. Afatinib, an irreversible ErbB family blocker, demonstrated superiority to chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Afatinib is also active in patients progressing on EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). We report the results of a large cohort of NSCLC patients receiving afatinib within a compassionate-use program (CUP).
 
Patients and Methods. Patients with advanced NSCLC progressing after one line or more of chemotherapy and one line or more of EGFR-TKI treatment with either an EGFR mutation or documented clinical benefit were enrolled. Data collection was not monitored or verified by central review. The intention of this CUP was to provide controlled preregistration access to afatinib for patients with life-threatening diseases and no other treatment option.
 
Results. From May 2010 to October 2013, 573 patients (65% female; medianage: 64years [range: 28-89years]) were enrolled, with strong participation of community oncologists. Comorbidities were allowed, including second malignancies in 11% of patients. EGFR mutation status was available in 391 patients (72%), and 83% tested mutation positive. Median time to treatment failure (TTF) of 541 patients treated with afatinib was 3.7 months (range: 0.0 to &gt;29.0 months). Median TTF was 4.0 and 2.7 months in patients with adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas, respectively, and 4.6 months in patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Adverse events were generally manageable.
 
Conclusion. Afatinib was able to be given in areal-world setting to heavily pretreated patients with EGFR-mutated or EGFR-TKI-sensitive NSCLC. Acknowledging the constraints of data collection in a CUP, afatinib appears to be safe and to confer some clinical benefit in this population.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>19 (10), 1100-1109</Feld596><PubVol>19</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>1100</StrtPage><EndPage>1109</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schuler M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Fischer JR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Grohe C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Guetz S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Thomas M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Kimmich M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Schneider CP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Laack E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Maerten A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Afatinib Compassionate Use Consortium" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25232040</PMID><DOI>10.1634/theoncologist.2014-010</DOI><KST>E210</KST><KST>L401</KST><KEYWORD>ACQUIRED-RESISTANCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EGFR MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SUPPORTIVE CARE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>tyrosine kinase inhibitors</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>chemotherapy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRIAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>adenocarcinoma</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DOUBLE-BLIND</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RANDOMIZED PHASE-II</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BIBW 2992</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>57538</publishedID><Artikel>Oncology and Care in Specialized- and Public Media</Artikel><Journal>Onkologe</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>20 (12), 1229-1232</Feld596><PubVol>20</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>1229</StrtPage><EndPage>1232</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Gaisser,A."

Using the method of Western blotting, the expression of CYP1A1, 1B1, 3A4, lactoperoxidase, thyroid peroxidase, cyclooxygenase-1 and cytochrome b(5), the enzymes that catalyze and/or influence ellipticine metabolism, was investigated in several cancer cells sensitive to ellipticine (HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia and T-cell leukemia CCRF-CEM cells, glioblastoma U87MG cells, thyroid cancer BHT-101, B-CPAP and 8505-C cells, neuroblastoma UKF-NB-3 and UKF-NB-4 cell lines and breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells). The findings summarized from several former studies reviewed in this study, together with new results indicate that, depending on individual cells, cytotoxicity of ellipticine, which is mediated by formation of covalent DNA adducts to these cancer cells, is influenced by expression levels of these CYP and peroxidase enzymes in the tested cancer cells. Furthermore, a potency of ellipticine to induce the enzymes dictating activation of ellipticine to form DNA adducts in studied cancer cells determines an increase in cytotoxicity of ellipticine to these tumor cells.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (10), 5675-5689</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>5675</StrtPage><EndPage>5689</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Stiborova,M."

We have reviewed and summarized the published evidence and evaluated the association using individual patient data from multiple case cohorts. METHODS: A MEDLINE search to identify studies published up to January 2013 was performed. We combined published estimates of survival time for "moderate drinkers" versus nondrinkers. An analysis of individual participant data using Cox regression was carried out using data from 11 case cohorts. RESULTS: We identified 11 published studies suitable for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Moderate postdiagnosis alcohol consumption was not associated with overall survival [HR, 0.95; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.85-1.05], but there was some evidence of better survival associated with prediagnosis consumption (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.73-0.88). Individual data on alcohol consumption for 29,239 cases with 4,839 deaths were available from the 11 case cohorts, all of which had data on estrogen receptor (ER) status. For women with ER-positive disease, there was little evidence that pre- or postdiagnosis alcohol consumption is associated with breast cancer-specific mortality, with some evidence of a negative association with all-cause mortality. On the basis of a single study, moderate postdiagnosis alcohol intake was associated with a small reduction in breast cancer-specific mortality for women with ER-negative disease. There was no association with prediagnosis intake for women with ER-negative disease. CONCLUSION: There was little evidence that pre- or post-diagnosis alcohol consumption is associated with breast cancer-specific mortality for women with ER-positive disease. There was weak evidence that moderate post-diagnosis alcohol intake is associated with a small reduction in breast cancer-specific mortality in ER-negative disease. IMPACT: Considering the totality of the evidence, moderate postdiagnosis alcohol consumption is unlikely to have a major adverse effect on the survival of women with breast cancer.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (6), 934-945</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>934</StrtPage><EndPage>945</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ali AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Schmidt MK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bolla MK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Wang Q" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Gago-Dominguez M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Castelao JE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Carracedo A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Garzon VM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Bojesen SE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Nordestgaard BG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Flyger H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Chang-Claude J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Vrieling A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Rudolph A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="14" name="Seibold P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Nevanlinna H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Muranen TA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Aaltonen K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Blomqvist C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Matsuo K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Ito H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Iwata H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Horio A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="John EM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Sherman M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Lissowska J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Figueroa J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Garcia-Closas M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Anton-Culver H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Shah M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Hopper JL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Krogh V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Andersson A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Clavel-Chapelon F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Dossus L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Fagherazzi G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Peeters PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Olsen A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Wishart GC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Easton DF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Borgquist S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="44" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="45" name="Barricarte A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="46" name="Gonzalez CA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="47" name="Sanchez MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="48" name="Amiano P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="49" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="50" name="Key T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="51" name="Pharoah PD" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24636975</PMID><DOI>10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-13-0901</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>PROSPECTIVE COHORT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECURRENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>nutrition</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MORTALITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPIDEMIOLOGY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK-FACTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIETARY FACTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IOWA WOMENS HEALTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECEPTOR STATUS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>57542</publishedID><Artikel>Design of a Highly Effective Therapeutic HPV16 E6/E7-Specific DNA Vaccine: Optimization by Different Ways of Sequence Rearrangements (Shuffling)</Artikel><Journal>PLoS ONE</Journal><ABSTr>Persistent infection with the high-risk Human Papillomavirus type 16 (HPV 16) is the causative event for the development of cervical cancer and other malignant tumors of the anogenital tract and of the head and neck. Despite many attempts to develop therapeutic vaccines no candidate has entered late clinical trials. An interesting approach is a DNA based vaccine encompassing the nucleotide sequence of the E6 and E7 viral oncoproteins. Because both proteins are consistently expressed in HPV infected cells they represent excellent targets for immune therapy. Here we report the development of 8 DNA vaccine candidates consisting of differently rearranged HPV-16 E6 and E7 sequences within one molecule providing all naturally occurring epitopes but supposedly lacking transforming activity. The HPV sequences were fused to the J-domain and the SV40 enhancer in order to increase immune responses. We demonstrate that one out of the 8 vaccine candidates induces very strong cellular E6- and E7- specific cellular immune responses in mice and, as shown in regression experiments, efficiently controls growth of HPV 16 positive syngeneic tumors. This data demonstrates the potential of this vaccine candidate to control persistent HPV 16 infection that may lead to malignant disease. It also suggests that different sequence rearrangements influence the immunogenecity by an as yet unknown mechanism.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (11), e113461-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>e113461</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Almajhdi FN" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Senger T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Amer HM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Gissmann L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Ohlschlager P" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25422946</PMID><DOI>10.1371/journal.pone.0113461</DOI><KST>F020</KST><KEYWORD>NUCLEAR IMPORT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>T-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>E7</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>intraepithelial neoplasia</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS TYPE-16</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CERVICAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GRADE 3</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>II TRIAL</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>57543</publishedID><Artikel>Comparing the biological washout of beta+-activity induced in mice brain after 12C-ion and proton irradiation</Artikel><Journal>Physics in Medicine and Biology</Journal><ABSTr>In clinical ion beam therapy, protons as well as heavier ions such as carbon are used for treatment. For protons, beta(+)-emitters are only induced by fragmentation reactions in the target (target fragmentation), whereas for heavy ions, they are additionally induced by fragmentations of the projectile (further referred to as autoactivation). An approach utilizing these processes for treatment verification, by comparing measured Positron Emission Tomography (PET) data to predictions from Monte Carlo simulations, has already been clinically implemented. For an accurate simulation, it is important to consider the biological washout of beta(+)-emitters due to vital functions. To date, mathematical expressions for washout have mainly been determined by using radioactive beams of (10)C- and (11)C-ions, both beta(+)-emitters, to enhance the counting statistics in the irradiated area. Still, the question of how the choice of projectile (autoactivating or non-autoactivating) influences the washout coefficients, has not been addressed. In this context, an experiment was carried out at the Heidelberg Ion Beam Therapy Center with the purpose of directly comparing irradiation-induced biological washout coefficients in mice for protons and (12)C-ions. To this aim, mice were irradiated in the brain region with protons and (12)C-ions and measured after irradiation with a PET/CT scanner (Siemens Biograph mCT). After an appropriate waiting time, the mice were sacrificed, then irradiated and measured again under similar conditions. The resulting data were processed and fitted numerically to deduce the main washout parameters. Despite the very low PET counting statistics, a consistent difference could be identified between (12)C-ion and proton irradiated mice, with the (12)C data being described best by a two component fit with a combined medium and slow washout fraction of 0.50 +/- 0.05 and the proton mice data being described best by a one component fit with only one (slow) washout fraction of 0.73 +/- 0.06.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>59 (23), 7229-7244</Feld596><PubVol>59</PubVol><PubIss>23</PubIss><StrtPage>7229</StrtPage><EndPage>7244</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ammar C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Frey K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bauer J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Melzig C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Chiblak S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hildebrandt M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Unholtz D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Kurz C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Brons S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Debus J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Abdollahi A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Parodi K" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25383509</PMID><DOI>10.1088/0031-9155/59/23/7229</DOI><KST>E050</KST><KST>E210</KST><KEYWORD>ROOM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISTRIBUTIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PET</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-BEAM</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>57544</publishedID><Artikel>Association between socioeconomic factors and sleep quality in an urban population-based sample in Germany</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Public Health</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Good sleep quality is essential for recovery. The risk factors of sleep disorders have been extensively investigated, but there is sparse information on the association of socioeconomic factors with a person's sleep quality. The aim of the present analysis is to investigate this association, taking particularly the effect of health confounders into consideration. METHODS: The data were extracted from the cross-sectional QUEBEB Study. In total, the study sample consisted of 3281 participants (1817 women and 1464 men, aged 16-72 years). Here socioeconomic status (SES) was collected from the baseline survey taken in 2004. Sleep quality for the same participants was measured with in-depth personal interviews in 2006 using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, together with other relevant characteristics (e.g. anxiety, depression and health status). Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: People living in an urban environment with a high or medium SES have a greater probability of good sleep quality (odds ratio 1.65, 95% confidence interval 1.27-2.14; odds ratio 1.40, 95% confidence interval 1.16-1.69) than persons with a low SES. Anxiety and depression, but also health status, are also associated with sleep quality and can influence in part the socioeconomic levels seen in sleep quality. CONCLUSION: SES and sleep quality are associated. However, there are important additional determinants that influence the level of association between SES and sleep quality. Several factors, such as anxiety, depression and health status, are associated with poorer sleep quality, but at the same time, these factors occur more often within lower social classes.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>24 (6), 968-973</Feld596><PubVol>24</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>968</StrtPage><EndPage>973</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Anders MP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Breckenkamp J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Blettner M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schlehofer B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Berg-Beckhoff G" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24280873</PMID><DOI>10.1093/eurpub/ckt175</DOI><KST>C030</KST><KEYWORD>OLDER-ADULTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>depression</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SYMPTOMS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>duration</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FOLLOW-UP</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INDEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PREVALENCE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEALTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMPLAINTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INSOMNIA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>57545</publishedID><Artikel>Future perspectives in melanoma research: meeting report from the inverted question markMelanoma Bridge inverted question mark, Napoli, December 5th-8th 2013</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Translational Medicine</Journal><ABSTr>The fourth inverted question markMelanoma Bridge Meeting inverted question mark took place in Naples, December 5 to 8th, 2013. The four topics discussed at this meeting were: Diagnosis and New Procedures, Molecular Advances and Combination Therapies, News in Immunotherapy, and Tumor Microenvironment and Biomarkers.Until recently systemic therapy for metastatic melanoma patients was ineffective, but recent research in tumor biology and immunology has led to the development of new targeted and immunotherapeutic agents that prolong progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). New therapies, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway inhibitors, like BRAF and MEK inhibitors, as well as other signaling pathways inhibitors, are being tested in metastatic melanoma either as monotherapy or in combination, and have yielded promising results.Improved survival rates have also been observed with immune therapy for patients with metastatic melanoma. Immune-modulating antibodies came to the forefront with anti-CTLA-4, programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway blocking antibodies that result in durable responses in a subset of melanoma patients. Agents targeting other immune inhibitory (e.g., Tim-3) or immune stimulating (e.g., CD137) receptors and other approaches such as adoptive cell transfer demonstrate clinical benefit in melanoma as well.This meeting inverted question marks specific focus was on advances in targeted therapy and immunotherapy. Both combination targeted therapy approaches and different immunotherapies were discussed. Similarly to the previous meetings, the importance of biomarkers for clinical application as markers for diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of treatment response was an integral part of the meeting. Significant consideration was given to issues surrounding the development of novel therapeutic targets as further study of patterns of resistance to both immunologic and targeted drugs are paramount to future drug development to guide existing and future therapies. The overall emphasis on biomarkers supports novel concepts toward integrating biomarkers into contemporary clinical management of patients with melanoma across the entire spectrum of disease stage. Translation of the knowledge gained from the biology of tumor microenvironment across different tumors represents a bridge to impact on prognosis and response to therapy in melanoma.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>12 (1), Art.

The generation of rAAV Reference Standard Materials (RSM) is key to providing points of reference for particle titer, vector genome titer, and infectious titer for gene transfer vectors. Following the example of the rAAV2RSM, here we have generated and characterized a novel RSM based on rAAV serotype 8. The rAAV8RSM was produced using transient transfection, and the purification was based on density gradient ultracentrifugation. The rAAV8RSM was distributed for characterization along with standard assay protocols to 16 laboratories worldwide. Mean titers and 95% confidence intervals were determined for capsid particles (mean, 5.50x10(11) pt/ml; CI, 4.26x10(11) to 6.75x10(11) pt/ml), vector genomes (mean, 5.75x10(11) vg/ml; CI, 3.05x10(11) to 1.09x10(12) vg/ml), and infectious units (mean, 1.26x10(9) IU/ml; CI, 6.46x10(8) to 2.51x10(9) IU/ml). Notably, there was a significant degree of variation between institutions for each assay despite the relatively tight correlation of assay results within an institution. This outcome emphasizes the need to use RSMs to calibrate the titers of rAAV vectors in preclinical and clinical studies at a time when the field is maturing rapidly. The rAAV8RSM has been deposited at the American Type Culture Collection (VR-1816) and is available to the scientific community.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>25 (11), 977-987</Feld596><PubVol>25</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>977</StrtPage><EndPage>987</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ayuso E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Blouin V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Lock M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="McGorray S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Leon X" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Alvira MR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Auricchio A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Bucher S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Chtarto A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Clark KR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Darmon C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Doria M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Fountain W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Gao G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Gao K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Giacca M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Kleinschmidt J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="17" name="Leuchs B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="18" name="Melas C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Mizukami H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Mueller M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="21" name="Noordman Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Bockstael O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Ozawa K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Pythoud C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Sumaroka M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Surosky R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Tenenbaum L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="van der Linden I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Weins B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Wright JF" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Zhang X" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Zentilin L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Bosch F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Snyder RO" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Moullier P" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25275822</PMID><DOI>10.1089/hum.2014.057</DOI><KST>F010</KST><KEYWORD>CAPSIDS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEMOPHILIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VIRAL VECTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PARTICLES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EFFICIENCY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSDUCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-TRANSFER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LEBERS CONGENITAL AMAUROSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VECTOR REFERENCE-STANDARDS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>57547</publishedID><Artikel>Pancreatic cell plasticity and cancer initiation induced by oncogenic Kras is completely dependent on wild-type PI 3-kinase p110alpha</Artikel><Journal>Genes and Development</Journal><ABSTr>Increased PI 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) correlates with poor prognosis, but the role of class I PI3K isoforms during its induction remains unclear. Using genetically engineered mice and pharmacological isoform-selective inhibitors, we found that the p110alpha PI3K isoform is a major signaling enzyme for PDAC development induced by a combination of genetic and nongenetic factors. Inactivation of this single isoform blocked the irreversible transition of exocrine acinar cells into pancreatic preneoplastic ductal lesions by oncogenic Kras and/or pancreatic injury. Hitting the other ubiquitous isoform, p110beta, did not prevent preneoplastic lesion initiation. p110alpha signaling through small GTPase Rho and actin cytoskeleton controls the reprogramming of acinar cells and regulates cell morphology in vivo and in vitro. Finally, p110alpha was necessary for pancreatic ductal cancers to arise from Kras-induced preneoplastic lesions by increasing epithelial cell proliferation in the context of mutated p53. Here we identify an in vivo context in which p110alpha cellular output differs depending on the epithelial transformation stage and demonstrate that the PI3K p110alpha is required for PDAC induced by oncogenic Kras, the key driver mutation of PDAC. These data are critical for a better understanding of the development of this lethal disease that is currently without efficient treatment.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>28 (23), 2621-2635</Feld596><PubVol>28</PubVol><PubIss>23</PubIss><StrtPage>2621</StrtPage><EndPage>2635</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Baer R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Cintas C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Dufresne M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Cassant-Sourdy S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schoenhuber N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Planque L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Lulka H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Couderc B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Bousquet C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Garmy-Susini B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Vanhaesebroeck B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Pyronnet S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Saur D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Guillermet-Guibert J" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25452273</PMID><DOI>10.1101/gad.249409.114</DOI><KST>L701</KST><KEYWORD>ACTIVATED AKT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ISOFORM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EGF RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>intraepithelial neoplasia</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Ras</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PTEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TUMORIGENESIS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>57550</publishedID><Artikel>Disruption of the PRKCD-FBXO25-HAX-1 axis attenuates the apoptotic response and drives lymphomagenesis</Artikel><Journal>Nature Medicine</Journal><ABSTr>We searched for genetic alterations in human B cell lymphoma that affect the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This approach identified FBXO25 within a minimal common region of frequent deletion in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). FBXO25 encodes an orphan F-box protein that determines the substrate specificity of the SCF (SKP1-CUL1-F-box)(FBXO25) ubiquitin ligase complex. An unbiased screen uncovered the prosurvival protein HCLS1-associated protein X-1 (HAX-1) as the bona fide substrate of FBXO25 that is targeted after apoptotic stresses. Protein kinase Cdelta (PRKCD) initiates this process by phosphorylating FBXO25 and HAX-1, thereby spatially directing nuclear FBXO25 to mitochondrial HAX-1. Our analyses in primary human MCL identify monoallelic loss of FBXO25 and stabilizing HAX1 phosphodegron mutations. Accordingly, FBXO25 re-expression in FBXO25-deleted MCL cells promotes cell death, whereas expression of the HAX-1 phosphodegron mutant inhibits apoptosis. In addition, knockdown of FBXO25 significantly accelerated lymphoma development in Emu-Myc mice and in a human MCL xenotransplant model. Together we identify a PRKCD-dependent proapoptotic mechanism controlling HAX-1 stability, and we propose that FBXO25 functions as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor and that HAX1 is a proto-oncogene in MCL.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>20 (12), 1401-1409</Feld596><PubVol>20</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>1401</StrtPage><EndPage>1409</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Baumann U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Fernandez-Saiz V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Rudelius M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Lemeer S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Rad R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Knorn AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Slawska J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Engel K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Jeremias I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Li Z" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Tomiatti V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Illert AL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Targosz BS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Braun M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Perner S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Leitges M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Klapper W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Dreyling M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Miething C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Lenz G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Rosenwald A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Peschel C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="22" name="Keller U" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="23" name="Kuster B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="24" name="Bassermann F" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25419709</PMID><DOI>10.1038/nm.3740</DOI><KST>L701</KST><KEYWORD>Delta</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA-DAMAGE-RESPONSE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MYC</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MANTLE-CELL LYMPHOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEIN-KINASE-C</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>B-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMPARATIVE GENOMIC HYBRIDIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HOMOZYGOUS DELETIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HAX-1</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>57551</publishedID><Artikel>Variation in NF-kappaB signaling pathways and survival in invasive epithelial ovarian cancer</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers and Prevention</Journal><ABSTr>Survival in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is influenced by the host immune response, yet the key genetic determinants of inflammation and immunity that affect prognosis are not known. The nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcription factor family plays an important role in many immune and inflammatory responses, including the response to cancer. We studied common inherited variation in 210 genes in the NF-kappaB family in 10,084 patients with invasive EOC (5,248 high-grade serous, 1,452 endometrioid, 795 clear cell, and 661 mucinous) from the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium. Associations between genotype and overall survival were assessed using Cox regression for all patients and by major histology, adjusting for known prognostic factors and correcting for multiple testing (threshold for statistical significance, P &lt; 2.5 x 10(-5)). Results were statistically significant when assessed for patients of a single histology. Key associations were with caspase recruitment domain family, member 11 (CARD11) rs41324349 in patients with mucinous EOC [HR, 1.82; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.41-2.35; P = 4.13 x 10(-6)] and tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 13B (TNFRSF13B) rs7501462 in patients with endometrioid EOC (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.56-0.82; P = 2.33 x 10(-5)). Other associations of note included TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) rs17250239 in patients with high-grade serous EOC (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.77-0.92; P = 6.49 x 10(-5)) and phospholipase C, gamma 1 (PLCG1) rs11696662 in patients with clear cell EOC (HR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.26-0.73; P = 4.56 x 10(-4)). These associations highlight the potential importance of genes associated with host inflammation and immunity in modulating clinical outcomes in distinct EOC

model of active bax at the membrane</Artikel><Journal>Molecular Cell</Journal><ABSTr>Bax plays a central role in the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Upon activation, cytosolic Bax monomers oligomerize on the surface of mitochondria and change conformation concertedly to punch holes into the outer membrane. The subsequent release of cytochrome c initiates cell death. However, the structure of membrane-inserted Bax and its mechanism of action remain largely unknown. Here, we propose a 3D model of active Bax at the membrane based on double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy in liposomes and isolated mitochondria. We show that active Bax is organized at the membrane as assemblies of dimers. In addition to a stable dimerization domain, each monomer contains a more flexible piercing domain involved in interdimer interactions and pore formation. The most important structural change during Bax activation is the opening of the hairpin formed by helices 5 and 6, which adopts a clamp-like conformation central to the mechanism of mitochondrial permeabilization.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>56 (4), 496-505</Feld596><PubVol>56</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>496</StrtPage><EndPage>505</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Bleicken S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Jeschke G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Stegmueller C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Salvador-Gallego R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Garcia-Saez AJ" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Bordignon E" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25458844</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.molcel.2014.09.022</DOI><KST>B160</KST><KEYWORD>OLIGOMERIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROAPOPTOTIC BAX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PERMEABILIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BCL-2 FAMILY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL-DEATH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MITOCHONDRIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>APOPTOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BH3</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>57555</publishedID><Artikel>GP130 activation induces myeloma and collaborates with MYC</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Clinical Investigation</Journal><ABSTr>Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell neoplasm that results from clonal expansion of an Ig-secreting terminally differentiated B cell. Advanced MM is characterized by tissue damage that involves bone, kidney, and other organs and is typically associated with recurrent genetic abnormalities. IL-6 signaling via the IL-6 signal transducer GP130 has been implicated as an important driver of MM pathogenesis. Here, we demonstrated that ectopic expression of constitutively active GP130 (L-GP130) in a murine retroviral transduction-transplantation model induces rapid MM development of high penetrance. L-GP130-expressing mice recapitulated all of the characteristics of human disease, including monoclonal gammopathy, BM infiltration with lytic bone lesions, and protein deposition in the kidney. Moreover, the disease was easily transplantable and allowed different therapeutic options to be evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Using this model, we determined that GP130 signaling collaborated with MYC to induce MM and was responsible and sufficient for directing the plasma cell phenotype. Accordingly, we identified Myc aberrations in the L-GP130 MM model. Evaluation of human MM samples revealed recurrent activation of STAT3, a downstream target of GP130 signaling. Together, our results indicate that deregulated GP130 activity contributes to MM pathogenesis and that pathways downstream of GP130 activity have potential as therapeutic targets in MM.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>124 (12), 5263-5274</Feld596><PubVol>124</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>5263</StrtPage><EndPage>5274</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Dechow T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Steidle S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Goetze KS" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Rudelius M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Behnke K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Pechloff K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Kratzat S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Bullinger L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Fend F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Soberon V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Mitova N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Li Z" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Thaler M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Bauer J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Pietschmann E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Albers C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Grundler R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Schmidt-Supprian M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Ruland J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Peschel C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="20" name="Duyster J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Rose-John S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Bassermann F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="23" name="Keller U" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25384216</PMID><DOI>10.1172/JCI69094</DOI><KST>L601</KST><KST>L701</KST><KST>L801</KST><KEYWORD>SOLUBLE INTERLEUKIN-6 RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH-FACTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BONE-MARROW</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MARROW STROMAL CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STAT3 ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MULTIPLE-MYELOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BCL-X-L</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MOLECULAR CLASSIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION PROFILES</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>57556</publishedID><Artikel>Prediagnostic intake of dairy products and dietary calcium and colorectal cancer survival--results from the EPIC cohort study</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers and Prevention</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: We investigated whether prediagnostic reported intake of dairy products and dietary calcium is associated with colorectal cancer survival. METHODS: Data from 3,859 subjects with colorectal cancer (42.1% male; mean age at diagnosis, 64.2 +/- 8.1 years) in the European Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort were analyzed. Intake of dairy products and dietary calcium was assessed at baseline (1992-2000) using validated, country-specific dietary questionnaires. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to calculate HR and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for colorectal cancer-specific death (n = 1,028) and all-cause death (n = 1,525) for different quartiles of intake. RESULTS: The consumption of total dairy products was not statistically significantly associated with risk of colorectal cancer-specific death (adjusted HR Q4 vs. Q1, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.97-1.43) nor that of all-cause death (Q4 vs. Q1, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.98-1.36). Multivariable-adjusted HRs for colorectal cancer-specific death (Q4 vs. Q1) were 1.21 (95% CI, 0.99-1.48) for milk, 1.09 (95% CI, 0.88-1.34) for yoghurt, and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.76-1.14) for cheese. The intake of dietary calcium was not associated with the risk of colorectal cancer-specific death (adjusted HR Q4 vs. Q1, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.81-1.26) nor that of all-cause death (Q4 vs. Q1, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.84-1.21). CONCLUSIONS: The prediagnostic reported intake of dairy products and dietary calcium is not associated with disease-specific or all-cause risk of death in patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer. IMPACT: The impact of diet on cancer survival is largely unknown. This study shows that despite its inverse association with colorectal cancer risk, the prediagnostic intake of dairy and dietary calcium does not affect colorectal cancer survival.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (9), 1813-1823</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>1813</StrtPage><EndPage>1823</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Dik VK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Murphy N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Siersema PD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Fedirko V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Jenab M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Kong SY" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Hansen CP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Overvad K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Tjonneland A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Olsen A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Dossus L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Racine A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Bastide N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Li K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="14" name="Kuehn T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Boeing H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Aleksandrova K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Trichopoulos D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Barbitsioti A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Palli D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Contiero P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Vineis P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Tumino R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Panico S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Peeters PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Weiderpass E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="27" name="Skeie G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="28" name="Hjartaker A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="29" name="Amiano P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="30" name="Sanchez MJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="31" name="Fonseca-Nunes A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="32" name="Barricarte A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="33" name="Chirlaque MD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="34" name="Redondo ML" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="35" name="Jirstrom K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="36" name="Manjer J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="37" name="Nilsson LM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="38" name="Wennberg M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="39" name="Bradbury KE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="40" name="Khaw KT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="41" name="Wareham N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="42" name="Cross AJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="43" name="Riboli E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="44" name="Bueno-de-Mesquita HB" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24917183</PMID><DOI>10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-14-0172</DOI><KST>C020</KST><KEYWORD>GROWTH-FACTOR-I</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BINDING PROTEIN-3</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>insulin</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CONTROLLED-TRIAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VITAMIN-D</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MILK INTAKE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>III COLON-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MORTALITY</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>57557</publishedID><Artikel>Uncoupling malt1 threshold function from paracaspase activity results in destructive autoimmune inflammation</Artikel><Journal>Cell Reports</Journal><ABSTr>The paracaspase Malt1 is a central regulator of antigen receptor signaling that is frequently mutated in human lymphoma. As a scaffold, it assembles protein complexes for NF-kappaB activation, and its proteolytic domain cleaves negative NF-kappaB regulators for signal enforcement. Still, the physiological functions of Malt1-protease are unknown. We demonstrate that targeted Malt1-paracaspase inactivation induces a lethal inflammatory syndrome with lymphocyte-dependent neurodegeneration in vivo. Paracaspase activity is essential for regulatory T cell (Treg) and innate-like B cell development, but it is largely dispensable for overcoming Malt1-dependent thresholds for lymphocyte activation. In addition to NF-kappaB inhibitors, Malt1 cleaves an entire set of mRNA stability regulators, including Roquin-1, Roquin-2, and Regnase-1, and paracaspase inactivation results in excessive interferon gamma (IFNgamma) production by effector lymphocytes that drive pathology. Together, our results reveal distinct threshold and modulatory functions of Malt1 that differentially control lymphocyte differentiation and activation pathways and demonstrate that selective paracaspase blockage skews systemic immunity toward destructive autoinflammation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (4), 1292-1305</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>1292</StrtPage><EndPage>1305</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Gewies A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Gorka O" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bergmann H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Pechloff K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Petermann F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Jeltsch KM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Rudelius M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Kriegsmann M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Weichert W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Horsch M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Beckers J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Wurst W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Heikenwalder M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Korn T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Heissmeyer V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Ruland J" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25456129</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.celrep.2014.10.044</DOI><KST>L701</KST><KEYWORD>MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NF-KAPPA-B</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MESSENGER-RNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MUTATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CLEAVAGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HELPER T-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COMBINED IMMUNODEFICIENCY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ROQUIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LYMPHOID-TISSUE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>57558</publishedID><Artikel>Intramitochondrial recruitment of endolysosomes mediates Smac degradation and constitutes a novel intrinsic apoptosis antagonizing function of XIAP E3 ligase</Artikel><Journal>Cell Death and Differentiation</Journal><ABSTr>Intrinsic apoptosis involves BH3-only protein activation of Bax/Bak-mediated mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). Consequently, cytochrome c is released from the mitochondria to activate caspases, and Smac (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases) to inhibit XIAP-mediated caspase suppression. Dysfunctional mitochondria can be targeted for lysosomal degradation via autophagy (mitophagy), or directly through mitochondria-derived vesicle transport. However, the extent of autophagy and lysosomal interactions with apoptotic mitochondria remains largely unknown. We describe here a novel pathway of endolysosomal processing of mitochondria, activated in response to canonical BH3-only proteins and mitochondrial depolarization. We report that expression of canonical BH3-only proteins, tBid, BimEL, Bik, Bad, and mitophagy receptor mutants of atypical BH3-only proteins, Bnip3 and Bnip3L/Nix, leads to prominent relocalization of endolysosomes into inner mitochondrial compartments, in a manner independent of mitophagy. As an upstream regulator, we identified the XIAP E3 ligase. In response to mitochondrial depolarization, XIAP actuates Bax-mediated MOMP, even in the absence of BH3-only protein signaling. Subsequently, in an E3 ligase-dependent manner, XIAP rapidly localizes inside all the mitochondria, and XIAP-mediated mitochondrial ubiquitylation catalyses interactions of Rab membrane targeting components Rabex-5 and Rep-1 (RFP-tagged Rab escort protein-1), and Rab5- and Rab7-positive endolysosomes, at and within mitochondrial membrane compartments. While XIAP-mediated MOMP permits delayed cytochrome c release, within the mitochondria XIAP selectively signals lysosome- and proteasome-associated degradation of its inhibitor Smac. These findings suggest a general mechanism to lower the mitochondrial apoptotic potential via intramitochondrial degradation of Smac.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>21 (12), 1862-1876</Feld596><PubVol>21</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>1862</StrtPage><EndPage>1876</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hamacher-Brady A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Choe SC" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Krijnse-Locker J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Brady NR" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25080938</PMID><DOI>10.1038/cdd.2014.101</DOI><KST>B170</KST><KST>B190</KST><KEYWORD>MITOCHONDRIAL-MEMBRANE PERMEABILIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MITOPHAGY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PARKIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL-DEATH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BINDING</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>caspase-3</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>UBIQUITIN-LIGASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AUTOPHAGY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Bnip3</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>57559</publishedID><Artikel>Loss of PHD3 allows tumours to overcome hypoxic growth inhibition and sustain proliferation through EGFR</Artikel><Journal>Nature Communications</Journal><ABSTr>Solid tumours are exposed to microenvironmental factors such as hypoxia that normally inhibit cell growth. However, tumour cells are capable of counteracting these signals through mechanisms that are largely unknown. Here we show that the prolyl hydroxylase PHD3 restrains tumour growth in response to microenvironmental cues through the control of EGFR. PHD3 silencing in human gliomas or genetic deletion in a murine high-grade astrocytoma model markedly promotes tumour growth and the ability of tumours to continue growing under unfavourable conditions. The growth-suppressive function of PHD3 is independent of the established PHD3 targets HIF and NF-kappaB and its hydroxylase activity. Instead, loss of PHD3 results in hyperphosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Importantly, epigenetic/genetic silencing of PHD3 preferentially occurs in gliomas without EGFR amplification. Our findings reveal that PHD3 inactivation provides an alternative route of EGFR activation through which tumour cells sustain proliferative signalling even under conditions of limited oxygen availability.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>5 (), Art.Nr.: 5582-</Feld596><PubVol>5</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>Art.Nr.: 5582</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Henze AT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Garvalov BK" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Seidel S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Cuesta AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Ritter M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Filatova A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Foss F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Dopeso H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Essmann CL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Maxwell PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Reifenberger G" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Carmeliet P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Acker-Palmer A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Acker T" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25420773</PMID><DOI>10.1038/ncomms6582</DOI><KST>L401</KST><KEYWORD>INDUCIBLE FACTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HIF</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>APOPTOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANGIOGENESIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FACTOR RECEPTOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COLORECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OXYGEN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROLYL HYDROXYLASES PHD1</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>57561</publishedID><Artikel>The impact of type 2 diabetes on the outcome of localized renal cell carcinoma</Artikel><Journal>World Journal of Urology</Journal><ABSTr>PURPOSE: To evaluate the influence of type 2 diabetes on cancer-specific outcome in patients undergoing surgery for localized renal cell carcinoma (RCC). METHODS: A total of 1,140 patients with localized RCC undergoing radical or partial nephrectomy were enrolled into this retrospective case-control study. Primary outcome was the cancer-specific survival comparing patients with and without type 2 diabetes at the time of surgery. Secondary outcomes were recurrence-free survival and metastases-free survival comparing the same groups. Additionally, the influence of accompanying factors on cancer-specific survival and overall survival of patients was evaluated in a multivariate analysis. Among 1,140 patients included in the analyses, 202 had diabetes at the time of surgery and 938 patients without diabetes served as control. RESULTS: The univariate comparisons between patients with and without diabetes regarding recurrence-free, metastases-free, and cancer-specific survival revealed no significant differences. Multivariate results demonstrate that age, BMI, and diabetes had no significant effect on cancer-specific hazard among participants. After adjustment of the factors in terms of overall survival, however, increased age, increased BMI, and type 2 diabetes at the time of surgery were independent risk factors for the occurrence of the event death. CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 diabetes and obesity at the time of surgery have no significant impact on cancer-specific and recurrence-free survival in patients with localized renal cancer.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>32 (6), 1537-1542</Feld596><PubVol>32</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>1537</StrtPage><EndPage>1542</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hoefner T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Zeier M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Hatiboglu G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Eisen C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schonberg G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hadaschik B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Teber D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Duensing S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Trumpp A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Hohenfellner M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Pahernik S" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24370691</PMID><DOI>10.1007/s00345-013-1231-z</DOI><KST>A010</KST><KST>V960</KST><KEYWORD>PROSTATE-CANCER RISK</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HYPERTENSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLUCOSE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>OBESITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ASSOCIATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METAANALYSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MELLITUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>Nephrectomy</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>57562</publishedID><Artikel>GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors promote glutamate synapse development in hippocampal interneurons</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Neuroscience</Journal><ABSTr>In postnatal development, GluN2B-containing NMDARs are critical for the functional maturation of glutamatergic synapses. GluN2B-containing NMDARs prevail until the second postnatal week when GluN2A subunits are progressively added, conferring mature properties to NMDARs. In cortical principal neurons, deletion of GluN2B results in an increase in functional AMPAR synapses, suggesting that GluN2B-containing NMDARs set a brake on glutamate synapse maturation. The function of GluN2B in the maturation of glutamatergic inputs to cortical interneurons is not known. To examine the function of GluN2B in interneurons, we generated mutant mice with conditional deletion of GluN2B in interneurons (GluN2B(DeltaGAD67)). In GluN2B(DeltaGAD67) mice interneurons distributed normally in cortical brain regions. After the second postnatal week, GluN2B(DeltaGAD67) mice developed hippocampal seizures and died shortly thereafter. Before the onset of seizures, GluN2B-deficient hippocampal interneurons received fewer glutamatergic synaptic inputs than littermate controls, indicating that GluN2B-containing NMDARs positively regulate the maturation of glutamatergic input synapses in interneurons. These findings suggest that GluN2B-containing NMDARs keep the circuit activity under control by promoting the maturation of excitatory synapses in interneurons.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>34 (48), 16022-16030</Feld596><PubVol>34</PubVol><PubIss>48</PubIss><StrtPage>16022</StrtPage><EndPage>16030</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kelsch W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Li Z" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Wieland S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Senkov O" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Herb A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Gongrich C" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Monyer H" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25429143</PMID><DOI>10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1210-14.2014</DOI><KST>A230</KST><KEYWORD>CORTEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>autism</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SYSTEM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>brain</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISRUPTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEURONAL PATTERNS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>AMPA</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>57563</publishedID><Artikel>New insights in the composition of extracellular vesicles from pancreatic cancer cells: implications for biomarkers and functions</Artikel><Journal>Proteome Science</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer development is associated with characteristic alterations like desmoplastic reaction and immune escape which are mediated by the cell-cell communication mechanism and by the microenvironment of the cells. The whole of released components are important determinants in these processes. Especially the extracellular vesicles released by pancreatic cancer cells play a role in cell communication and modulate cell growth and immune responses. RESULTS: Here, we present the proteomic description of affinity purified extracellular vesicles from pancreatic tumour cells, compared to the secretome, defined as the whole of the proteins released by pancreatic cancer cells. The proteomic data provide comprehensive catalogues of hundreds of proteins, and the comparison reveals a special proteomic composition of pancreatic cancer cell derived extracellular vesicles. The functional analysis of the protein composition displayed that membrane proteins, glycoproteins, small GTP binding proteins and a further, heterogeneous group of proteins are enriched in vesicles, whereas proteins derived from proteasomes and ribosomes, as well as metabolic enzymes, are not components of the vesicles. Furthermore proteins playing a role in carcinogenesis and modulators of the extracellular matrix (ECM) or cell-cell interactions are components of affinity purified extracellular vesicles. CONCLUSION: The data deepen the knowledge of extracellular vesicle composition by hundreds of proteins that have not been previously described as vesicle components released by pancreatic cancer cells. Extracellular vesicles derived from pancreatic cancer cells show common proteins shared with other vesicles as well as cell type specific proteins indicating biomarker candidates and suggesting functional roles in cancer cell stroma interactions.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>12 (1), Art.

The important roles of p21 in the interphase of the cell cycle have been intensively investigated. The function of p21 in mitosis has been proposed but not systematically studied. We show here that p21 is abundant in mitosis and binds to and inhibits the activity of Cdk1/cyclin B1. Deficiency of p21 prolongs the duration of mitosis by extending metaphase, anaphase and cytokinesis. The activity of Aurora B is reduced and the localization of Aurora B on the central spindle is disturbed in anaphase cells without p21. Moreover, HCT116 p21-/-, HeLa and Saos-2 cells depleted of p21 encounter problems in chromosome segregation and cytokinesis. Gently inhibiting the mitotic Cdk1 or add-back of p21 rescues segregation defect in HCT116 p21-/- cells. Our data demonstrate that p21 is important for a fine-tuned control of the Cdk1 activity in mitosis, and its proper function facilitates a smooth mitotic progression. Given that p21 is downregulated in the majority of tumors, either by the loss of tumor suppressors like p53 or by hyperactive oncogenes such as c-myc, this finding also sheds new light on the molecular mechanisms by which p21 functions as a tumor suppressor.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>33 (50), 5716-5728</Feld596><PubVol>33</PubVol><PubIss>50</PubIss><StrtPage>5716</StrtPage><EndPage>5728</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kreis NN" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Sanhaji M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Rieger MA" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Louwen F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Yuan J" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24317508</PMID><DOI>10.1038/onc.2013.518</DOI><KST>L501</KST><KEYWORD>SUPPRESSOR P53</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SMALL-MOLECULE INHIBITOR</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN FIBROBLASTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>KINASE-ACTIVITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA-DAMAGE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>p21</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHROMOSOMAL PASSENGER COMPLEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CYCLIN B1</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>57567</publishedID><Artikel>Enrichment of c-Met+ tumorigenic stromal cells of giant cell tumor of bone and targeting by cabozantinib</Artikel><Journal>Cell Death and Disease</Journal><ABSTr>Giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB) is a very rare tumor entity, which is little examined owing to the lack of established cell lines and mouse models and the restriction of available primary cell lines. The stromal cells of GCTB have been made responsible for the aggressive growth and metastasis, emphasizing the presence of a cancer stem cell population. To identify and target such tumor-initiating cells, stromal cells were isolated from eight freshly resected GCTB tissues. Tumorigenic properties were examined by colony and spheroid formation, differentiation, migration, MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay, immunohistochemistry, antibody protein array, Alu in situ hybridization, FACS analysis and xenotransplantation into fertilized chicken eggs and mice. A sub-population of the neoplastic stromal cells formed spheroids and colonies, differentiated to osteoblasts, migrated to wounded regions and expressed the metastasis marker CXC-chemokine receptor type 4, indicating self-renewal, invasion and differentiation potential. Compared with adherent-growing cells, markers for pluripotency, stemness and cancer progression, including the CSC surface marker c-Met, were enhanced in spheroidal cells. This c-Met-enriched sub-population formed xenograft tumors in fertilized chicken eggs and mice. Cabozantinib, an inhibitor of c-Met in phase II trials, eliminated CSC features with a higher therapeutic effect than standard chemotherapy. This study identifies a c-Met(+) tumorigenic sub-population within stromal GCTB cells and suggests the c-Met inhibitor cabozantinib as a new therapeutic option for targeted elimination of unresectable or recurrent GCTB.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>5 (), e1471-</Feld596><PubVol>5</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>e1471</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Liu L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Aleksandrowicz E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Fan P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Schoensiegel F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Zhang Y" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Sahr H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Gladkich J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Mattern J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Depeweg D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Lehner B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Fellenberg J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Herr I" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25321478</PMID><DOI>10.1038/cddis.2014.440</DOI><KST>G403</KST><KEYWORD>DENOSUMAB</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IDENTIFICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POPULATIONS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MARKER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN PANCREATIC-CANCER</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FEATURES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>C-MET</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CANCER STEM-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INITIATING CELLS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>57568</publishedID><Artikel>A memory system of negative polarity cues prevents replicative aging</Artikel><Journal>Cell</Journal><ABSTr>Cdc42 is a highly conserved master regulator of cell polarity. Here, we investigated the mechanism by which yeast cells never re-establish polarity at cortical sites (cytokinesis remnants [CRMs]) that have previously supported Cdc42-mediated growth as a paradigm to mechanistically understand how Cdc42-inhibitory polarity cues are established. We revealed a two-step mechanism of loading the Cdc42 antagonist Nba1 into CRMs to mark these compartments as refractory for a second round of Cdc42 activation. Our data indicate that Nba1 together with a cortically tethered adaptor protein confers memory of previous polarization events to translate this spatial legacy into a biochemical signal that ensures the local singularity of Cdc42 activation. "Memory loss" mutants that repeatedly use the same polarity site over multiple generations display nuclear segregation defects and a shorter lifespan. Our work thus established CRMs as negative polarity cues that prevent Cdc42 reactivation to sustain the fitness of replicating cells.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>159 (5), 1056-1069</Feld596><PubVol>159</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>1056</StrtPage><EndPage>1069</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Meitinger F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Khmelinskii A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Morlot S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kurtulmus B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Palani S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Andres-Pons A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Hub B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Knop M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Charvin G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Pereira G" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25416945</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.cell.2014.10.014</DOI><KST>A180</KST><KST>F200</KST><KEYWORD>BUD-SITE SELECTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SYMMETRY-BREAKING</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RHO FAMILY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SMALL GTPASES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL POLARITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CAENORHABDITIS-ELEGANS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BUDDING YEAST</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>57569</publishedID><Artikel>Association of seropositivity to Helicobacter species and biliary tract cancer in the ATBC study</Artikel><Journal>Hepatology</Journal><ABSTr>Helicobacter have been detected in human bile and hepatobiliary tissue. Despite evidence that Helicobacter species promote gallstone formation and hepatobiliary tumors in laboratory studies, it remains unclear whether Helicobacter species contribute to these cancers in humans. We used a multiplex panel to assess whether seropositivity to 15 Helicobacter pylori proteins was associated with subsequent incidence of hepatobiliary cancers in the Finnish Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study. We included 64 biliary cancers, 122 liver cancers, and 224 age-matched controls which occurred over the course of 22 years. Helicobacter pylori seropositivity was defined as those positive to &gt;/= 4 antigens. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals were adjusted for major hepatobiliary cancer risk factors. Among the controls, 88% were seropositive to H. pylori at baseline. Among those who subsequently developed hepatobiliary cancer, the prevalence of seropositivity was higher: 100% for gallbladder cancer, 97% of extrahepatic bile duct cancer, 91% of ampula of Vater cancer, 96% of intrahepatic bile duct cancer, and 94% of hepatocellular carcinoma. Although the OR for gallbladder cancer could not be calculated, the OR for the other sites were 7.01 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.79-62.33), 2.21 (0.19-25.52), 10.67 (0.76-150.08), and 1.20 (0.42-3.45), respectively, with an OR of 5.47 (95% CI: 1.17-25.65) observed for the biliary tract cancers combined. ORs above 1 were observed for many of the investigated antigens, although most of these associations were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Seropositivity to H. pylori proteins was associated with an increased risk of biliary tract cancers in ATBC. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings and to determine how H. pylori might influence the risk of biliary tract cancer.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>60 (6), 1963-1971</Feld596><PubVol>60</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>1963</StrtPage><EndPage>1971</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Murphy G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Michel A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Taylor PR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Albanes D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Weinstein SJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Virtamo J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Parisi D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Snyder K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Butt J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="McGlynn KA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Koshiol J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Pawlita M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="12" name="Lai GY" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Abnet CC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Dawsey SM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Freedman ND" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24797247</PMID><DOI>10.1002/hep.27193</DOI><KST>F020</KST><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MORTALITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIVER-TRANSPLANTATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMPACT</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALLOCATION SYSTEM</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>WAITING-LIST</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>57575</publishedID><Artikel>Cutaneous Innate Immune Sensing of Toll-like Receptor 2-6 Ligands Suppresses T Cell Immunity by Inducing Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells</Artikel><Journal>Immunity</Journal><ABSTr>Skin is constantly exposed to bacteria and antigens, and cutaneous innate immune sensing orchestrates adaptive immune responses. In its absence, skin pathogens can expand, entering deeper tissues and leading to life-threatening infectious diseases. To characterize skin-driven immunity better, we applied living bacteria, defined lipopeptides, and antigens cutaneously. We found suppression of immune responses due to cutaneous infection with Gram-positive S. aureus, which was based on bacterial lipopeptides. Skin exposure to Toll-like receptor (TLR)2-6-binding lipopeptides, but not TLR2-1-binding lipopeptides, potently suppressed immune responses through induction of Gr1(+)CD11b(+) myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Investigating human atopic dermatitis, in which Gram-positive bacteria accumulate, we detected high MDSC amounts in blood and skin. TLR2 activation in skin resident cells triggered interleukin-6 (IL-6), which induced suppressive MDSCs, which are then recruited to the skin suppressing T cell-mediated recall responses such as dermatitis. Thus, cutaneous bacteria can negatively regulate skin-driven immune responses by inducing MDSCs via TLR2-6 activation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>41 (5), 762-775</Feld596><PubVol>41</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>762</StrtPage><EndPage>775</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Skabytska Y" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Wolbing F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Gunther C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Koberle M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kaesler S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Chen KM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Guenova E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Demircioglu D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Kempf WE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Volz T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Rammensee HG" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Schaller M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Rocken M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Gotz F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Biedermann T" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25456159</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.immuni.2014.10.009</DOI><KST>L801</KST><KEYWORD>SKIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ACCUMULATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VIVO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIPOPROTEINS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>inflammation</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ATOPIC-DERMATITIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BACTERIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CYTOKINE PRODUCTION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIPOPEPTIDE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>57577</publishedID><Artikel>Occupational exposure to extremely low-frequency magnetic fields and brain tumor risks in the INTEROCC study</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers and Prevention</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Occupational exposure to extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (ELF) is a suspected risk factor for brain tumors, however the literature is inconsistent. Few studies have assessed whether ELF in different time windows of exposure may be associated with specific histologic types of brain tumors. This study examines the association between ELF and brain tumors in the large-scale INTEROCC study. METHODS: Cases of adult primary glioma and meningioma were recruited in seven countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Israel, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom) between 2000 and 2004. Estimates of mean workday ELF exposure based on a job exposure matrix were assigned. Estimates of cumulative exposure, average exposure, maximum exposure, and exposure duration were calculated for the lifetime, and 1 to 4, 5 to 9, and 10+ years before the diagnosis/reference date. RESULTS: There were 3,761 included brain tumor cases (1,939 glioma and 1,822 meningioma) and 5,404 population controls. There was no association between lifetime cumulative ELF exposure and glioma or meningioma risk. However, there were positive associations between cumulative ELF 1 to 4 years before the diagnosis/reference date and glioma [odds ratio (OR) &gt;/= 90th percentile vs. &lt; 25th percentile, 1.67; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.36-2.07; PLinear trend &lt; 0.0001], and, somewhat weaker associations with meningioma (OR &gt;/= 90th percentile vs. &lt; 25th percentile, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.97-1.57; PLinear trend = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Results showed positive associations between ELF in the recent past and glioma. IMPACT: Occupational ELF exposure may play a role in the later stages (promotion and progression) of brain tumorigenesis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>23 (9), 1863-1872</Feld596><PubVol>23</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>1863</StrtPage><EndPage>1872</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Turner MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Benke G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bowman JD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Figuerola J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Fleming S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hours M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Kincl L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Krewski D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="McLean D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Parent ME" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Richardson L" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Sadetzki S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Schlaefer K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="13" name="Schlehofer B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="14" name="Schuez J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Siemiatycki J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="van Tongeren M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Cardis E" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24935666</PMID><DOI>10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-14-0102</DOI><KST>C030</KST></row><row><publishedID>57578</publishedID><Artikel>Proteome-wide analysis reveals an age-associated cellular phenotype of in situ aged human fibroblasts</Artikel><Journal>Aging</Journal><ABSTr>We analyzed an ex vivo model of in situ aged human dermal fibroblasts, obtained from 15 adult healthy donors from three different age groups using an unbiased quantitative proteome-wide approach applying label-free mass spectrometry. Thereby, we identified 2409 proteins, including 43 proteins with an age-associated abundance change. Most of the differentially abundant proteins have not been described in the context of fibroblasts' aging before, but the deduced biological processes confirmed known hallmarks of aging and led to a consistent picture of eight biological categories involved in fibroblast aging, namely proteostasis, cell cycle and proliferation, development and differentiation, cell death, cell organization and cytoskeleton, response to stress, cell communication and signal transduction, as well as RNA metabolism and translation. The exhaustive analysis of protein and mRNA data revealed that 77 % of the age-associated proteins were not linked to expression changes of the corresponding transcripts. This is in line with an associated miRNA study and led us to the conclusion that most of the age-associated alterations detected at the proteome level are likely caused post-transcriptionally rather than by differential gene expression. In summary, our findings led to the characterization of novel proteins potentially associated with fibroblast aging and revealed that primary cultures of in situ aged fibroblasts are characterized by moderate age-related proteomic changes comprising the multifactorial process of aging.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>6 (10), 856-878</Feld596><PubVol>6</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>856</StrtPage><EndPage>878</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Waldera-Lupa DM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Kalfalah F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Florea AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Sass S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kruse F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Rieder V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Tigges J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Fritsche E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Krutmann J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Busch H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Boerries M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Meyer HE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Boege F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Theis F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Reifenberger G" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="15" name="Stuhler K" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25411231</PMID><KST>L401</KST><KEYWORD>ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM STRESS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CYCLE ARREST</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EXPRESSION PROFILES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>senescence</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>dermal fibroblasts</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DISEASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GROWTH</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RNA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NF-KAPPA-B</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTERACTION NETWORKS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>57626</publishedID><Artikel>Hepatitis C Virus RNA Replication and Assembly: Living on the Fat of the Land</Artikel><Journal>Cell Host and Microbe</Journal><ABSTr>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major global health burden accounting for around 170 million chronic infections worldwide. Although highly potent direct-acting antiviral drugs to treat chronic hepatitis C have been approved recently, owing to their high costs and limited availability and a large number of undiagnosed infections, the burden of disease is expected to rise in the next few years. In addition, HCV is an excellent paradigm for understanding the tight link between a pathogen and host cell pathways, most notably lipid metabolism. HCV extensively remodels intracellular membranes to establish its cytoplasmic replication factory and also usurps components of the intercellular lipid transport system for production of infectious virus particles. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms of viral replicase function, cellular pathways employed during HCV replication factory biogenesis, and viral, as well as cellular, determinants of progeny virus production.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>16 (5), 569-579</Feld596><PubVol>16</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>569</StrtPage><EndPage>579</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Paul D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Madan V" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Bartenschlager R" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25525790</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.chom.2014.10.008</DOI><KST>F170</KST><KEYWORD>NONSTRUCTURAL PROTEIN 4B</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MEMBRANOUS WEB FORMATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NS5A PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DIACYLGLYCEROL ACYLTRANSFERASE-1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>POLYMERASE ACTIVITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>APOLIPOPROTEIN-E</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VIRAL REPLICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LOW-DENSITY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CELL-CULTURE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>57627</publishedID><Artikel>Comparing the use of protons and carbon ions for treatment</Artikel><Journal>Cancer Journal</Journal><ABSTr>Protons and carbon ions currently are the most used charged-particle therapies in the cancer treatment of humans.

BMJ 2014; 348: g3656</Artikel><Journal>Forschende Komplementaermedizin</Journal><ABSTr>OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations (25(OH)D) and mortality in a large consortium of cohort studies paying particular attention to potential age, sex, season, and country differences. DESIGN: Meta-analysis of individual participant data of eight prospective cohort studies from Europe and the US. SETTING: General population. PARTICIPANTS: 26,018 men and women aged 50-79 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality. RESULTS: 25(OH)D concentrations varied strongly by season (higher in summer), country (higher in US and northern Europe) and sex (higher in men), but no consistent trend with age was observed. During follow-up, 6695 study participants died, among whom 2624 died of cardiovascular diseases and 2227 died of cancer. For each cohort and analysis, 25(OH)D quintiles were defined with cohort and subgroup specific cut-off values. Comparing bottom versus top quintiles resulted in a pooled risk ratio of 1.57 (95% CI 1.36 to 1.81) for all-cause mortality. Risk ratios for cardiovascular mortality were similar in magnitude to that for all-cause mortality in subjects both with and without a history of cardiovascular disease at baseline. With respect to cancer mortality, an association was only observed among subjects with a history of cancer (risk ratio, 1.70 (1.00 to 2.88)). Analyses using all quintiles suggest curvilinear, inverse, dose-response curves for the aforementioned relationships. No strong age, sex, season, or country specific differences were detected. Heterogeneity was low in most meta-analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Despite levels of 25(OH)D strongly varying with country, sex, and season, the association between 25(OH)D level and all-cause and cause-specific mortality was remarkably consistent. Results from a long term randomised controlled trial addressing longevity are being awaited before vitamin D supplementation can be recommended in most individuals with low 25(OH)D levels.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>21 (4), 259-260</Feld596><PubVol>21</PubVol><PubIss>4</PubIss><StrtPage>259</StrtPage><EndPage>260</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schoettker B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Jorde R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Peasey A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Thorand B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Jansen EH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Groot Ld" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Streppel M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Gardiner J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Ordonez-Mena JM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Perna L" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="10" name="Wilsgaard T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Rathmann W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Feskens E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Kampman E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Siganos G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Njolstad I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Mathiesen EB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Kubinova R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Pajak A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="19" name="Topor-Madry R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Tamosiunas A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Hughes M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Kee F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Bobak M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="24" name="Trichopoulou A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="25" name="Boffetta P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="26" name="Brenner H" IsDKFZ="1"/><KST>C070</KST><KEYWORD>TRIALS</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>57643</publishedID><Artikel>AALAS/FELASA Working Group on Health Monitoring of Rodents for Animal Transfer</Artikel><Journal>Journal of the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>53 (6), 633-640</Feld596><PubVol>53</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>633</StrtPage><EndPage>640</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Pritchett-Corning,K.R."

Of the numerous terms proffered to describe this phenomenon, it is recommended that the acronym SDE be retained based on its qualities and the fact that its perceived shortcomings are invalid. The term can be readily applied to any process that exhibits the phenomenon of transforming a scalemic sample into fractions containing different enantiomeric compositions in comparison to the enantiomeric composition of the starting sample, and is not restricted solely to chromatographic occurrences. Chromatographic observations, though, can be specifically described by the term enantiomer self-disproportionation over achiral chromatography (ESDAC). Use of the term homochiral in concert with its intended original meaning is also advocated.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>97 (11), 1583-1589</Feld596><PubVol>97</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>1583</StrtPage><EndPage>1589</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Soloshonok,V.A."

In this Article, we report interim data (up to Jan 11, 2013) to support longer-term tolerability and efficacy of everolimus from the continuing 4-year extension phase of EXIST-1. METHODS: We assessed data from a prospective, open-label extension of a multicentre, phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex who had SEGA that was growing and needed treatment. In this extension study, we included all patients who had been assigned everolimus during the double-blind, randomised phase of the trial and those patients who crossed over from the placebo group to receive everolimus during the randomised phase or at the start of the extension phase. All patients received oral everolimus at a starting dose of 4.5 mg/m(2) per day. Everolimus dose was subsequently adjusted subject to tolerability to attain blood trough concentrations of 5-15 ng/mL. An independent central radiology review team assessed SEGA response (at least a 50% reduction from baseline in total volume of all target SEGAs; the primary endpoint) by MRI at 12, 24, and 48 weeks, then every year thereafter in all patients who received at least one dose of everolimus. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00789828. FINDINGS: Of the original 117 randomly assigned patients, 111 were given everolimus between Aug 20, 2009, and Jan 11, 2013 (date of data cutoff); we included these patients in our longer-term analysis. Median duration of everolimus exposure was 29.3 months (IQR 19.4-33.8). Median follow-up was 28.3 months (IQR 19.3-33.0). 54 (49%) patients had a response of 50% or greater reduction in SEGA volume (95% CI 39.0-58.3), and duration of response was between 2.1 and 31.1 months (median not reached). SEGA volume was reduced by 50% or more in 39 (37%) of 105 patients at 24 weeks, 48 (46%) of 104 patients at 48 weeks, 36 (47%) of 76 patients at 96 weeks, and 11 (38%) of 29 patients at 144 weeks. Stomatitis (48 [43%] patients) and mouth ulceration (33 [30%] patients) were the most frequent treatment-related adverse events; infections were the most commonly reported treatment-related serious adverse event, occurring in 15 (14%) patients. 35 (32%) patients reported treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events, the most common of which were stomatitis (nine [8%]) and pneumonia (nine [8%]). 18 (16%) patients had treatment-related serious adverse events. Six (5%) patients withdrew because of adverse events. INTERPRETATION: These results support the longer-term use of everolimus in patients who have few treatment options and who need continued treatment for tuberous sclerosis complex and its varied manifestations. Reduction or stabilisation of tumour volume with everolimus will hopefully provide long-term clinical benefit in patients with SEGA.

Nineteen patients (male, n=15; median age at diagnosis 21 months) were identified. Nine patients presented with metastatic disease at diagnosis. A partial or subtotal resection was achieved in 11, a total resection in five and a biopsy in three patients. Patients received a median of six chemotherapy cycles prior to HDCT. Additional radiotherapy was performed in 14 patients (first-line, n=9; following progression, n=5). Six patients underwent tandem auto-SCT. Disease status before HDCT was CR in six, PR in eight, stable disease in two and progressive disease (PD) in two patients (data missing, n=1). With a median follow-up of 16 months, 14 patients progressed. Estimated progression-free and OS at 2 years were 29% (+/-11%) and 50% (+/-12%), respectively. At last follow-up, eight patients were alive (first CR, n=4; second CR, n=2; PR, n=1; PD, n=1). Eleven patients died of PD. Median time-to-progression was 14 months. Selected patients with AT/RT might benefit from HDCT with radiotherapy. The definitive impact of this treatment modality has to be evaluated prospectively in a randomized trial.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>49 (3), 370-5</Feld596><PubVol>49</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>370</StrtPage><EndPage>5</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Benesch M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Bartelheim K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Fleischhack G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Gruhn B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schlegel PG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Witt O" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Stachel KD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Hauch H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Urban C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Quehenberger F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Massimino M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Pietsch T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Hasselblatt M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Giangaspero F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Kordes U" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Schneppenheim R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Hauser P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Klingebiel T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="18" name="Fruehwald MC" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24419520</PMID><KST>G340</KST></row><row><publishedID>57670</publishedID><Artikel>Epigenetic epidemiology of cancer</Artikel><Journal>Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>455 (1-2), 70-83</Feld596><PubVol>455</PubVol><PubIss>1-2</PubIss><StrtPage>70</StrtPage><EndPage>83</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Barrow TM" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Michels KB" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25124661</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.bbrc.2014.08.002</DOI><KST>L601</KST></row><row><publishedID>57711</publishedID><Artikel>The complement receptors CD46, CD55 and CD59 are regulated by the tumour microenvironment of head and neck cancer to facilitate escape of complement attack</Artikel><Journal>European Journal of Cancer</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>50 (12), 2152-2161</Feld596><PubVol>50</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>2152</StrtPage><EndPage>2161</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kesselring R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Thiel A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Pries R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Fichtner-Feigl S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Brunner S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Seidel P" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Bruchhage KL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Wollenberg B" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24915776</PMID><KST>E210</KST></row><row><publishedID>57758</publishedID><Artikel>Hippocampal synaptic plasticity, spatial memory and anxiety</Artikel><Journal>Nature Reviews Neuroscience</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>15 (3), 181-192</Feld596><PubVol>15</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>181</StrtPage><EndPage>192</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Bannerman DM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name=", Sprengel R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Sanderson DJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="McHugh SB" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Rawlins JN" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Monyer H" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="6" name="Seeburg PH" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24552786</PMID><DOI>10.1038/nrn3677</DOI><KST>A230</KST></row><row><publishedID>57827</publishedID><Artikel>Tax contributes apoptosis resistance to HTLV-1-infected T cells via suppression of Bid and Bim expression</Artikel><Journal>Cell Death and Disease</Journal><ABSTr>The human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the etiological agent of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). HTLV-1 Tax has been shown to have a prosurvival role in infected T cells by enhancing expression of the Bcl-2 family of antiapoptotic proteins. In this study, we show that the expression of proapoptotic BH3-only proteins Bim (Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death) and Bid (BH3-interacting domain death agonist) is diminished in HTLV-1-infected leukemic cells. Using a Tax-inducible system and a transient overexpression approach, we demonstrate that Tax downregulates Bid and Bim expression at the transcriptional level. We show that reinforced expression of Bim and Bid in HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines sensitizes CD95/TRAIL- and anticancer drug-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we show that Tax suppresses Bid and Bim expression by enhancing hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) protein expression. siRNA knockdown of HIF-1 alpha or chemical inhibition of the transactivation activity of HIF-1 alpha resulted in an increase in Bid and Bim expression and, consequently, in an increase in CD95/TRAIL- and anticancer drug-induced apoptosis in HTLV-1-infected leukemic T-cell lines. Our study provides evidence that besides upregulation of prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins, Tax may also confer apoptosis resistance to HTLV-1-infected T cells by suppressing the expression of the proapoptotic BH3-only proteins Bim and Bid.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>18 (5), e1575-</Feld596><PubVol>18</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>e1575</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Muehleisen A" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Giaisi M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Koehler R" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Krammer PH" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Li-Weber M."

Purpose of this work was to investigate the robustness of scanned-beam particle therapy plans against setup errors for different optimization modalities, beam setups and ion species.

Material and methods: For 15 patients with skull base tumors, localized in regions of severe tissue density heterogeneity, scanned lateral-opposed-beam treatment plans were prepared with the treatment planning system TRiP98, employing different optimization settings (single-and multiple-field modulation) and ion species (carbon ions and protons). For 10 of the patients, additional plans were prepared with individually selected beam setups, aiming at avoiding severe tissue heterogeneities. Subsequently, multiple rigid positioning errors of magnitude 1-2 mm (i.e. within planning target expansion) were simulated by introducing a shift of the irradiation fields with respect to the computed tomography (CT) data and recomputing the plans.

Results: In presence of shifts, in carbon ion plans using a lateral-opposed beam setup and fulfilling clinical healthy tissue dose constraints, the median reduction in CTV V-95% was up to 0.7 percentage points (pp) and 3.5 pp, for shifts of magnitude 1 mm and 2 mm respectively, however, in individual cases, the reduction reached 5.1 pp and 9.7 pp. In the corresponding proton plans similar median CTV V-95% reductions of up to 0.9 pp (1 mm error) and 3.4 pp (2 mm error) were observed, with respective individual-case reductions of at most 3.2 pp and 11.7 pp. Unconstrained plans offered slightly higher coverage values, while no relevant differences were observed between different field modulation methods. Individually selected beam setups had a visible dosimetric advantage over lateral-opposed beams, for both particle species. While carbons provided more conformal plans and generally more advantageous absolute dose values, in presence of setup errors, protons showed greater dosimetric stability, in most of the investigated scenarios.

Conclusion: Residual patient setup errors may lead to substantial dose perturbation in scanned-beam particle therapy of skull base tumors, which cannot be dealt with by planning target expansion alone. Choice of irradiation directions avoiding extreme density heterogeneities can improve plan stability against such delivery-time uncertainties.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (), Art.

Many immunotherapeutic regimens are now approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for use in cancer patients, and many others are being investigated as standalone therapeutic interventions or combined with conventional treatments in clinical studies. Immunotherapies may be subdivided into "passive" and "active" based on their ability to engage the host immune system against cancer. Since the anticancer activity of most passive immunotherapeutics (including tumor-targeting monoclonal antibodies) also relies on the host immune system, this classification does not properly reflect the complexity of the drug-host-tumor interaction. Alternatively, anticancer immunotherapeutics can be classified according to their antigen specificity. While some immunotherapies specifically target one (or a few) defined tumor-associated antigen(s), others operate in a relatively non-specific manner and boost natural or therapy-elicited anticancer immune responses of unknown and often broad specificity. Here, we propose a critical, integrated classification of anticancer immunotherapies and discuss the clinical relevance of these approaches.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>5 (24),

However, molecular interactions between these therapeutics have not been studied so far. A transcriptional profiling of tumor cells incubated with SFKs inhibitors revealed strong downregulation of MS4A1 gene encoding CD20 antigen. In a panel of primary and established B-cell tumors we observed that SFKs inhibitors strongly affect CD20 expression at the transcriptional level, leading to inhibition of anti-CD20 mAbs binding and increased resistance of tumor cells to complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Activation of the AKT signaling pathway significantly protected cells from dasatinib-triggered CD20 downregulation. Additionally, SFKs inhibitors suppressed antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity by direct inhibition of natural killer cells. Abrogation of antitumor activity of rituximab was also observed in vivo in a mouse model. Noteworthy, the effects of SFKs inhibitors on NK cell function are largely reversible. The results of our studies indicate that development of optimal combinations of novel treatment modalities with anti-CD20 mAbs should be preceded by detailed preclinical evaluation of their effects on target cells.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>6 (5), 1300-1313</Feld596><PubVol>6</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>1300</StrtPage><EndPage>1313</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Winiarska M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Bojarczuk K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Pyrzynska B" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Bil J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Siernicka M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Dwojak M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Bobrowicz M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Miazek N" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Zapala P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Zagozdzon A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Krol M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Syta A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Podszywalow-Bartnicka P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Pilch Z" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Dabrowska-Iwanicka A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Juszczynski P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Efremov DG" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="17" name="Slabicki M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="18" name="Zenz T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="19" name="Roy AL" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="20" name="Olive D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="21" name="Rygiel TP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="22" name="Leusen JH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="23" name="Golab J" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25517315</PMID><KST>G100</KST></row><row><publishedID>57970</publishedID><Artikel>Immunogenicity assessment of HPV16/18 vaccine using the glutathione S-transferase L1 multiplex serology assay</Artikel><Journal>Human Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics</Journal><ABSTr>The glutathione S-transferase (GST)-L1 multiplex serology assay has favorable properties for use in clinical trials and epidemiologic studies, including low cost, high throughput capacity, and low serum volume requirement. Therefore, we evaluated the GST-L1 assay as a measure of HPV16/18 vaccine immunogenicity. Our study population included 65 women selected from the Costa Rica Vaccine Trial who received the bivalent HPV16/18 virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine at the recommended 0/1/6-month schedule. We tested replicate serum samples from months 0/1/12 (i.e., after 0/1/3 doses) by GST-L1 and 3 other commonly used serology assays, VLP-ELISA, SEAP-NA, and cLIA. We calculated the percentage of women seropositive by GST-L1 by time point and HPV type (14 HPV types), and compared GST-L1 to other assays using Spearman rank correlation coefficients. After 1 vaccine dose, seropositivity by GST-L1 was 40% each for HPV16 and HPV18, increasing to 100% and 98%, respectively, after 3 doses. Seropositivity after 3 doses ranged from 32% to 69% for HPV types 31/33/45, for which partial vaccine efficacy is reported, though increases also occurred for types with no evidence for cross-protection (e.g., HPV77). GST-L1 correlated best after 3 doses with VLP-ELISA (HPV16 and HPV18 each rho = 0.72) and SEAP-NA (HPV16 rho = 0.65, HPV18 rho = 0.71) (all P &lt; 0.001); correlation was lower with cLIA. The GST-L1 is suitable for evaluating HPV16/18 vaccine immunogenicity after 3 vaccine doses, although in contrast to other assays it may classify some samples as HPV16/18 seronegative. The assay's utility is limited for lower antibody levels such as after receipt of 1 dose.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>10 (10), 2965-2974</Feld596><PubVol>10</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>2965</StrtPage><EndPage>2974</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Robbins HA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Waterboer T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Porras C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Kemp TJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Pawlita M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Rodriguez AC" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Wacholder S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Gonzalez P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Schiller JT" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Lowy DR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Esser M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Matys K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Poncelet S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Herrero R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Hildesheim A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Pinto LA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Safaeian M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25483632</PMID><DOI>10.4161/21645515.2014.972811</DOI><KST>F020</KST><KEYWORD>HPV-16/18 AS04-ADJUVANTED VACCINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IMMUNIZATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NEUTRALIZING EPITOPES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TYPE-18</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS TYPES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>COSTA-RICA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANTIBODY-RESPONSES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EFFICACY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>VIRUS-LIKE PARTICLES</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRIAL</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>57979</publishedID><Artikel>Whole recombinant Pichia pastoris expressing HPV16 L1 antigen is superior in inducing protection against tumor growth as compared to killed transgenic Leishmania</Artikel><Journal>Human Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>10 (12), 3499-3508</Feld596><PubVol>10</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>3499</StrtPage><EndPage>3508</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Bolhassani A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Mueller M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Roohvand F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Motevalli F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Agi E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Shokri M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Tatamedi Rad M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Hosseinzahdeh S" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25668661</PMID><DOI>10.4161/21645515.2014.979606</DOI><KST>F035</KST></row><row><publishedID>58330</publishedID><Artikel>ShaPINg cell fate upon DNA damage: Role of Pin1 in DNA damage-induced cell death and repair</Artikel><Journal>Frontiers in Oncology</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>4 (), 148-</Feld596><PubVol>4</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>148</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Polonio-Vallon T" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Krueger D" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Hofmann TG" IsDKFZ="1"/><KST>A210</KST></row><row><publishedID>58331</publishedID><Artikel>Cytosolic thiol switches regulating basic cellular functions: GAPDH as an information hub?</Artikel><Journal>Biological Chemistry</Journal><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596> (), doi: 10.1515/hsz-2014-0295.-</Feld596><PubVol/><PubIss/><StrtPage>doi: 10.1515/hsz-2014-0295.</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Hildebrandt T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Knuesting J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Berndt C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Morgan B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Scheibe R" IsDKFZ="0"/><KST>A160</KST></row><row><publishedID>58396</publishedID><Artikel>Repetitive centromeric satellite RNA is essential for kinetochore formation and cell division</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Cell Biology</Journal><ABSTr>Chromosome segregation requires centromeres on every sister chromatid to correctly form and attach the microtubule spindle during cell division. Even though centromeres are essential for genome stability, the underlying centromeric DNA is highly variable in sequence and evolves quickly. Epigenetic mechanisms are therefore thought to regulate centromeres. Here, we show that the 359-bp repeat satellite III (SAT III), which spans megabases on the X chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster, produces a long noncoding RNA that localizes to centromeric regions of all major chromosomes. Depletion of SAT III RNA causes mitotic defects, not only of the sex chromosome but also in trans of all autosomes. We furthermore find that SAT III RNA binds to the kinetochore component CENP-C, and is required for correct localization of the centromere-defining proteins CENP-A and CENP-C, as well as outer kinetochore proteins. In conclusion, our data reveal that SAT III RNA is an integral part of centromere identity, adding RNA to the complex epigenetic mark at centromeres in flies.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>207 (3), 335-349</Feld596><PubVol>207</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>335</StrtPage><EndPage>349</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Rosic,S."

MT-associated protein 1S (MAP1S), the most ubiquitously expressed MAP1 family member, is required for accurate cell division. Here, using quantitative analysis of MT plus-end tracking, we show that MAP1S knockdown alters MT dynamics throughout the cell cycle. Surprisingly, MAP1S downregulation results in faster growing, yet short-lived, MTs in all cell cycle stages and in a global loss of MT acetylation. These aberrations correlate with severe defects in the final stages of cell division. In monopolar cytokinesis assays, we demonstrate that MAP1S guides MT-dependent initiation of cytokinesis. Our data underline the key role of MAP1S as a global regulator of MT stability and demonstrate a new primary function of MAP1S to regulate MT dynamics at the onset of cytokinesis.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>127 (23), 5007-5013</Feld596><PubVol>127</PubVol><PubIss>23</PubIss><StrtPage>5007</StrtPage><EndPage>5013</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Tegha-Dunghu,J."

To identify their protein targets in the host cells, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens, allowing us to find 48 high-confidence protein-protein interactions between 15 EHEC effectors and 47 human host proteins. In comparison to other bacteria and viruses we found that EHEC effectors bind more frequently to hub proteins as well as to proteins that participate in a higher number of protein complexes. The data set includes six new interactions that involve the translocated intimin receptor (TIR), namely HPCAL1, HPCAL4, NCALD, ARRB1, PDE6D, and STK16. We compared these TIR interactions in EHEC and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and found that five interactions were conserved. Notably, the conserved interactions included those of serine/threonine kinase 16 (STK16), hippocalcin-like 1 (HPCAL1) as well as neurocalcin-delta (NCALD). These proteins co-localize with the infection sites of EPEC. Furthermore, our results suggest putative functions of poorly characterized effectors (EspJ, EspY1). In particular, we observed that EspJ is connected to the microtubule system while EspY1 appears to be involved in apoptosis/cell cycle regulation.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>4 (), Art.

To demonstrate its application we first duplicated the promoter of the FAR1 gene in yeast and simultaneously inserted a GFP downstream of it. This created a reporter for promoter activity while leaving the FAR1 gene fully intact. In another experiment, we used PCR duplication to increase the dosage of a gene in a discrete manner, from 1x to 2x. Using TUB4, the gene encoding for the yeast gamma-tubulin, we validated that this led to corresponding increases in the levels of mRNA and protein. PCR duplication is an easy one-step procedure that can be adapted in different ways to permit rapid, disturbance-free investigation of various genomic regulatory elements without the need for ex vivo cloning.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (12), e114590-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>e114590</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Huber,F."

L1CAM is an established biomarker for the latter cancers and we showed before that approximately 18% of primary breast cancers are positive for L1CAM and have a bad prognosis. Here we analysed the expression of L1CAM breast cancer subtypes.

Methods: We analyzed mRNA and protein expression data from different breast cancer cohorts for L1CAM, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, Her-2 and Androgen receptor (AR) and correlated the data. We performed Western blot analysis on tumor cell lysates and carried out chromatin-immuno-precipitation (CHIP) after AR overexpression.

Results: We find that L1CAM is expressed preferentially though not exclusively in TNBCs. Using the human cancer genome atlas database and two independent breast cancer cohorts we find that L1CAM is inversely correlated with androgen receptor (AR) expression. We found that L1CAM(high)AR(low) primary breast tumors have the worst clinical outcome. Overexpression of AR in MDA-MB436 breast cancer cells decreased L1CAM expression at the protein and mRNA level and CHIP-analysis revealed binding of AR to the L1CAM promoter region.

Conclusions: These results suggest that L1CAM in breast cancer is under AR control. The data also strongly advocate the use of L1CAM assessment in breast cancer diagnosis. We suggest that L1CAM expression could be causally related to the bad prognosis of TNBCs.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>14 (), Art.

In mouse models, corneal NV can be artificially induced to investigate mechanisms of corneal pathologies. However, mouse models of corneal NV are not restricted to cornea-specific research, but also are widely used to investigate general mechanisms of angiogenesis. Because the cornea is transparent and easily accessible, corneal NV models are among the most useful in vivo models in angiogenesis research.

The three different approaches that are used to study corneal NV in mice are based on direct application of proangiogenic or antiangiogenic transmitters, external injury to the cornea, or genetically engineered mice, which spontaneously develop corneal NV. The aim of this review is to compare the scope and limitations of the different approaches for corneal NV in mice. Our main focus is to highlight the potential of transgenic spontaneous models of corneal NV. Transgenic models do not require any experimental interference and make it possible to investigate different interconnected proangiogenic signaling cascades. As a result, transgenic models are highly useful for disease-centered angiogenesis research.

In summary, transgenic models of corneal NV will complement and advance existing ocular NV assays, and help to discover new angiogenesis-related treatment strategies for ocular and extraocular diseases.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>55 (11), 7637-7651</Feld596><PubVol>55</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>7637</StrtPage><EndPage>7651</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Kather,J.N."

The identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may help explain the heterogeneity of neuroblastoma and assist in identifying patients at higher risk for poor survival. SNPs in the TP53 pathway are of special importance, as several studies have reported associations between TP53 pathway SNPs and cancer. Of note, less than 2% of neuroblastoma tumors have a TP53 mutation at diagnosis.

Patients and Methods: We selected 21 of the most frequently studied SNPs in the TP53 pathway and evaluated their association with outcome in 500 neuroblastoma patients using TaqMan allelic discrimination assays.

Results and Conclusion: We investigated the impact of 21 SNPs on overall survival, event-free survival, age at diagnosis, MYCN status, and stage of the disease in 500 neuroblastoma patients. A missense SNP in exon 10 of the CASP8 gene SNP D302H was associated with worse overall and event-free survival in patients with MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma tumors.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (12), e114696-</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>12</PubIss><StrtPage>e114696</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Rihani,A."

We constructed oncolytic viruses armed with an inhibitor of deacetylation and/or p73 to specifically target metastatic cancer. Arming of the viruses is aimed at lifting epigenetic blockage and re-opening apoptotic programs in a staggered manner enabling both, efficient virus replication and balanced destruction of target cells through apoptosis. Our results showed that cooperative expression of shHDAC1 and p73 efficiently enhances apoptosis induction and autophagy of infected cells which reinforces progeny production. In vitro analyses revealed 100% cytotoxicity after infecting cells with OV.shHDAC1.p73 at a lower virus dose compared to control viruses. Intriguingly, OV.shHDAC1.p73 acts as a potent inhibitor of highly metastatic xenograft tumors in vivo. Tumor expansion was significantly reduced after intratumoral injection of 3 x 10(8) PFU of either OV.shHDAC1 or OV.p73 and, most important, complete regression could be achieved in 100 % of tumors treated with OV.shHDAC1.p73. Our results point out that the combination of high replication capacity and simultaneous restoration of cell death routes significantly enhance antitumor activity.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>5 (15), 5893-5907</Feld596><PubVol>5</PubVol><PubIss>15</PubIss><StrtPage>5893</StrtPage><EndPage>5907</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schipper,H."

Rapidly collecting/pooling data can accelerate 'translational research in radiation therapy and oncology. The exchange of study data is one of the fundamental principles behind data aggregation and data mining. The possibilities of reproducing the original study results, performing further analyses on existing research data to generate new hypotheses or developing computational models to support medical decisions (e.g. risk/benefit analysis of treatment options) represent just a fraction of the potential benefits of medical data-pooling. Distributed machine learning and knowledge exchange from federated databases can be considered as one beyond other attractive approaches for knowledge generation within "Big Data". Data interoperability between research institutions should be the major concern behind a wider collaboration. Information captured in electronic patient records (EPRs) and study case report forms (eCRFs), linked together with medical imaging and treatment planning data, are deemed to be fundamental elements for large multi-centre studies in the field of radiation therapy and oncology. To fully utilise the captured medical information, the study data have to be more than just an electronic version of a traditional (un-modifiable) paper CRF. Challenges that have to be addressed are data interoperability, utilisation of standards, data quality and privacy concerns, data ownership, rights to publish, data pooling architecture and storage. This paper discusses a framework for conceptual packages of ideas focused on a strategic development for international research data exchange in the field of radiation therapy and oncology.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>113 (3), 303-309</Feld596><PubVol>113</PubVol><PubIss>3</PubIss><StrtPage>303</StrtPage><EndPage>309</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Skripcak,T."

Starting in October 2007, the patient was treated with LHT, oncolytic virotherapy and DC vaccination. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-levels, with the highest level of 233.8 ng/ml in January 2008, decreased to 0.8 ng/ml in late February 2008. In March 2008, a reduction in bone metastases could be detected by positron emission tomography/computed tomography. Since then, the PSA levels have remained low and the patient is doing. well.

Klotho, a transmembrane protein, protease and hormone mainly expressed in kidney is involved in the regulation of renal phosphate excretion and also retains renal protective effects. Renal failure is associated with renal depletion of klotho. The present study explored the influence of Shiga toxin 2 on renal klotho expression. METHODS: Mice were injected with either solvent or Shiga toxin 2 and urinary flow rate and phosphate excretion were determined in metabolic cages. Renal transcript levels were measured by quantitative RT-PCR and renal protein abundance by Western blotting. Plasma concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D3 and FGF23 were determined by ELISA and plasma phosphate and urea concentrations by photometry. RESULTS: Shiga toxin 2 treatment was followed by increase of plasma urea concentration, urinary flow rate and renal phosphate excretion but not of plasma phosphate concentration. Shiga toxin 2 treatment strongly decreased klotho mRNA expression and klotho protein abundance in renal tissue. Shiga toxin 2 treatment further increased tumor necrosis factor (Tnfalpha) mRNA levels, as well as protein abundance of phosphorylated p38 MAPK in renal tissue. The treatment significantly increased renal Cyp27b1 and decreased renal Cyp24a1 mRNA levels without significantly altering plasma 1,25(OH)2D3 levels. Shiga toxin 2 treatment was further followed by increase of plasma FGF23 concentrations. CONCLUSION: Shiga toxin 2 treatment stimulated Tnfalpha transcription, down-regulated renal klotho expression and increased FGF23 formation, effects presumably contributing to renal tissue injury.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>39 (5), 441-449</Feld596><PubVol>39</PubVol><PubIss>5</PubIss><StrtPage>441</StrtPage><EndPage>449</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Feger M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Mia S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Pakladok T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Nicolay JP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Alesutan I" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Schneider SW" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Voelkl J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Lang F" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25471359</PMID><DOI>10.1159/000368457</DOI><KST>D030</KST><KEYWORD>MICE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GENE-EXPRESSION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MODEL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>EPITHELIAL-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ESCHERICHIA-COLI</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HEMOLYTIC-UREMIC SYNDROME</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANGIOTENSIN-II</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>P38 MAP KINASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHRONIC KIDNEY-DISEASE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>58840</publishedID><Artikel>Neural network activity and neurological soft signs in healthy adults</Artikel><Journal>Behavioural Brain Research</Journal><ABSTr>Previous neuroimaging studies in schizophrenia have shown that neurological soft signs (NSS) are associated with abnormal brain structure and function, but it remains unclear whether these findings truly reflect pathological processes or if they may be confounded by antipsychotics. To address these issues, structural neuroimaging studies conducted in healthy populations have shown an association between NSS and cortical regions but to date, studies of brain function in healthy participants are scarce. In this study, using functional magnetic resonance imaging we investigated 37 healthy adults under "resting-state" conditions. Functional connectivity of motor cortical and subcortical neural networks was assessed using a group spatial independent component analysis (ICA). NSS were measured using the "Heidelberg Scale". The relationship between functional connectivity at rest and NSS was analyzed using a regression model where age, gender and movement parameters were included as nuisance variables. We identified 35 stable components, from which five networks of interest were chosen for further analyses. Within three motor cortical networks, negative correlations were found between NSS levels and functional connectivity of the right precuneus, right superior frontal areas, supplementary motor area, and left paracentral gyrus. There were no significant associations between NSS scores and striatal or thalamic connectivity. In conclusion, the data indicate that in healthy young adults NSS are associated with regionally confined levels of cortical activity and not with striatal or thalamic function. The neural mechanisms underlying NSS in healthy individuals appear to rely on cortically mediated motor control and planning to a higher degree than on functions subserved by subcortical structures.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>278C (), 514-519</Feld596><PubVol>278C</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>514</StrtPage><EndPage>519</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Thomann PA" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Hirjak D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kubera KM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Stieltjes B" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="4" name="Wolf RC" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25446752</PMID><DOI>10.1016/j.bbr.2014.10.044</DOI><KST>E011</KST><KEYWORD>1ST-EPISODE SCHIZOPHRENIA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>brain</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INTRINSIC CONNECTIVITY NETWORKS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GO/NO-GO TASKS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RESPONSE-INHIBITION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>INDEPENDENT COMPONENTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>FUNCTIONAL NETWORKS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANTERIOR CINGULATE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RESTING-STATE</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>58846</publishedID><Artikel>Growing with the wind Ribosomal protein hydroxylation and cell growth</Artikel><Journal>Fly</Journal><ABSTr>In this Extra View we comment on our recent work on Sudestada1 (Sud1), a Drosophila 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent dioxygenase that belongs to the Ribosomal Oxygenase (ROX) subfamily.

Each of these steps are tightly regulated, affecting the final dynamics of protein abundance. Various regulatory mechanisms exist at the translation step, rendering mRNA levels alone an unreliable indicator of gene expression. In addition, local regulation of mRNA translation has been particularly implicated in neuronal functions, shifting 'translatomics' to the focus of attention in neurobiology. The presented method can be used to bridge transcriptomics and proteomics. Here we describe essential modifications to the technique of polyribosome fractionation, which interrogates the translatome based on the association of actively translated mRNAs to multiple ribosomes and their differential sedimentation in sucrose gradients. Traditionally, working with in vivo samples, particularly of the central nervous system (CNS), has proven challenging due to the restricted amounts of material and the presence of fatty tissue components. In order to address this, the described protocol is specifically optimized for use with minimal amount of CNS material, as demonstrated by the use of single mouse spinal cord and brain. Briefly, CNS tissues are extracted and translating ribosomes are immobilized on mRNAs with cycloheximide. Myelin flotation is then performed to remove lipid rich components. Fractionation is performed on a sucrose gradient where mRNAs are separated according to their ribosomal loading.

Toward this ultimate goal, it is essential to develop an inducible model mimicking the long-lasting disease progression. In the current study, we have established a novel -cell ablation mouse model, in which the -cell mass progressively declines, as seen in type 1 diabetes. The model is based on the -cell specific genetic ablation of the transcription initiation factor 1A, TIF-IA, essential for RNA Polymerase I activity (TIF-IA(/)). Using this approach, we induced a slow apoptotic response that eventually leads to a protracted -cell death. In this model, we observed -cell regeneration that resulted in a complete recovery of the -cell mass and normoglycemia. In addition, we showed that adaptive proliferation of remaining -cells is the prominent mechanism acting to compensate for the massive -cell loss in young but also aged mice. Interestingly, at any age, we also detected -like cells expressing the glucagon hormone, suggesting a transition between - and -cell identities or vice versa. Taken together, the TIF-IA(/) mouse model can be used to investigate the potential therapeutic approaches for type 1 diabetes targeting -cell regeneration.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>13 (24), 3948-3957</Feld596><PubVol>13</PubVol><PubIss>24</PubIss><StrtPage>3948</StrtPage><EndPage>3957</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Shamsi,F."

Heavy ion therapy has shown promising results in the treatment of recurrent colorectal carcinoma. The present study evaluates the effect of five different cytostatic agents in combination with radiotherapy with carbon (C12) ions and photons in two isogenic colorectal cancer cell lines differing in p53 status. Methods and study design. Clonogenic survival analyses were performed using the human colon cancer cell lines HCT 116 wt and the isogenic p53 deficient cell line HCT 116 p53 -/-. Single photon doses (6 MV X-rays) up to 10 Gy were applied using a linear accelerator. Carbon ion irradiation up to 3 Gy was performed at the Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy Center with the horizontal beamline delivering an extended Bragg peak with an average linear energy transfer of 103 keV/microm. Five different cytostatic agents were applied in combinations with photon and carbon ion radiotherapy. Results. Both cell lines showed a similar response to photons and carbon ions, whereas treatment with carbon ions resulted in a superior relative biological efficiency. Irinotecan and paclitaxel alone showed high toxicity in the treatment of wildtype cells. A notable difference was observed on the cell death of p53 -/- cell lines. Here, single treatment with paclitaxel and gemcitabine resulted in good response rates. Combinations of carbon ions with gemcitabine, irinotecan or paclitaxel revealed high response rates. After irradiation with carbon ions and temozolomide, cell survival rates depended on p53 status, with a decreased survival rate in wildtype cells. Conclusions. Irinotecan and paclitaxel are an effective treatment for HCT 116 wt cells, whereas HCT 116 cells with p53 deficiency can be treated successfully with paclitaxel and gemcitabine. Combined treatment modalities with carbon ions and chemotherapy provide great effectiveness that may offer new treatment opportunities for recurrent colorectal cancer in the future.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>100 (6), 675-684</Feld596><PubVol>100</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>675</StrtPage><EndPage>684</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Adeberg S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Baris D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Habermehl D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Rieken S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Brons S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Weber KJ" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Roth W" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Debus J" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Combs SE" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25688502</PMID><DOI>10.1700/1778.19278</DOI><KST>E050</KST><KST>G150</KST><KEYWORD>CAMPTOTHECIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SURVIVAL</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>radiotherapy</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>APOPTOSIS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RADIATION-THERAPY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>X-RAYS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROGNOSTIC-FACTORS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>GLIOBLASTOMA</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA TOPOISOMERASE-I</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>RECTAL-CANCER</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>59005</publishedID><Artikel>Investigation of taxa of the family Pasteurellaceae isolated from Syrian and European hamsters and proposal of Mesocricetibacter intestinalis gen. nov., sp. nov. and Cricetibacter osteomyelitidis gen. nov., sp. nov</Artikel><Journal>International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology</Journal><ABSTr>Eleven strains from hamster of Bisgaard taxa 23 and 24, also referred to as Krause's groups 2 and 1, respectively, were investigated by a polyphasic approach including data published previously. Strains showed small, regular and circular colonies with smooth and shiny appearance, typical of members of the family Pasteurellaceae. The strains formed two monophyletic groups based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison to other members of the family Pasteurellaceae. Partial rpoB sequencing as well as published data on DNA-DNA hybridization showed high genotypic relationships within both groups. Menaquinone 7 (MK7) was found in strains of both groups as well as an unknown ubiquinone with shorter chain length than previously reported for any other member of the family Pasteurellaceae.

However, less is known about the interrelationships of common variants in the CYP19A1 gene, daily levels of oestrogens, mammographic density phenotypes, and body mass index (BMI) in premenopausal women.MethodsBased on plausible biological mechanisms related to the oestrogen pathway, we investigated the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CYP19A1, 17ss-estradiol and mammographic density in 202 premenopausal women. DNA was genotyped using the Illumina Golden Gate platform. Daily salivary 17ss-estradiol concentrations were measured throughout an entire menstrual cycle. Mammographic density phenotypes were assessed using a computer-assisted method (Madena). We determined associations using multivariable linear and logistic regression models.ResultsThe minor alleles of rs749292 were positively (P inverted question mark= inverted question mark0.026), and the minor alleles of rs7172156 were inversely (P inverted question mark= inverted question mark0.002) associated with daily 17ss-estradiol. We observed an 87% lower level of daily 17ss-estradiol throughout a menstrual cycle in heavier women (BMI &gt;23.6 kg/m2) of rs7172156 with minor genotype aa compared with major genotype AA. Furthermore, the rs749292 minor alleles were inversely associated with absolute mammographic density (P inverted question mark= inverted question mark0.032). Lean women with rs749292 minor alleles had 70 to 80% lower risk for high absolute mammographic density (&gt;32.4 cm2); Aa: odds ratio (OR) inverted question mark= inverted question mark0.23 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.75). Lean women with rs7172156 minor homozygous genotype had OR 5.45 for high absolute mammographic density (aa: OR inverted question mark= inverted question mark5.45 (95% CI 1.13 to 26.3)).ConclusionOur findings suggest that two SNPs in CYP19A1, rs749292 and rs7172156, are associated with both daily oestrogen levels and mammographic density phenotypes. Body mass index may modify these associations, but larger studies are needed.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>16 (6), Art. Nr.:499-</Feld596><PubVol>16</PubVol><PubIss>6</PubIss><StrtPage>Art.

In this study, we investigated the role of CD4(+)Foxp3(+) Treg in a mouse model of CAC and in patients with colon cancer. These Treg were increased strongly in number in a mouse model of CAC and in the peripheral blood of patients with colon cancer, exhibiting an activated phenotype as defined by elevated expression of GARP, CD103, CTLA-4, and IL10, along with an increased suppressive effect on the proliferation and Th1 cytokine expression of CD4(+)CD25(-) responder T cells ex vivo. Transient ablation of CD4(+)Foxp3(+) Treg during tumor development in the CAC model suppressed tumor outgrowth and distribution, accompanied by an increased number of CD8(+)IFNgamma/granzyme B-producing effector T cells. Conversely, inactivation of IL10 in Treg did not elevate the antitumor response but instead further boosted tumor development. Our results establish a tumor-promoting function for Treg during CAC formation, but they also suggest that a selective, transient ablation of Treg can evoke antitumor responses, with implications for immunotherapeutic interventions in patients with CAC.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>74 (16), 4258-4269</Feld596><PubVol>74</PubVol><PubIss>16</PubIss><StrtPage>4258</StrtPage><EndPage>4269</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Pastille E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Bardini K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Fleissner D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Adamczyk A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Frede A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Wadwa M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="von Smolinski D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Kasper S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Sparwasser T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Gruber AD" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Schuler M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="11" name="Sakaguchi S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Roers A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Muller W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Hansen W" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Buer J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="16" name="Westendorf AM" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>24906621</PMID><KST>L401</KST></row><row><publishedID>59142</publishedID><Artikel>Prognostic impact of Bcl-2 depends on tumor histology and expression of MALAT-1 lncRNA in non-small-cell lung cancer</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Thoracic Oncology</Journal><ABSTr>INTRODUCTION: Apoptosis is a crucial pathway in tumor growth and metastatic development. Apoptotic proteins regulate the underlying molecular cascades and are thought to modulate the tumor response to chemotherapy and radiation. However, the prognostic value of the expression of apoptosis regulators in localized non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still unclear. METHODS: We investigated the protein expression of apoptosis regulators Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, Mcl-1, and pp32/PHAPI, and the expression of the lncRNA MALAT-1 in tumor samples from 383 NSCLC patients (median age: 65.6 years; 77.5% male; paraffin-embedded tissue microarrays). For statistical analysis correlation tests, Log rank tests and Cox proportional hazard models were applied. RESULTS: Tumor histology was significantly associated with the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xl and Mcl-1 (all p &lt; 0.001). Among the tested apoptotic markers only Bcl-2 demonstrated prognostic impact (hazard ratio = 0.64, p = 0.012). For NSCLC patients with non-adenocarcinoma histology, Bcl-2 expression was associated with increased overall survival (p = 0.036). Besides tumor histology, prognostic impact of Bcl-2 was also found to depend on MALAT-1 lncRNA expression. Gene expression analysis of A549 adenocarcinoma cells with differential MALAT-1 lncRNA expression demonstrated an influence on the expression of Bcl-2 and its interacting proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Bcl-2 expression was specifically associated with superior prognosis in localized NSCLC. An interaction of Bcl-2 with MALAT-1 lncRNA expression was revealed, which merits further investigation for risk prediction in resectable NSCLC patients.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>9 (9), 1294-1304</Feld596><PubVol>9</PubVol><PubIss>9</PubIss><StrtPage>1294</StrtPage><EndPage>1304</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schmidt LH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Gorlich D" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Spieker T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Rohde C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Schuler M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Mohr M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Humberg J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Sauer T" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Thoenissen NH" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Huge A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="10" name="Voss R" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="11" name="Marra A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="12" name="Faldum A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="13" name="Muller-Tidow C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="14" name="Berdel WE" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="15" name="Wiewrodt R" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25036876</PMID><KST>L401</KST></row><row><publishedID>59143</publishedID><Artikel>Experience with afatinib in patients with non-small cell lung cancer progressing after clinical benefit from gefitinib and erlotinib.</Artikel><Journal>Oncology Reports</Journal><ABSTr>BACKGROUND: Afatinib, an irreversible ErbB family blocker, demonstrated superiority to chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Afatinib is also active in patients progressing on EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). We report the results of a large cohort of NSCLC patients receiving afatinib within a compassionate-use program (CUP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced NSCLC progressing after one line or more of chemotherapy and one line or more of EGFR-TKI treatment with either an EGFR mutation or documented clinical benefit were enrolled. Data collection was not monitored or verified by central review. The intention of this CUP was to provide controlled preregistration access to afatinib for patients with life-threatening diseases and no other treatment option. RESULTS: From May 2010 to October 2013, 573 patients (65% female; median age: 64 years [range: 28-89 years]) were enrolled, with strong participation of community oncologists. Comorbidities were allowed, including second malignancies in 11% of patients. EGFR mutation status was available in 391 patients (72%), and 83% tested mutation positive. Median time to treatment failure (TTF) of 541 patients treated with afatinib was 3.7 months (range: 0.0 to &gt;29.0 months). Median TTF was 4.0 and 2.7 months in patients with adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas, respectively, and 4.6 months in patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Adverse events were generally manageable. CONCLUSION: Afatinib was able to be given in a real-world setting to heavily pretreated patients with EGFR-mutated or EGFR-TKI-sensitive NSCLC. Acknowledging the constraints of data collection in a CUP, afatinib appears to be safe and to confer some clinical benefit in this population.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>19 (10), 1100-1109</Feld596><PubVol>19</PubVol><PubIss>10</PubIss><StrtPage>1100</StrtPage><EndPage>1109</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Schuler M" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Fischer JR" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Grohe C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Gutz S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Thomas M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Kimmich M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Schneider CP" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Laack E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Marten A" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25232040</PMID><KST>L401</KST></row><row><publishedID>59145</publishedID><Artikel>Functional expression cloning identifies COX-2 as a suppressor of antigen-specific cancer immunity</Artikel><Journal>Cell Death and Disease</Journal><ABSTr>The efficacy of immune surveillance and antigen-specific cancer immunotherapy equally depends on the activation of a sustained immune response targeting cancer antigens and the susceptibility of cancer cells to immune effector mechanisms. Using functional expression cloning and T-cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice, we have identified cyclooxygenase 2/prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (COX-2) as resistance factor against the cytotoxicity induced by activated, antigen-specific T cells. Expressing COX-2, but not a catalytically inactive COX-2 mutant, increased the clonogenic survival of E1A-transformed murine cancer cells when cocultured with lymphocytes from St42Rag2(-/-) mice harboring a transgenic TCR directed against an E1A epitope. COX-2 expressing tumors established in immune-deficient mice were less susceptible to adoptive immunotherapy with TCR transgenic lymphocytes in vivo. Also, immune surveillance of COX-2-positive tumor cells in TCR transgenic mice was less efficient. The growth of murine MC-GP tumors, which show high endogenous COX-2 expression, in immunocompetent mice was effectively suppressed by treatment with a selective COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib. Mechanistically, COX-2 expression blunted the interferon-gamma release of antigen-specific T cells exposed to their respective cellular targets, and increased the expression of interleukin-4 and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase by tumor cells. Addition of interferon-gamma sensitized COX-2 expressing cancer cells to tumor suppression by antigen-specific T cells. In conclusion, COX-2, which is frequently induced in colorectal cancer, contributes to immune evasion and resistance to antigen-specific cancer immunotherapy by local suppression of T-cell effector functions.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>5 (), e1568-</Feld596><PubVol>5</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>e1568</StrtPage><EndPage/><Author Pos="0" name="Gobel C" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Breitenbuecher F" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Kalkavan H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Hahnel PS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kasper S" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hoffarth S" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Merches K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Schild H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Lang KS" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Schuler M" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25501829</PMID><KST>L401</KST></row><row><publishedID>59175</publishedID><Artikel>How stemlike are sphere cultures from long-term cancer cell lines? Lessons from mouse glioma models</Artikel><Journal>Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology</Journal><ABSTr>Cancer stem cells may mediate therapy resistance and recurrence in various types of cancer, including glioblastoma. Cancer stemlike cells can be isolated from long-term cancer cell lines, including glioma lines. Using sphere formation as a model for cancer cell stemness in vitro, we derived sphere cultures from SMA-497, SMA-540, SMA-560, and GL-261 glioma cells. Gene expression and proteomics profiling demonstrated that sphere cultures uniformly showed an elevated expression of stemness-associated genes, notably including CD44. Differences in neural lineage marker expression between nonsphere and sphere cultures were heterogeneous except for a uniform reduction of beta-III-tubulin in sphere cultures. All sphere cultures showed slower growth. Self-renewal capacity was influenced by medium conditions but not nonsphere versus sphere culture phenotype. Sphere cultures were more resistant to irradiation, whereas both nonsphere and sphere cultures were highly resistant to temozolomide. Nonsphere cells formed more aggressive tumors in syngeneic mice than sphere cells in all models except SMA-560. There were no major differences in vascularization or infiltration by T cells or microglia/macrophages between nonsphere and sphere cell-derived tumors implanted in syngeneic hosts. Together, these data indicate that mouse glioma cell lines may be induced in vitro to form spheres that acquire features of stemness, but they do not exhibit a uniform biologic phenotype, thereby challenging the view that they represent a superior model system.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>73 (11), 1062-1077</Feld596><PubVol>73</PubVol><PubIss>11</PubIss><StrtPage>1062</StrtPage><EndPage>1077</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Ahmad M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Frei K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Willscher E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Stefanski A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Kaulich K" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="5" name="Roth P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Stuhler K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Reifenberger G" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="8" name="Binder H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="9" name="Weller M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25289892</PMID><KST>L401</KST></row><row><publishedID>59176</publishedID><Artikel>MicroRNA-mediated down-regulation of NKG2D ligands contributes to glioma immune escape</Artikel><Journal>Oncotarget</Journal><ABSTr>Malignant gliomas are intrinsic brain tumors with a dismal prognosis. They are well-adapted to hypoxic conditions and poorly immunogenic. NKG2D is one of the major activating receptors of natural killer (NK) cells and binds to several ligands (NKG2DL). Here we evaluated the impact of miRNA on the expression of NKG2DL in glioma cells including stem-like glioma cells. Three of the candidate miRNA predicted to target NKG2DL were expressed in various glioma cell lines as well as in glioblastomas in vivo: miR-20a, miR-93 and miR-106b. LNA inhibitor-mediated miRNA silencing up-regulated cell surface NKG2DL expression, which translated into increased susceptibility to NK cell-mediated lysis. This effect was reversed by neutralizing NKG2D antibodies, confirming that enhanced lysis upon miRNA silencing was mediated through the NKG2D system. Hypoxia, a hallmark of glioblastomas in vivo, down-regulated the expression of NKG2DL on glioma cells, associated with reduced susceptibility to NK cell-mediated lysis. This process, however, was not mediated through any of the examined miRNA. Accordingly, both hypoxia and the expression of miRNA targeting NKG2DL may contribute to the immune evasion of glioma cells at the level of the NKG2D recognition pathway. Targeting miRNA may therefore represent a novel approach to increase the immunogenicity of glioblastoma.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>5 (17), 7651-7662</Feld596><PubVol>5</PubVol><PubIss>17</PubIss><StrtPage>7651</StrtPage><EndPage>7662</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Codo P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Weller M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Meister G" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Szabo E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Steinle A" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Wolter M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Reifenberger G" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Roth P" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25277195</PMID><KST>L401</KST></row><row><publishedID>59209</publishedID><Artikel>Ontogenesis of oxytocin pathways in the mammalian brain: late maturation and psychosocial disorders</Artikel><Journal>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy</Journal><ABSTr>Oxytocin (OT), the main neuropeptide of sociality, is expressed in neurons exclusively localized in the hypothalamus. During the last decade, a plethora of neuroendocrine, metabolic, autonomic and behavioral effects of OT has been reported. In the urgency to find treatments to syndromes as invalidating as autism, many clinical trials have been launched in which OT is administered to patients, including adolescents and children. However, the impact of OT on the developing brain and in particular on the embryonic and early postnatal maturation of OT neurons, has been only poorly investigated. In the present review we summarize available (although limited) literature on general features of ontogenetic transformation of the OT system, including determination, migration and differentiation of OT neurons. Next, we discuss trajectories of OT receptors (OTR) in the perinatal period. Furthermore, we provide evidence that early alterations, from birth, in the central OT system lead to severe neurodevelopmental diseases such as feeding deficit in infancy and severe defects in social behavior in adulthood, as described in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Our review intends to propose a hypothesis about developmental dynamics of central OT pathways, which are essential for survival right after birth and for the acquisition of social skills later on. A better understanding of the embryonic and early postnatal maturation of the OT system may lead to better OT-based treatments in PWS or autism.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>8 (), Art.

Since this flavonoid is being considered for human use, the in vivo study of DHM interactions with the cytochrome P450 (CYP) multienzyme system in the respect of metabolic activation of a model food-born carcinogen, benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), is of high importance. Flavonoids of known properties, alpha-naphthoflavone (ANF) and beta-naphthoflavone (BNF) were included into the study to compare their and DHM effects on BaP-DNA adduct formation. METHODS: The flavonoids were administered by oral gavage either 72 hrs prior or simultaneously with a single dose of BaP to experimental rats. The expression of CYP1A1/2 enzymes was examined based on the enzymatic activity with a marker substrate, 7-ethoxyresorufin, and on Western blots. The nuclease P1 version of the 32P-postlabeling assay was used to detect and quantify covalent DNA adducts formed by BaP. RESULTS: Treatment of rats with a single dose of DHM or ANF prior to or simultaneously with BaP did not produce an increase in levels of CYP1A1 and in formation of BaP-DNA adducts in liver. BNF, a known inducer of CYP1A1, showed a synergistic effect on BaP-mediated CYP1A1 induction and BaP activation in liver. Contrary to that, in small intestine the stimulatory effect of BNF on both parameters was not detected. Animal pre-treatment with DHM or ANF before BaP administration resulted in a significant elevation of BaP-DNA adducts, namely in the distal part of small intestine, while the CYP1A1 mediated 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylation (EROD) was decreased markedly. It is important to note that under all regimens of animal treatment, DHM or ANF produced the higher inhibitory effect on the BaP-DNA adduct formation and BaP-induced EROD activity of CYP1A1 when administered simultaneously than sequentially with BaP. Our data show that DHM or ANF did not enhance the BaP-activation leading to BaP-mediated genotoxicity (the formation of BaP-DNA adducts) in rat liver, however, in small intestine the pre-treatment of rats with these flavonoids may enhance BaP genotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that the intake of DHM prior to or simultaneously with the administration of BaP may increase the risk of a BaP-induced tumorigenesis in small intestine.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>35 (Suppl 2), 158-168</Feld596><PubVol>35</PubVol><PubIss>Suppl 2</PubIss><StrtPage>158</StrtPage><EndPage>168</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Hodek P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Fousova P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Brabencova E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Moserova M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Pavek P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Anzenbacherova E" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Brotanek J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="7" name="Hudecek J" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Frei E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="9" name="Stiborova M" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25638381</PMID><KST>G110</KST><KEYWORD>P-GLYCOPROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CYTOCHROME-P450 1A1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>beta-naphthoflavone</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHEMOPREVENTIVE COMPOUNDS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA ADDUCT FORMATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VITRO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METABOLIC-ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>SMALL-INTESTINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ALPHA-NAPHTHOFLAVONE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>LIVER MICROSOMES</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>59525</publishedID><Artikel>Tumor suppressing properties of rodent parvovirus NS1 proteins and their derivatives</Artikel><Journal>Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology</Journal><ABSTr>Cancer chemotherapy with monospecific agents is often hampered by the rapid development of tumor resistance to the drug used. Therefore, combination treatments aiming at several different targets are sought. Viral regulatory proteins, modified or not, appear ideal for this purpose because of their multimodal killing action against neoplastically transformed cells. The large nonstructural protein NS1 of rodent parvoviruses is an excellent candidate for an anticancer agent, shown to interfere specifically with cancer cell growth and survival. The present review describes the structure, functions, and regulation of the multifunctional protein NS1, its specific interference with cell processes and cell protein activities, and what is known so far about the mechanisms underlying NS1 interference with cancer growth. It further outlines prospects for the development of new, multimodal cancer toxins and their potential applications.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>818 (), 99-124</Feld596><PubVol>818</PubVol><PubIss/><StrtPage>99</StrtPage><EndPage>124</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Nuesch JP" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="1" name="Rommelaere J" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25001533</PMID><DOI>10.1007/978-1-4471-6458-6_5</DOI><KST>F010</KST><KEYWORD>MAJOR NONSTRUCTURAL PROTEIN</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANS-ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>KINASE-C</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>MINUTE VIRUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA-REPLICATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>IN-VITRO</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN HEPATOMA-CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ONCOLYTIC PARVOVIRUS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>HUMAN GLIOBLASTOMA CELLS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>P38 PROMOTER</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>59538</publishedID><Artikel>Dicoumarol inhibits rat NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase in vitro and induces its expression in vivo</Artikel><Journal>Neuroendocrinology Letters</Journal><ABSTr>OBJECTIVES: Dicoumarol is known to act as an inhibitor of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1). This cytosolic reductase significantly contributes to the genotoxicity of the nephrotoxic and carcinogenic alkaloid aristolochic acid I (AAI). Aristolochic acid causes aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN), and Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN), as well as associated urothelial malignancies. NQO1 is the most efficient enzyme responsible for the reductive bioactivation of AAI to species forming covalent AAI-DNA adducts. However, it is still not known how dicoumarol influences the NQO1-mediated reductive bioactivation of AAI. METHODS: AAI-DNA adduct formation was determined by 32P-postlabeling. Expression of NQO1 mRNA and NQO1 protein was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting, respectively. RESULTS: In this study, dicoumarol inhibited AAI bioactivation to form AAI-DNA adducts mediated by rat and human NQO1 in vitro as expected. We however, demonstrated that dicoumarol acts as an inducer of NQO1 in kidney and lung of rats treated with this NQO1 inhibitor in vivo, both at protein and activity levels. This NQO1 induction increased the potency of kidney cytosol to bioactivate AAI and elevated AAI-DNA adduct levels were found in ex-vivo incubations of AAI with renal cytosols and DNA. NQO1 mRNA levels were induced in liver only by dicoumarol. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate a dual role of dicoumarol in NQO1-mediated genotoxicty of AAI. It acts both as an NQO1 inhibitor mainly in vitro and as an NQO1 inducer if administered to rats.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>35 (Suppl 2), 123-132</Feld596><PubVol>35</PubVol><PubIss>Suppl 2</PubIss><StrtPage>123</StrtPage><EndPage>132</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Stiborova M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Levova K" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="2" name="Barta F" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="3" name="Dracinska H" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Sulc M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="5" name="Hodek P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="6" name="Frei E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="7" name="Arlt VM" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="8" name="Schmeiser HH" IsDKFZ="1"/><PMID>25638376</PMID><KST>E030</KST><KST>G110</KST><KEYWORD>BALKAN ENDEMIC NEPHROPATHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CHINESE HERBS NEPHROPATHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DT-DIAPHORASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>urothelial cancer</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CYTOCHROMES P450 1A1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ANTICANCER DRUG ELLIPTICINE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NAD(P)H-QUINONE OXIDOREDUCTASE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ARISTOLACTAM-DNA ADDUCTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METABOLIC-ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>ARISTOLOCHIC ACID I</KEYWORD></row><row><publishedID>59539</publishedID><Artikel>Enzymes oxidizing the azo dye 1-phenylazo-2-naphthol (Sudan I) and their contribution to its genotoxicity and carcinogenicity</Artikel><Journal>Current Drug Metabolism</Journal><ABSTr>Sudan I [1-(phenylazo)-2-naphthol, C.I. Solvent Yellow 14] is an industrial dye, which was found as a contaminant in numerous foods in several European countries. Because Sudan I has been assigned by the IARC as a Category 3 carcinogen, the European Union decreed that it cannot be utilized as food colorant in any European country. Sudan I induces the malignancies in liver and urinary bladder of rats and mice. This carcinogen has also been found to be a potent mutagen, contact allergen and sensitizer, and exhibits clastogenic properties. The oxidation of Sudan I increases its toxic effects and leads to covalent adducts in DNA. Identification of enzymatic systems that contribute to Sudan I oxidative metabolism to reactive intermediates generating such covalent DNA adducts on the one hand, and to the detoxification of this carcinogen on the other, is necessary to evaluate susceptibility to this toxicant. This review summarizes the identification of such enzymes and the molecular mechanisms of oxidation reactions elucidated to date. Human and animal cytochrome P450 (CYP) and peroxidases are capable of oxidizing Sudan I. Of the CYP enzymes, CYP1A1 is most important both in Sudan I detoxification and its bio-activation. Ring-hydroxylated metabolites and a dimer of this carcinogen were found as detoxification products of Sudan I generated with CYPs and peroxidases, respectively. Oxidative bio-activation of this azo dye catalyzed by CYPs and peroxidases leads to generation of proximate genotoxic metabolites (the CYP-catalyzed formation of the benzenediazonium cation and the peroxidase-mediated generation of one-electron oxidation products), which covalently modify DNA both in vitro and in vivo. The predominant DNA adduct generated with the benzenediazonium cation was characterized to be 8-(phenylazo)guanine. The Sudan I radical species mediated by peroxidases reacts with the -NH2 group in (deoxy)guanosine, generating the 4-[(deoxy)guanosin-N(2)-yl]Sudan I product. Sudan I was also found to be a strong inducer of CYP1A1 and its enzyme activity mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, thereby increasing its own genotoxic potential and the cancer risk for humans.</ABSTr><PubYear>2014</PubYear><Feld596>15 (8), 829-840</Feld596><PubVol>15</PubVol><PubIss>8</PubIss><StrtPage>829</StrtPage><EndPage>840</EndPage><Author Pos="0" name="Stiborova M" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="1" name="Schmeiser HH" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="2" name="Frei E" IsDKFZ="1"/><Author Pos="3" name="Hodek P" IsDKFZ="0"/><Author Pos="4" name="Martinek V" IsDKFZ="0"/><PMID>25658126</PMID><KST>E030</KST><KST>G110</KST><KEYWORD>SOLVENT YELLOW 14</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>METABOLIC-ACTIVATION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BONE-MARROW</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>NON-AMINOAZO DYE</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>BENZENEDIAZONIUM ION</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>TRANSFER-RIBONUCLEIC-ACID</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PERFORMANCE LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>DNA-ADDUCTS</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>CYTOCHROME-P450 1A1</KEYWORD><KEYWORD>PROSTAGLANDIN-H SYNTHASE</KEYWORD></row></datei>
